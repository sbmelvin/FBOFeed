The purpose of this Task Order is to enhance the Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW) and continue to operate the Research Data Distribution Center (RDDC) to support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER). These enhancements will enable CCW to provide a unique data resource to support CER. It will support longitudinal analysis of Medicare data from 1999 through present, link data across the continuum of care, be representative of the full Medicare population, and provide a large enough data set to support the study of small populations and relatively rare events. The Data enhancements will require the acquisition of additional hardware and software to have the capability of supporting this larger data warehouse. This will double the size of the Medicare population data in the CCW database and add ten years of dual eligible (Medicare/Medicaid) beneficiaries data to the database. In addition, the contractor will add other data sources to the Medicare administrative data in order to support a broad range of comparative effective projects. It is anticipated that by using a very large administrative claims database and by mining ten years of Medicare/Medicaid utilization data, information can be obtained faster that highlights what works in health care. This information can be used to develop practice guidelines and other methods to promote informed health care decision making. In addition to the CER enhancements, this Task Order includes the purchase of National Death Index data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). CMS has an application with NCHS to obtain this data. The contractor will be responsible for incorporating the data into the database for CER projects and for maintaining the CER enhanced database and making the data available to internal and external CMS researchers. The period of performance is twenty-four months.

<DESC>This notice is provided for informational purposes only. This opportunity is available only to the existing awardee of the CMS Task Order HHSM-500-2009-00034U which was issued under DHHS' Strategic Sourcing Events Management BPA. This BPA was competitively awarded under the procedures of FAR 8.4. <br /><br />The ARRA provides incentives and support for the adoption of certified electronic health records (EHRs) for Medicare and Medicaid eligible professionals and hospitals. The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) is overseeing and administering the incentive program in coordination with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). In support of this initiative, CMS hosted a two-day Multi-State collaborative conference to address several aspects of implementation critical to increased State understanding and adoption. CMS awarded a task order for planning and meeting support services for this effort. Due to the severe winter storms that significantly reduced both the opportunities for presentations and attendance, and the high demand for the information provided at the conference, CMS has committed to sharing the full panel presentations with states and other stakeholders via a series of six webcasts to begin in March. CMS intends to require the continued support of the current task order awardee for the webcasts via a change order to the existing task order. <br />

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals under solicitation number 10-223-SOL-00065 (subject to change) for an initiative called "Partnership in Applied Comparative Effectiveness Science" (PACES). PACES is an initiative that seeks to advance the science for such CER studies through leveraging available data, in particular the joint ARRA FDA-CER efforts, to form an enhanced standardized database, Janus. The NAICS Code is 541712 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement will be funded by the Recovery Act. <br />
<p>A. Project Background</p>
<p>Initiatives to compare the effectiveness of different medical interventions and approaches to their delivery have attracted tremendous interest. While comparative effectiveness research (CER) has typically been associated with enhancing the efficiency in the use of health care resources, there is a broader vision of the potential goals and benefits of such research. CER could extend beyond the application of specific intervention methods to controlled clinical trials or within specific health care settings. For example CER could be used to better understand what interventions work best for individuals and subgroups within populations.</p>
<p>As such, CER can be instrumental in supporting and driving the development of personalized medicine, and improving not only the efficiency of care, but also outcomes for all individuals. The science can be used to increase patient benefit, by identifying individuals who are most likely to benefit from an intervention, and to reduce risks, by identifying and protecting individuals who may be harmed. The hope of personalized medicine is that new and existing therapies and devices will be used in combination with improved diagnostic assessments to develop a tailored strategy for treating each patient. <br />A significant step in achieving this goal is to define subtypes or subpopulations of patients with disease, such that different therapies, often with different targets and mechanisms of action, can be compared with respect to how they perform in each of these subtypes. Within the FDA, the intent is to help provide a scientific framework that can capitalize on increased CER efforts to better realize these goals of personalized medicine.</p>
<p>The FDA houses the largest known repository of clinical study data--including data on drug biologics and devices safety, effectiveness and performance. These data are an invaluable resource for CER. Both pre- and post-approval data collected and housed at the FDA can be combined with other datasets on long term health outcomes that reside in other agencies or the private sector. As personalized medicine develops, FDA expects an increase in the need for comparisons across products (and associated delivery mechanisms) to define how these products should be used in combination for individualized health care before and after FDA approval. Development and use of sound, consistent science-based approaches to the design, conduct and analysis of such data and the assessment for labeling and regulatory purposes, will be critical.</p>
<p><br />B. Objective</p>
<p>The Partnership in Applied Comparative Effectiveness Science (PACES) is an initiative that seeks to advance the science for such CER studies through leveraging available data, in particular the joint ARRA FDA-CER efforts, to form an enhanced standardized database, Janus. The PACES initiative will be conducted with a contractor who has biological, and clinically relevant computational expertise. The contractor will work with FDA Center scientific and statistical experts to define questions, datasets and approaches for performing complex analyses for comparative and multi-study analyses on FDA and other large clinical datasets. As part of this effort, the contractor will conduct analyses on defined datasets including datasets previously developed as part the joint Janus initiative, where FDA's Center's specific questions will drive the data transformed, standardized and loaded into the Janus data warehouse. Additionally, the contractor will be expected to participate in FDA-hosted scientific workshops that address issues such as methods for cross-study and other comparative analyses, best practices in CER, and candidate studies and their design and analysis methods. These strategies will also encompass clinical trial designs that can help advance personalized medicine and health outcomes both within and outside of the FDA.</p>
<p>C. Scope:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall conduct CER. This work effort shall include four principle components as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Component 1- The Contractor shall plan and organize the CER project with FDA stakeholders, including participation in annual FDA-hosted planning workshops (three workshops, two days each) to define candidate CER questions and priorities, analyses strategies and datasets to be utilized. <br />&bull; Component 2- The Contractor shall provide training on methodologies developed to FDA staff during two of the FDA-hosted planning workshops. <br />&bull; Component 3 - The Contractor shall identify or develop appropriate analytic methodologies for CER and apply them to FDA and/or other data; develop new scientific computing strategies and hone existing computational strategies to perform these CER analyses. The Contractor shall prepare reports and manuscripts of the results suitable for publication in scientific journals. <br />&bull; Component 4- The Contractor shall develop innovative clinical trial design strategies for prospective CER clinical trials and analyses of healthcare data including providing formal recommendations for best practices for submission of studies to the FDA when they involve product comparisons. These strategies and recommendations shall be documented in reports and manuscripts suitable for publication in scientific journals.</p>
<p>D. Additional Information</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one (1) or more contracts will be awarded with a three (3) year base period from&nbsp;August 01, 2010 to&nbsp;July 31, 2013 with two (2) one (1) year options. FDA intends to solicit this requirement as a Full and Open competitive requirement. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). The solicitation will be an upload to this pre-solicitation notice. NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ENTERTAINED. Please send questions or comments in writing to Dominique.Malone@fda.hhs.gov. It is up to interested parties to check this site for the release of the solicitation as it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated release date of the solicitation will on or around April 30, 2010. Please watch this synopsis for updated information (if any) to the release date. The anticipated award date for this effort is&nbsp;August 2010.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with Physik Instrumente L.P. of Auburn, Massachusetts for the purchase of a High-Dynamics Precision XYZ Nanopositioning System.<br /><br />NIST cites FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.<br /><br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: NIST Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory is developing two independent instruments for measuring the motion of nanostructures with the intention of providing a direct comparison between two unique measurement techniques. NIST currently owns a nanopositioning stage with control electronics from Physik Instrumente for one of these instruments. Since NIST will be performing a direct comparison between the two measurement techniques, all elements of the experiments must be the same. Both instruments will scan a sample through a laser, which is performed by the nanopositioning stage. The output from the position sensors located in the nanopositioning stage are correlated with other measurement data. The design of the position sensors and measurement electronics are patented by Physik Instrumente and cannot be replicated. In addition, Physik Instrumente has developed a software library for commanding the motion of their nanopositioning stages, which is called the General Command Set (GCS). GCS is a proprietary software package that can only be provided by Physik Instrumente. NIST is using the GCS to develop scanning software and requires that the software work on both instruments. Physik Instrumente is the sole manufacturer and distributor of this product. As a result, Physik Instrumente is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on April 12, 2010. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to joshua.holliday@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), strives to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent immunologic, infectious, and allergic diseases The NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation intends to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA-NIAID-DAIT-NIHAI2010093) entitled "Nonhuman Primate Major Histocompatibility Complex Gene Discovery and Typing Technology Development".<br /><br />NHPs approximate the human in physiology, immunology, and genetics more closely than other animals and, therefore, are often the preferred models to: 1) evaluate the safety and efficacy of candidate vaccines against human pathogens; 2) develop and evaluate immune-based therapeutic strategies to prevent graft rejection and graft versus host disease in cell and organ transplantation; and 3) study the pathogenesis of, and evaluate novel immune-based therapies for infectious and immune-mediated disease. To support these continuing research efforts the NIAID announces the re-competition of the NHP Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Gene Discovery and Typing Technology Development Program. The objectives of this program are to facilitate and enhance the immunological research conducted with this important model by providing detailed knowledge of NHP MHC genes, loci and alleles through gene discovery and genomic characterization studies; and by developing and providing readily accessible means or methods to genotype individual research animals for the complete set of MHC alleles, or for select alleles, for the optimum design of experiments and genetic management of colonies.
<p>The most commonly used NHP species in immunological and infectious disease research are the Old World NHPs, including the cynomolgus or long-tailed macaque (Macaca fasicularis), the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), the baboon (multiple Papio species), sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys) and the pigtail macaque (Macaca nemestrina). For purposes of the background information of the NHP MHC below, NHP is used to denote the Old World monkey Macaca sp., unless where otherwise noted.</p>
<p>As in the human genome, the MHC region is the most polymorphic of the NHP genome, with a high degree of genetic diversity across the population. The MHC region includes MHC Class I and II genes, which encode cell surface proteins that serve a critical role in the adaptive immune response. NHP MHC Class I and II orthologs for the Old World macaques exist for most of the human MHC genes. However, a striking difference between the human and the rhesus macaque is that the NHP MHC Class I loci have undergone multiple duplication and expansion events resulting in a significantly greater number of expressed MHC Class I A and B genes per animal than in humans. In addition, the numbers of MHC Class I A and B loci can differ significantly between animals within a population. The NHP MHC Class II region also has been subject to more gene duplication and expansion than its human counterpart. Studies of other macaque species reveal similarly increased MHC genomic complexity over that of humans and great apes.</p>
<p>The NHP MHC Class I and II regions' genomic organization has had limited detailed characterization, with complete phased genomic sequencing of only two (2) haplotypes of a single rhesus. Due, in part, to the evidence of great variability in the numbers of loci between individual animals, knowledge of the genomic structure from multiple haplotypes and species of NHPs is needed to resolve the MHC organization and facilitate gene discovery efforts. Although progress has been made towards MHC Class I allele discovery for the Indian rhesus macaque, considerable gene, locus, and allele discovery work is still needed for this and most other macaque species and subspecies as are MHC Class II discovery efforts. Coupled with gene discovery is the need to define which genes are expressed, including any conditional or cell/tissue-specific expression patterns, and to establish allele or haplotype frequencies within individual colonies or sources of animals used by the research community.</p>
<p>Identification of the complete set of MHC alleles present in an animal has historically required technically challenging and time- and labor-intensive methods and no certainty that all alleles or loci within an individual were detected. Furthermore, the availability of defined genotyping methods or resources for typing of individual alleles is quite limited compared to the large number of alleles already identified. Development of, and accessibility to, high-throughput technologies for MHC allele genotyping and/or haplotype determination are required to accelerate immunological studies in NHP species. Historically, the variety of DNA-based methods have included: reference strand conformational analysis (RSCA), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), sequence-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP), sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP) and MHC-linked microsatellites, or short tandem repeats (STRs). The level and accuracy of information provided and the potential limitations differ by technique.</p>
<p>A variety of DNA-based technologies is required for the diverse needs of the NHP research community, including those methods for specific allele genotyping, haplotyping, and complete MHC genotyping. Affordable methods that are easily upgraded as new allelic or haplotype information becomes available are needed, and, for those methods not provided through resource services, they need to be relatively high-throughput and easily translated to laboratories conducting NHP research.</p>
<p>This solicitation to re-compete the NHP MHC Gene Discovery and Typing Development Program will continue and expand upon the initial program goals to advance the detailed knowledge base of NHP MHC genetic loci, alleles, and haplotypes, and their frequencies; better define the NHP MHC genomic organization; and develop robust, high-throughput genotyping and haplotyping methods.</p>
<p>The NIAID anticipates a single multi-year, cost reimbursement completion-type award will be made utilizing FAR Subpart 17.1, for a five (5) year period of performance, beginning on or about April 1, 2011. The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research. In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed five 5 years.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency. This BAA will be available electronically on/about April 13, 2010, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items or slightly modified COTS items under FAR Part 13 prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the request for quote for the required items under Request for Quote (RFQ) N61331-10 T-0005. A subsequent solicitation document will not be issued. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division intends to award a sole source firm fixed price commercial contract for the following:
CLIN 0001 -  two (2) each LCS Matrix Switch P/N 03-02-004-00CLIN 0002 - two (2) each 100 watt VHF amplifier (PRC-117PA) P/N 03-03-010-00CLIN 0003 - two (2) each LCS Matrix Switch Upgrades P/N 03-02-005-00
These COTS items are being requisitioned in support of the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Multi-Vehicle Communication System (MVCS) project. These items are manufactured by North Star Scientific Corporation (NSS) of Kapollei, HI.  These items are not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  The NSS parts were selected in development of the original test bed MVCS as a result of testing multiple vendors to locate the best possible solution for this amplifier and matrix switch that would meet MIL-STD-810F and MIL-STD-461 requirements for use in a surface ship environment.  As a result, the NSS design and form factor has been delivered to an LCS Ship and is planned for other LCS Ships.  Any modification to the MVCS design to support different components will adversely affect the delivery date required to support ship install and would entail costly and time consuming testing to ensure 100% compatibility with existing MVCS hardware and software.  NSS, as the original equipment manufacturer of the parts, is the only source that can meet this requirement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>The contract was awarded on June 23, 2009 to Johnson Roofing &amp; Construction, Inc., an active participant in the SBA 8(a) Business Development Program, in the amount of $1,396,886.00. The project has since been modified. Prior to modification PS05, the contract totals $1,402,288.79. With the addition of modification PS05 ($139,930.00), the contract total will be $1,542,218.79. With the issuance of modification PS05, this project will be part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).</p>
<p>The purpose of this modification is to provide a complete solar photovoltaic (PV) system to the roof replacement project. This PV system is a complete set of components that will convert sunlight into electricity by the photovoltaic process. Using solar energy systems to provide heat and electricity will help conserve fossil fuel resources. Furthermore, because solar energy systems do not emit harmful pollutants, they also help protect the environment. The installation of the PV system will adhere to the Federal Government's mission of creating jobs, stimulating the economy and transforming Federal buildings into high performance green buildings.</p>

<p>GSA announces an opportunity for a VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS with management experience in the design, construction, and commissioning of large, complex, modernization projects to provide professional Commissioning Agent (CxA) Services for design stage, construction stage, and post-construction stage commissioning of the Modernization of the Byron G. Rogers U.S. Federal Building. Award of the Commissioning Agent (CxA) Services Contract is anticipated for December 2009. Anticipated start date for construction is on or about February 1, 2010. The current estimated contract value is between $1,500,000 and $2,500,000. The estimated Design Build contract is estimated at $100,000,000 to $125,000,000. The estimated project duration (design and construction) is approximately 48 months after Notice to Proceed (NTP).</p>
<p>This high performance green building project will continue the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation through the preservation and modernization of a historic federal building. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program commissions our nation's most talented architects, engineers, landscape architects, and interior designers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 - 100 years of service. GSA Design Excellence projects demonstrate the merit of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs, aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give public expression to our democratic values.</p>
<p>As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). All GSA projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific credits required. Projects in or affecting historic properties must comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. This facility must be designed in metric units.</p>
<p>The design and construction of this project will be delivered through the Design-Build delivery method under separate contract.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The project consists of a major modernization upgrade project for the Byron G. Rogers Federal Office Building (FB) and a window replacement project for the adjacent Byron G. Rogers U.S. Courthouse. This work is performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The FB occupies a prominent position in the Federal District of downtown Denver. It is an existing multi-tenant professional office building with 18 stories and a basement. The FB contains 494,156 gross square feet (GSF), 437,551 rentable square feet (RSF), and 329,433 usable square feet (USF). The current FB tenants will be relocated prior to the start of the modernization project. Agencies to be located in the federal building will be the Commission on Civil Rights, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, Social Security Administration, and the General Services Administration.<br />The courthouse is a multi-tenant office and court building. It is five stories high with a basement and subbasement connected to the FB by a two story section. This section contains building services, a loading dock, and a two lane ramp to the parking garage. The courthouse houses six major tenants including United States District Court, Court Administrative Support Center, Probation and Pre-Trial Services, U.S. 10th Circuit Library, 10th Circuit Mediation and the United States Marshals Service. The building is approximately 248,000 GSF including two levels of underground parking spaces within the basement and sub-basement. A comprehensive modernization project for the courthouse was completed in 2005. The courthouse will remain occupied while the windows are replaced. The federal building and courthouse are located at 1961 Stout Street, Denver, Colorado, 80294. Both buildings are long-term GSA-held assets situated in a prime location near downtown with public transportation within the central business district, in the Federal District of downtown Denver, with a stable tenant base and a high reinvestment need.</p>
<p>Project goals and objectives for the federal building are to provide a pleasant, secure, and safe environment for the staff and visitors consistent with guidelines for Federal facilities and specifically the GSA PBS P-100; satisfy current and projected special-use needs, and allow for future expansion of these requirements; design facilities compatible with the tenants' existing character and local context, and present a positive image of U.S. Government facilities; use the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, which is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance green buildings. GSA requires all new construction, renovation, and modernization projects to be certified through the LEED program; owing to the historic significance of the building, all work will follow the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Illustrated Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, Revised 1992 (36 CFR 67); upgrade the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; upgrade the mechanical piping, heating, and hot water systems; upgrade the electrical system and install new telecommunications infrastructure; modernize all elevators; remove all asbestos containing materials (ACMs); implement GSA's workplace procedures and achieve measurable effectiveness results; identify design strategies that work to optimize the project's access to energy from seasonal solar, natural lighting, and wind to reduce undesirable loads and maximize desirable loads to meet desired energy targets for the facility; upgrade by replacing all public and private restrooms, plumbing systems, and fixtures; upgrade building security; replace underground water and waste water service lines.</p>

<p>PROCUREMENT STRATEGY</p>
<p>The General Services Administration intends to award a firm-fixed price Contract based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Brooks Act Procurement, FAR Subpart 36.3, Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include phase-two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 36.303. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require contractor interviews/presentations at the Denver Federal Center, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>
<p>The RFQ will be issued electronically after 07/29/2009 on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</p>

<p>AFMETCAL is considering a purchase a Low Power Gamma Measurement System.<br />The Low Power 50 GHz Calibration System will calibrate low power coaxial standards and general power sensing TMDE. The system will be able to provide a standardized power level ranging from min 0.01mW to 10mW. The frequency range of the system will be 100 Khz to 50 GHz. The command and control functions of the system will be automated and a GUI will provide for a fully automated calibration process. The system will be based upon the NIST developed Direct Comparison Power System (DCPS). The total estimated quantity is 10 units. <br />Hardware:<br />Separate feed-thru RF power standards for the range 100 kHz to 18 GHz and 10 MHz to 50 GHz to provide smooth, single connection calibration of most sensors and provide reduced wear and damage opportunity on the fragile 2.4mm connector of the 50 GHz standard.<br />Standards based on long-proven direct DC substitution technology for minimum drift, best linearity, lowest uncertainty, and a design lineage to calorimeter artifacts.<br />Standard monitors incorporating latest digital technology, coordinating with software to digitally level to any set power with steps limited only by the generator, and capable of direct power read-out from any commercially produced thermistor mount.<br />Software: <br />Automate the calibration process, including Gamma Correction, Dynamic Uncertainty Calculation, and collection of S11 data using either of two methods:<br />Control Vector Network Analyzers, OR Using multiple offset lines (with supporting beads for robustness), performs multiple RF power measurements and estimate vector S11. Although this method has higher uncertainty than VNA at low reflections, it will be adequate to dramatically reduce power calibration error in labs without VNA's.<br />Perform manufacturer's specified linearity checks and reports pass-fail and calculates adjusted factors if adjustment procedures are available from the manufacturer.<br />Writes calibration factors and other adjustment factors into power sensor EEPROM.<br />Is designed to support RF power standards requiring customized power balancing bridges that are "read" using voltmeters. Type IV bridges and power meters with proportional output will be supported. This allows use with both legacy power meters and the Primary Standards.<br />designed to expose well-documented function-oriented methods that will allow Air Force AFMETCAL NextGen programmers to implement "higher-level" test management such as:<br />Recipe/Procedure Management, Test reporting, Customized data reporting.</p>

<p><br />SOW is as follows:</p>
<p>The VACTOR truck is used for the clearing and cleaning of sanitary sewer mains and laterals and sanitary sewer manholes. The vehicle is capable of clearing debris stoppages with its high pressure 500' jetting nozzles and cutters in all pipe sizes ranging from 4" to 20" diameter and any type of pipe material in which the sanitary sewer collection mains where constructed. The Vehicle is used for clearing slogged up storm drains and collection basins and closed culverts. The vehicle vacuum system is used in critical "Wet Excavation" process which allows the shop personnel to excavate a water or gas or sewer line break that is located were other utilities have congested the work area, IE; If a water main is leaking and electric, telephone, fiber optic, cable TV and gas are in the same trench there is a high probability that a repair done with a backhoe excavation will damage an existing utilities needlessly. The VACTOR allows the work area to be Vacuumed out with no damage to existing utilities and has saved the AFFTC untold tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

What does a logical hardware design look like for the bases/ESU locations, e.g., how many and what type of devices will be required to manage all the storage in the AF and where will they need to be located?<br />3. Does the proposed capability/concept rely on any proprietary standards to meet any AF or DoD requirements?<br />4. Does your solution currently exist off-the-shelf or is it under development?<br />&bull; If under development, when will it be available for purchase/delivery?<br />&bull; If it currently exists, has it passed the DoD Information Assurance Certification &amp; Accreditation Process (DIACAP)? Sustainment/Warranty? Are quantity discounts available? Is it deployed? If so, where? Who are your customers?<br />5. Can the solution manage SAN, NAS, and file server storage?<br />&bull; If the solution cannot manage one of the above, expand on the specific situations where it can and cannot (i.e. only works with certain vendors, works in only certain configurations, etc.) <br />6. Is the capability able to be deployed and maintained with no prior training?<br />&bull; What kind of training is available for the maintainers? On-line/CBTs, classroom, on/off-site, etc.?<br />7. How many simultaneous users can be connected to the solution at a given time?<br />8. How many simultaneous connections to end storage can be made from the solution at a given time?<br />9. How does the proposed concept manage/support disaster recovery? <br />&bull; Can the solution/concept support Full, Differential, and Incremental back-ups directly to an off-site location? ...on-site location?<br />&bull; Can the solution/concept support a real-time remote hot site?<br />&bull; Can the solution/concept support automated client/server back-ups?<br />10.

<a href="mailto:jeneane.solomon@us.army.mil">RDECOM Contracting Center - Edgewood (RDECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice and does not constitute a solicitation for proposal.<BR><BR>The Joint Product Manager, Consequence Management (JPM-CM), is conducting market research to identify potential sources with the capability of providing real-time/near real-time Radiological Rapid Area Survey and Surveillance.  More specifically, the instrument/system will be required to perform real-time/near real-time encrypted wireless transmission to the operations/tactical center of radiological field strength readings and background radiation levels.  The detection area of focus is for Gamma radiation.  The reach back transmission data should include date/time, radiation reading, and GPS location.  In addition, the instrument/system shall have the capability to be man portable and can be operated unobtrusively in a crowd situation.  The instrument/system is intended to be applied while walking (hands free operation).  Solutions using the Armys current radiation detection equipment (i.e.:  PDR-77 and UDR-13) are welcomed and encouraged.  More detailed Thresholds and Objectives are identified in the ensuing paragraphs.<BR><BR>Mission - The instrument/system is intended for the National Guard Bureau Civil Support Teams (NGB-CSTs).  The CST mission is to support civil authorities at a domestic CBRNE incident site by identifying CBRNE agents/substances, accessing current and projected consequences, advising on response measures, and assisting with appropriate requests for additional state support.  CST support to a pre-staged large public event (e.g., conventions, concerts, political, athletic), and other major events with significant populace attendance which are potential targets of terrorist interest.  The CSTs primary mission is to respond to, assess, and assist mitigation activities for weapons of mass destruction events within the United States and territories.  To perform these missions, the CSTs must be equipped to perform Radiological Rapid Area Survey and Surveillance. <BR> <BR>Environment - CST operations for the above described mission sets may involve the full range of environments from open areas to constrained spaces, dry/wet conditions, seasonal temperatures, flat terrain to complex urban terrain, with and without debris, ground to multi-level structures,  with the possibility of contact with contaminants.  <BR>For pre-staged events:  the CSTs deploy prior to the scheduled event. The presence of large crowds is anticipated.  Event locations can range from open space (e.g., field, grass, large open flat terrain) to structures (e.g., convention centers, stadiums, and multi- level architecture).<BR><BR>For Consequence Management events:  the CSTs deploy following the detonation or release of a suspected weapon of mass destruction.  Simple to complex terrain (e.g., flat and open area to multi-level buildings and roads within a city), possibly hazardous conditions (e.g., downed electrical wires, broken water and gas lines), presence of airborne and surface contaminants, the range of climatic conditions, possibility of constrained spaces and damaging debris, are all potential environmental impacts upon CST operations.<BR><BR>Operational Application - The Rapid Radiological Survey Instrument/system will be applied differently for the two mission sets described above.  <BR><BR>In the pre-staged event/mission: Prior to the event, the CST performs background readings to record naturally occurring radiation levels and to map and characterize the intended area.  During the event, the CST will apply the instrument/system to determine if there is a change from the mapped background readings.  The instrument/system will provide the user with visible and audible Gamma Radiation level readings while recording the information and simultaneously transmitting the data back to the tactical operations center for real-time/near real-time display.  The CST member would rapidly survey the site as well as determine the presence and location of any radiological devices or sources.  The CST may also apply the device similarly to an event portal/entrance for the rapid and unobtrusive screening of entering crowds.<BR><BR>In the Consequence Management event/mission:  the CST will map the contamination area, not only to identify the boundaries of radiological contamination, but also to map radiological intensities within the event perimeter.  The CST member using the instrument/system will walk through the event zone.  The instrument/system will provide the user with visible and audible Gamma Radiation level readings.  In addition, the instrument/system will record the information and simultaneously transmit the data back to the tactical operations center for real-time/near real-time display.  Upon completion of the activity, the instrument/system is decontaminated and prepared for subsequent use.<BR><BR>Requirements - There are two types of requirements criteria:  Threshold and Objective.  Threshold is the minimum requirement the instrument/system must meet.  Objective is the desired capabilities for the instrument/system. <BR>Threshold and objective requirements are shown in the attached file.<BR><BR>Interested sources that believe they can meet the above requirements shall provide the U.S. Army a description of their proposed item and how it meets the requirements and a brief summary of their companys capabilities.  Information, at a minimum, should include:  Informational brochures, published technical specifications, 3rd party performance verification, company name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, and type of business (large or small) and point of contact. <BR><BR>Participation in the JPM-CM survey is voluntary, and the government does not intend to pay any costs associated with this sources sought announcement. Failure to provide detailed information to the survey may limit opportunities for product(s) to be considered for future requirements associated with this program. <BR><BR>This Market Survey is for planning purpose only and should not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the U.S. Government.  The U.S. Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Market Survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. There will be no opportunity for questions and answers associated with this RFI.<BR><BR>All proprietary data that the respondent intends to be used only by the Government for evaluation purposes must be identified and appropriately marked.  See Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 3.104.4; 52.215-1(e).  The respondent must also identify all technical data contained in the white paper that is to be treated by the Government as subject to restrictive markings.  In the absence of such identification, the Government will assume to have unlimited rights to all technical data submitted.<BR><BR> Submissions are to be sent to the following address USA RDECOM Acquisition Center, Edgewood Contracting Division, ATTN:  CCRD-ED, Tonya Brailey-Jordan, E4455 Leitzan Road, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD  21010-5424 to be received not later than 5:00 pm on May 25, 2010.<BR> <BR>

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The government reserves the right to hold discussions during the process of product standardization.  In addition, the government reserves the right to cancel this standardization action in its entirety if indicated.

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have, or be in the process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is June 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 4:00 PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region will be digitally signed by the issuer. 

Emails and correspondence may be sent to jquinn8@live.com

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  When requested, vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:

1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting.  The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.  
2.	The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review.  The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  
3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. 

a.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
 (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

a.	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Vendors must provide an initial response to each Technical/Company criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of IV Administration Sets and Accessories. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  

a.	At a minimum, a complete product line includes, but is not limited to, the functional equivalent in all sizes of the products below:

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1.	The drip chamber is clear and allows visualization of drops 
	a. Promotes accurate drip rate to deliver proper amount of fluid/drug prescribed
	b. Evaluator will assess by filling drip chamber and visualizing drops

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor [The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. 

It is anticipated that an award will be made on initial offers without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to open up discussions if necessary.

Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

THE CLOSING DATE IS 19 APRIL 2010 4PM EST.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought
---------------
A.	 General Information

The Tri-Service Mid-Atlantic Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, and Air Force medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Virginia and North Carolina announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of IV Start Kits. Vendors are required to supply a complete product line. At a minimum, a complete product line includes, but is not limited to, the functional equivalent in all sizes of the products listed below: 

	Kit IV Start, 2 Gloves, Tourniquet, Alcohol Swab, Gauze Adhesive Bandage, Tape Transparent Dressing, and Extension Set

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The government reserves the right to hold discussions during the process of product standardization.  In addition, the government reserves the right to cancel this standardization action in its entirety if indicated.

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have, or be in the process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is March 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

Vendors that do not meet the deadline of 4:00 PM EST on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region will be digitally signed by the issuer. 

Emails and correspondence may be sent to jquinn8@live.com (preferred) james.quinn@gdit.com (secondary).

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  When requested, vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:

1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting.  The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.  
2.	The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review.  The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  
3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. 

a.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
 (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

a.	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Vendors must provide an initial response to each Technical/Company criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of IV Start Kits. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  

a.	At a minimum, a complete product line includes, but is not limited to, the functional equivalent in all sizes of the products below:

	Kit IV Start, 2 Gloves, Tourniquet, Alcohol Swab, Gauze Adhesive Bandage, Tape Transparent Dressing, and Extension Set
	
Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.
2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the IV Start Kits product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
3.	Vendors must have, or be obtaining, a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Owens and Minor) for distribution in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
4.	Vendors must agree to submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  
5.	Vendors must provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address of local vendor representative for the Mid-Atlantic Region. 
6.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the IV Start Kits products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question. 
7.	Vendors must have a return goods policy, and should provide a copy of the policy with the initial submittal responding to this RFQ. 
8.	Vendors must provide a copy of their companys customer service policy and program 
9.	Vendors are required to provide the brands your company manufactures and/or distributes.
10.	Vendors must provide an option to obtain products that are latex-free or otherwise hypo-allergenic.  
11.	Vendors must agree that, when requested, they will provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and competitive product cross reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format 

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Pricing Analysis Process:

Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who have met the technical/company criteria will progress to the clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples and literature concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested. 



Clinical Evaluation Process

For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

The samples to be provided will include as a minimum, but not limited to, the functional equivalent of the following products:

 Kit IV Start, 2 Gloves, Tourniquet, Alcohol Swab, Gauze Adhesive Bandage, Tape Transparent Dressing, and Extension Set

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1. The kit is easily opened and the contents readily assessable
a. Reduces the amount of time needed for staff to establish a stable & sterile IV site.
b. Evaluator will assess by opening and utilizing IV Start Kit contents
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b

2. The kit provides for a stable and secure IV line
a. Provides for reliable IV access for medication delivery, hydration, and blood draw.  
b. Evaluator will assess by opening and utilizing IV Start Kit contents
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b

3. The contents are made of high quality material.
a. Provides for long term reliable IV access thus necessitating fewer needle sticks
b. Evaluator will assess by opening and utilizing IV Start Kit contents
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. 

It is anticipated that an award will be made on initial offers without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to open up discussions if necessary.


Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

Fire Records Digitization Project

NAICS CODE:  561410


Description:  The USDA Forest Service (FS) is issuing this Request for Information as part of market research for the availability of potential sources interested in developing and implementing a digitization process for fire records created as a result of trespass fire suppression on National Forest System lands.

During recent years, since the centralization of the FS Claims Program and the establishment of Department of Justice (DOJ) Fire Cost Recovery Litigation Teams, the Government has recovered approximately $200 million in suppression and resource damage costs resulting from trespass wildfires.  In order to support these cases during the billing and litigation processes, the Agency must identify, gather, certify and analyze various types and volumes of fire records for each incident.  This is necessary in order to support the total damage amount being sought.

Past and current processes involve locating and gathering these records after the fire is out and the documents are disbursed to a multitude of offices around the country.  In addition to being extremely time-consuming and requiring resources that many offices do not have, the processes often result in the loss or misplacement of some records. 

The types of records involved include cost documents (contracts, payroll, travel, fleet, etc.) and action/decision documents (incident history, administrative records and large maps).  Historically, fire cost documents have been stored at the units that provided the resources; the action/decision documents have been stored at the incident unit as fire boxes.

Objectives:  The overall objectives of the Fire Records Digitization Project are to:

 Provide legally acceptable and admissible electronic Agency records for claims-related litigation.  These records must meet Agency and Department standards.  
 Protect all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and any other Privacy Act Information;
 Electronically capture and preserve fire records in a timely manner, as soon as the incident is over, to prevent loss and misplacement of any documents;
 Provide a master electronic file containing copies of all original fire documents, one which can be duplicated for various uses (listed above), eliminating the need for making and preserving multiple hard copies.  (All duplicate releases must be carefully tracked.)           Note:  Two master files are required:  one unredacted master copy of all original
documents, and one redacted master copy of all original documents.

Scope and Parameters:  This project will be implemented for a two-year pilot period.  The parameters are:

 Trespass fires  costs are anticipated to exceed $100,000 and there is a high likelihood that the trespasser will be identified;
 Incidents resulting in fatality or serious personal injury (not necessarily limited to fire incidents);
 Incidents resulting in significant damage to personal property  documented potential defensive claims (three or more) from multiple property owners (not
necessarily limited to fire incidents);
 Escaped FS Rx fires resulting in private property damage.
 
General Requirements May Include:  

 Background/security clearances for all contractors and their employees;
 Training and pre-work meetings with FS personnel;
 Ability to scan documents and convert them to digital (pdf) on CD, DVD or external hard drive;
 Large format and wide format scanning abilities;
 Photo and color scanning abilities;
 Map scanning ability;
 File structure development (to include ability to locate specific documents and   
 ability to locate items filed in multiple files);
 Quality control  validation of scanning completion;
 On-site/mobile document imaging capabilities.

<ARCHDATE>05132010
<CONTACT>Mrs. Danyiele Peterson (757)322-8365
<DESC>The Department of Navy (DoN) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) at some future time for renewable energy generation opportunities on US Marine Corps installations located in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida:  Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, SC, Marines Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, SC, Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany, GA and Marine Corps Logistics Base Blount Island, FL.
DoN will provide Government land for renewable energy generation system, or systems, to be developed, constructed, owned, operated and maintained by a private entity. In order for the DoN to develop a succinct RFP, we seek to identify responsible sources and obtain information regarding renewable opportunities and risks associated with these specific installations and sites identified on the installations. The results of this Request for Information (RFI) will assist in developing a RFP to be issued at a later date.
Specifically, the DoN objectives are: 
-Maximize the land opportunity for the development of a renewable generation asset on the specific installation.-Provide energy security for the installation. -Reduce the amount of construction waste, biomass and Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) going to landfills.-Reduce the DON carbon footprint.-Maximize the financial benefits of the opportunity. -Purchase power and/or energy at a lower cost than current cost, as applicable. 
In order to meet these objectives, the DoN will consider the following opportunities: 
-On site power and/or steam production generated from renewable energy sources.-Production of "synthetic gas" to displace other fossil fuel purchases.-Production of liquid Bio-fuels and/or Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF).-Wholesale generation to the utility grid, with revenue sharing considerations. -Medium to long term arrangements for the purchase of power. -Distributed generation, including net metering or feed-in tariff arrangements. -A combination of the above. 
NOTE:  DoN is considering these opportunities as viable options; however, it is interested in determining whether there are other viable renewable energy alternatives at the locations.  Firms are encouraged to submit information for other renewable energy options at the locations.
This RFI is concerned with the following US Marine Corps bases in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida only.
Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, SCMarine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, SCMarine Corps Logistics Base Albany, SCMarine Corps Support Facility Blount Island, SC.
Information is made available providing characteristics of each site at the selected installation(s) with this RFI.

<DESC>The Pacific Region Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) Region 12 announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Sequential Compression Devices, Sleeves & Attachments.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the regions based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a clinically preferred product and source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense Prime Vendor Program. As a clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical criteria <BR>plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Selection will be based clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade-off criteria.<BR><BR>The major Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Pacific Region, TRBO Region 12 area include but are not limited to Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, MEDDAC-K Seoul, 374th Medical Group Yokota Air Base, 18th Medical Group Kadena Air Base. <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the program, Cardinal Health. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three one-year (12 months) option periods. Anticipated selection date is June 2010.  Products and vendors that pass the technical criteria and pass the clinical performance expectations will be considered clinically preferred products and sources.  Among these clinically preferred products and sources price will be the determining factor for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF clinical preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Mary Summers, TRBO Technical Director <BR>808-433-3686, mary.summers1@us.army.mil<BR><BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B. Products & Performance Required.  <BR>The Pacific Region is seeking product line items in the category of Sequential Compression Devices, Sleeves & Attachments which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below. Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $101,764.74. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. <BR><BR>The top 10 high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR>  <BR><BR>At the request of the Pacific Region MTFs, vendors will provide conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types, and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.  <BR><BR>C. Instructions to Vendors<BR>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to mary.summers1@us.army.mil  and cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. and (3) Identification of the RFQRIA to which the vendor is responding. Submissions must be received by 5:00 post meridiem (p.m.) Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating. <BR><BR>In a one step notification process, the Pacific Region TRBO will request responses to the technical/company criteria, no charge literature, no charge sample sets, and best available pricing from each interested vendor.  Vendors will have 30 calendar days to 1.)  respond to the Pacific Region TRBO  with their responses to the technical/company criteria and submission of best value price quotes; and 2.) deliver no charge literature and no charge sample sets to all participating MTFs.  No charge literature and no charge samples must be received by the participating MTFs by close of business (COB) 5:00 PM HST, 30 days after the date of request to supply samples.  All vendors must send the Pacific TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment. Vendor responses to the technical criteria must be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format that will be provided by the Pacific Region TRBO. Best value pricing must be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the total requirements of the Pacific Region. Vendors that fail to respond to the technical criteria, fail to provide a price quote or fail to deliver the no charge literature and no charge sample sets within the time prescribed will be disqualified from further consideration.  <BR>Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing by email at the conclusion of the process.<BR><BR>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical criteria listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Pacific Region. <BR>As this process will require vendors to submit certain information electronically, vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC (stated above) that their electronic submissions have arrived at the Regional TRBO.

However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  The Region reserves the right to reject all quotes and cancel the RFQRIA if it is determined to be in the governments best interest.<BR><BR>Price will be analyzed based on the vendors anticipated Post Standardization Costs. Post standardization costs will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the region. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post Standardization Cost at the current suppliers non-discounted price. Among the products and sources that are determined to be clinically preferred, the best price (Post Standardization Cost) will be the deciding factor. <BR><BR>D. Source Selection Procedures  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) for the Pacific Region is the governing bodies of the standardization process and program. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Pacific Region. The board is chaired by the Designated Senior Logistician (DSL). They are the deciding officials for this initiative. The Pacific Region TPRB is Co-Chaired by a physician from Naval Hospital Yokosuka and an Air Force Nurse Corps officer assigned to the Hawaii Multi-Service Marketing Management Office (MSMMO). The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussion. <BR><BR><BR> <BR>E. Technical  Criteria Evaluations<BR>The vendors responses to the technical criteria will be reviewed for acceptability.  Acceptability is defined as follows: 1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the vendor can meet the standard of each technical criterion; 2.) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community that are applicable to such products or services; and 3) the information provided by the vendor is factually correct.

Vendors must achieve an acceptable rating on their responses to the technical criteria for continued consideration in this initiative.  Vendors who do not achieve an acceptable rating will be disqualified.<BR><BR>F. Technical/Company Criteria<BR>The TPRB and CPTs consists of physicians, pharmacists, nurses, allied health professionals, and technicians from the Pacific Region MTFs. During the pre-source selection procedures, the TPRB and CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below.  <BR>1.Vendors must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of Sequential Compression Devices, Sleeves & Attachments. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum,   This product line includes but is not limited to the Compressor/Pump device w/hanger for bed or gurney; thigh sleeve/cuff, calf sleeve/cuff and foot sleeve/cuff; connecting compressor tubing which provides either single or duo limb compression. Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes/applications listed.<BR><BR>2. Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for  <BR>Sequential Compression Devices, Sleeves & Attachments.   Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application   process with the initial submittal. This information is to be provided in response to the Technical/Company Criteria worksheet provided to the vendor. <BR><BR>3. Vendors must have an agreement with the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor for the Pacific Region, Cardinal Healthcare. This information is to be provided in response to the Technical/Company Criteria worksheet provided to the vendor.<BR><BR>4.Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available. DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.<BR><BR>5.Vendors must provide latex free disposable single patient use compression sleeves/cuffs.<BR><BR>6.Vendors must provide latex free connecting tubing from the sleeves/cuffs to the compressor/pump. <BR><BR>7.Vendors must provide a visual LED display on the compressor/pump device which indicates pump function.<BR><BR>8.Vendors must provide an audible and visual alarm system on the compressor/pump.<BR><BR>9.Vendor, upon the award of the Regional Incentive Agreement for the Pacific Region, will provide the compressor/pumps, at no cost to the MTFs.  <BR><BR>10.Vendor, upon the award of the Regional Incentive Agreement for the Pacific Region,  will provide on site inservice support for the Medical Treatment Facilities in Hawaii and WESTPAC. Failure to provide this inservice direct support to the Pacific Region MTFs will result in disqualification.  <BR><BR><BR>G. Clinical Performance Evaluation:<BR>     In the pre-source selection procedures above, the TPRB and CPT members determined/approved that both product literature and sample sets are required for the evaluation in a clinical/pharmaceutical setting. Based on this determination, the following procedures apply. <BR><BR>The Pacific Region has previously experienced loss of sample devices and equipment, when shipping equipment and devices to the OCONUS facilities for evaluation purposes. To mitigate this risk, and decrease equipment losses for the competing vendors, the region has selected to have the largest MTF in the Pacific Region perform the actual clinical evaluations, and to have the Pacific Region TPRB  members utilize the scientific/academic process of peer review for the clinical outcome data (from TAMC), and the literature and empirical performance data from the vendors. The efficacy of this process is well defined by all professional disciplines and has been selected by the Pacific Region TPRB members and is supported by the DSL as a reasonable and appropriate option for this product group. <BR>The evaluation process will be an integration between these two activities:<BR>1.	The clinical patient evaluation experience which will be performed at Tripler Army Medical Center, Hawaii by the CPT members.  This is the largest tertiary care Medical Treatment Facility in the Pacific Region. The acceptable responding vendors will be at the site providing inservice guidance, for one week, with their respective devices and sleeves. The evaluation results will be collated by the TRBO and submitted to the TPRB members, Pacific Region for their review.<BR>2.	The literature and empirical scientific performance data, requested from each participating vendor, will have been distributed to both the Tripler Army Medical Centers CPT members and clinicians performing the onsite evaluation as well as the Pacific Region TRPB members. <BR>The Pacific Region TPRB members will review the literature and the empirical performance data, consider the clinical evaluation outcome data from Tripler Army Medical Center and submit their vote.<BR> <BR><BR><BR>3.	The TRBO office will request no-cost, sample sets from the vendors to be delivered directly to the participating MTF, Tripler Army Medical Center, Hawaii. Vendors will be given 30 calendar days to deliver the literature and samples for clinical evaluation and review.  Literature and product samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTFs by COB, 5:00PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST), 30 calendar days after the notice to ship. Vendors who do not meet the deadline to deliver the literature and product samples by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.<BR><BR>4.   All vendors must send the Pacific Region TRBO verification regarding the shipment of<BR>      literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment and tracking<BR>      numbers and the carrier used by the vendor. All literature and samples MUST be shipped  via    <BR>      FedEx or UPS or DHL.<BR><BR>5.  Vendors will provide the following samples:<BR>  a) Three (3) compressors with devices for hanging the compressors off the end of the <BR>	bed/gurney<BR>  b) Ten (10) thigh compression sleeves/cuffs<BR>  c) Ten (10) calf compression sleeves/cuffs<BR>  d) Ten (10) foot compression sleeves/cuffs<BR>  e) Thirty (30) pairs connecting tubing<BR><BR>       Failure to provide this defined product line will result in disqualification from the process.<BR><BR>6.    The CPT will evaluate each vendors literature and samples against the Clinical performance  <BR>       criteria in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted  <BR>       equally.  The clinical evaluation period will last three weeks and take place in a clinical setting. <BR>       The evaluation responses will be in a Likert type scale with a 1-5 scoring range. The scale  <BR>       descriptors are: One (1) = Strongly Disagree; Two (2) = Disagree; Three (3) = Neutral; <BR>       Four (4) =  Agree; and Five (5) = Strongly Agree. The CPT will send the completed evaluations <BR>       to the TRBO for data entry and analysis and the results will be forwarded to the TPRB for <BR>       review.  Clinical/performance evaluations will be tabulated by the Pacific Region TRBO, and <BR>       results will be forwarded to the Pacific Region TPRB members for final review.<BR><BR><BR>H.  Clinical/Performance Criteria:<BR>	<BR>1.	Inner lining of the sleeve/cuff is smooth, soft and nonabrasive to the patients skin. (Addresses Patient Safety and Comfort)<BR>a.	Patients skin integrity can be fragile and a rough material can be abrasive and scratch the skin  breaking the first defensive barrier of the body<BR>b.	This will be evaluated in a patient care setting<BR>c.	Evaluator will visually inspect patients skin and question patient  <BR><BR>2.

<DESC>Y -- SOURCES SOUGHT
<p>The U. S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set-aside an acquisition for Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business or Small Business concerns only. The estimated magnitude of this construction project is between $25,000,000.00 and $30,000,000.00. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 236210. The estimated time for completion is approximately 458 days. The solicitation, when issued, will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with the requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 for a competitive negotiated procurement utilizing the authorized Single-Phase Design-Build Best Value selection procedures of FAR 36.3. The acquisition is for the design and construction of a MPA Hangar at the Air Station Cape Cod, MA.</p>
<p>The project scope includes the construction of a hangar to shelter and maintain four MPA (HC-144A) aircraft at Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod (ASCC), MA. In addition to the administrative, operations, maintenance and personnel support facilities required to support the aircraft, the hangar will include new facilities for the ASCC Aviation Survival Technicians (AST). To allow flexibility in funding, the project is proposed to be implemented in phases to achieve full operations capability. Each of the phases will provide a complete and usable facility. The first phase provides all that is necessary to address the basic mission of sheltering and maintaining the aircraft and accommodating the needs of the AST. The second phase provides the operational and personnel support needs of the pilots and crew. This will greatly enhance the air station response time by consolidating their berthing and locker rooms in the same building that shelters the aircraft. The hanger is to be designed to eventually include the Communications and Command Center that is presently located in another building at the opposite end of the air station's campus. Sustainable design will be the standard. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver certification will be required.<br />At the present time, the acquisition is expected to be issued under full and open competition procedures. However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305 and FAR 19.14, if your firm is HUBZone or a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to Mrs. Donna Miller at donna.e.miller@uscg.mil. In your response, include a positive statement of your intention to submit an offer for this solicitation as a prime contractor, your Company DUNS number, your capability statement and your bonding capacity. Your response is requested by April 12, 2010. A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone Small Business Set-aside, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Small Business concern or on an unrestricted basis will be posted on FEDBIZOPS at www.fbo.gov.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis
<p>Air Force Material Command (AFMC) will be hosting the first annual Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (AF ISR) Industry Education Day on Tuesday, 4 May 2010. The event will be a classified, SECRET level forum held at the Advanced Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) auditorium, 2685 Hibiscus Way, Beavercreek, OH 45431. The intended audience for the event is primarily defense contractors and academia. Registration will begin at 0800 with activities convening at 0845.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Industry Education Day is to introduce the AF ISR Flight Plan and its associated capabilities based assessment (CBA) activities to industry and academia. The AF ISR Flight Plan is a long-term, integrated plan designed to develop cross-domain ISR capabilities to actualize the AF Global Integrated ISR Service Core Function (SCF) and the Battlespace Awareness Joint Capabilities Area. This continuous process, led by the Deputy Chief of Staff for ISR (HAF/A2), involves critical analysis, recommendations, and direction as the AF builds future Program Objective Memorandums (POMs) to address materiel and non-materiel capabilities in the near- mid- and far-terms. It also provides a mechanism for synchronization and integration during AF-wide modernization and recapitalization across all the AF SCFs. In addition, it provides both a deliberate process to influence annual programming guidance, and an agile, response to provide capabilities for warfighter-identified, quick-turn needs. The living nature of ISR Flight Plan collaborative automation tools and established community partnerships facilitate such quick reaction capability.</p>
<p>The forum will feature comments by Lt Gen Deptula, HAF/A2, as the key stakeholder and sponsor of the AF ISR Flight Plan. The event will also include briefings from representatives of HAF/A2, AF ISR Agency, and AFMC for the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Overview of the AF ISR Flight Plan process</p>
<p>2. Overview of the prioritized ISR capability Needs and Focus Areas</p>
<p>3. Overview of process to submit materiel and non-materiel concepts/solutions in response to the ISR Needs and Focus Areas</p>
<p>Unclassified Government briefing charts and Questions &amp; Answers will be posted to this FedBizOpp advertisement approximately two weeks after the Industry Education Day.</p>
<p>NOTE: This event does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement. This event does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, AFMC is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this event. All costs associated with attending this event will be solely at the responding party's expense.

<DESC>This synopsis is notification of the Federal System Integration Management (FEDSIM) intent to extend the period of performance under contract GS00T08AJC0009, with Darlington, Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of ITT Corporation, 2325 Charleston Regional Parkway, Charleston, SC 29492 utilizing the procedures of FAR Part 12. 

This action is required to extend day-to-day operational capacity as well as a 24/7 response capacity services for the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) due to a receipt of protest against the follow-on competitive award (GST0009AJ0015). As a result of the protest, a stay of performance is in place on the current award until GAO resolves the protest.

The day to day IT and Communications support is critical because it is a cornerstone and an enabling facet of OFDAs ability to respond immediately and robustly to disasters around the world, thus allowing USAID to successfully represent the U.S. Government during times of need. Disaster assistance, as provided through USAID/OFDA, is a key component of the U.S. foreign policy agenda. Any gaps in the provision of this ICT support would effectively shut down USAID/OFDAs ability to perform both disaster responses and to conduct its on-going operations, thus creating ripple effects around the world. OFDAs Information and Communications Technology (ICT) support is the essential foundation through which USAID/OFDA is able to respond on behalf of the U.S. Government, not only for disasters but for the continuation of daily operations such as programming funds to on-going disaster situations around the world. It is also the structure through which all communications occur both in and between Washington and OFDAs worldwide staff and counterparts. This includes the following mission critical components: twenty-four hour, seven day a week (24/7) network and user support; field communications equipment and technical officer support (deployed during a disaster response); all end user application deployment, development and maintenance; coordination and compliance with all USAID IT and security policies; and all necessary warehousing, lifecycle management and logistics support for OFDAs IT and communications equipment used for disaster response

As a result of this protest the Government stayed the performance of the awarded contract in accordance with 31 USC  3553.  On August 25, 2009 , A GAO outcome prediction was provided and FEDSIM pursue corrective action and allow for new proposals.  The Government issued a Notice of Corrective Action to all three Offerors on October 30, 2009 and issued Amendment 0002 to re- solicitation on November 4, 2009.  Final Proposals were received from the Offerors on November 23, 2009.

The existing contract expires March 31, 2010 and it is the governments intent to modify the existing contract to extend the period of performance, using one-month options, from April 1, 2010 through June 30, 2010. The extension will be performed under the same terms and conditions as the existing contract. The modification will be executed consistent with the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(2) and implemented by FAR 6.302-2, unusual and compelling urgency. Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirements would result in serious injury (including financial), if this contract action is not executed by March 31, 2009. The actions proposed within this announcement are justified. The government will support the proposed actions by written justification and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding.

Interested persons may identify their challenge to this sole source modification response by submitting capability statements that demonstrates the contractors experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the government. The statement shall include business size; ability to self-perform work; layers of subcontracting; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet these specific requirements. Statements should not exceed 5 pages in length. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this announcement. Contractors must have a current registration with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov and with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov . 

This notice of intent/synopsis is being issued for information purposes only and it is not a request for competitive proposals. Solicitation documents are not available and telephone inquiries will not be accepted. Written challenges may be directed to Chiara McDowell via email at chiara.mcdowell@gsa.gov. If no responsive challenges are received by March 30, 2010 the contract modification will be executed with Darlington, Inc. without further notice.

US Department of the InteriorSole Source Justification
Scope of Work - Matson's Laboratory
Title:  Cementum Age Analysis for Sea Otter & Walrus Teeth
Background/History:  The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Marine Mammals Management office collects walrus and sea otter teeth from subsistence harvested and beach cast animals.  Age analysis from the harvested segment of the population can provide important demographic parameters necessary for the successful conservation and management of the Service's trust species.  The Service has a long term tooth age data set dating back to the 1950's. Age determination (actually estimation) is interpretive - based upon expert interpretation of tissue structure.  There is an inherent reader bias in the process; therefore reader consistency is critically important to minimize inter-observer differences.   In order to reduce these biases, the same contractor must be used very year.  In order to maintain scientific integrity of this data set, the contractor must have extensive experience with cementum age analysis of sea otter and walrus teeth.
Scope:Using a microtome, section the root tip longitudinally, stain and mount to microscope slide.  Age walrus and sea otter tooth sections based on standardized cementum age analysis techniques.  For a description of standardized methods, see (Garlich-Miller et al. 1993, Fay et al. Matson 19811986, and Working Group 1 1993).  Each tooth should be read in 3 replicates with the median age returned as the final estimate.  
Deliverables:1.	Provide tooth sections mounted on slides.2.	Return unused tooth material. 3.	Provide an age estimate for each individual tooth by sample number.4.	Provide a certainty code for each tooth indicating how closely the cementun characteristics match those of the standardized ageing model for the species and tooth type.     5.	All data returned must be in a Microsoft Excell format.
Schedule:Services should be covered for a period of 5 years, beginning March 1. 2010.  Walrus teeth will be submitted once per year with approximately 150 - 300 teeth per batch.  Sea otter teeth will be submitted twice per year with approximately 150 - 200 teeth per batch.  Results should be returned within 12 months.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information to Solicit Interest Regarding NIAID Resource "Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics for Invasive Aspergillosis"
<SOLNBR>RFI-HHSN266200700023C
<RESPDATE>043010
<CONTACT>Alec Ritchie, Phone 301-402-8643, Fax 301-402-2508, Email aritchie@niaid.nih.gov
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI): To Solicit Interest Regarding NIAID Resource "Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics for Invasive Aspergillosis" 

Issued by:  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) (http://www.niaid.nih.gov)

Purpose:  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), will take procurement action in this matter.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, applications, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes only.  This RFI shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the government. Further, neither DHHS/NIH/NIAID nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.  

Responses will be accepted through April 30, 2010, and may be sent to the following email address:  aritchie@niaid.nih.gov.

NIAID is seeking interest from microbial diagnostic product developers in utilizing the NIAID-funded Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics for Invasive Aspergillosis contract (AsTeC). This resource was created to facilitate the delivery of contemporary diagnostics for invasive aspergillosis (IA). AsTeC can perform comparison studies between Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared tests for IA and experimental IA diagnostic tests for potential FDA clearance using a tissue repository of prospectively collected and archived clinical samples from patients at high risk for invasive aspergillosis and from subjects at high risk for IA with potentially interfering medical conditions. The repository will include sufficient samples from cases subsequently meeting established criteria for proven and probable aspergillosis.  http://www.astecdiagnostics.org/

Background:  Aspergillus accounts for the most deaths due to mould pathogens and is among the top 3 fungal killers in the world. The development of accurate diagnostics for Aspergillus is one of the most important needs in clinical mycology today. The primary goal of the AsTeC resource is to facilitate the comparison of new diagnostic tests for IA towards FDA clearance through this resource, as well as advance the field of contemporary clinical laboratory diagnostics for IA and improve the standard of care for patients at high risk of developing IA. The AsTeC (http://www.astecdiagnostics.org/members) has the capacity to replicate experimental IA diagnostic tests using samples from animal models of IA, the repository, or other clinical sample repositories to determine whether the experimental test performs at previously reported levels of specificity, sensitivity, and limit of detection as well as other parameters. The AsTeC will then perform evaluative studies using the clinical samples in GLP compliant AsTeC laboratories to compare the IA diagnostic test that has been replicated with an FDA-cleared IA diagnostic test. The AsTeC is not a commercial entity and strives to arrange intellectual property positions favorable to the third-party developer.

Information Requested:  Through this RFI, NIAID is inviting the scientific diagnostic product developers to express their level of interest in availing themselves of this NIAID-supported resource for testing third-party candidate diagnostic tests for IA.

Responses:  RFI responses must include: 1) Name of the primary point of contact for the response; 2) Academic faculty or business title; 3) Institution or organization affiliation; 4) Email address; 5) Phone; and 6) Identification of other key individuals who collaborated on the RFI response

The responses obtained to this RFI will aid the NIAID and AsTeC in maximizing the public health potential from this resource.

Disclaimer and Important Notes:  The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed. Information provided will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for the potential requirement and may lead to the development of a solicitation. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.

Any solicitation resulting from the analysis of information obtained will be announced to the public in Federal Business Opportunities in accordance with the FAR Part 5. However, responses to this notice will not be considered responses to a solicitation.

Confidentiality:  No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s). 

Inquiries:  Questions about this request for information may be directed to:

<SUBJECT>CONDUCT A COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN CENSUS IN THE US. VIRGIN ISLANDS
<SOLNBR>NFFN7600-10-07727
<RESPDATE>040210
<ARCHDATE>04052010
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to conduct a commercial fisherman census in the U.S. Virgin Islands for the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Services, Eastern Region Acquisition Division. The government intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Barbara Kojis in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. The government intends to issue fixed price contracts under the authority of FAR Part 13, 106-1(b) to conduct a commercial fisherman census in the U.S. Virgin Island. The performance period is from date of award through 18 consecutive months. <br />Justification: Dr. Barbara Kojis has a unique combination of scientific and practical fisheries management experience, particularly in the area of small-scale fisheries. Dr. Kojis was the director of the U.S. Virgin Islands' Division of Fish and Wildlife and member of the Caribbean Fishery Management Council for 10 years. As part of her director and council duties, she was not only responsible for developing and directing programs to foster the sustainable management of recreational and commercial fisheries but also became uniquely acquainted with small-scale fishermen management issues around the U.S. Caribbean.
<p>Dr. Kojis has been a principal investigator for a number research projects dealing with commercial fisheries management issues in the U.S. Virgin Islands. For example, she was part of team that examined the impact of trap fishing on coral reefs. More recently, Dr. Kojis was responsible for developing U.S.V.I.'s draft response fishery management plan to deal with lionfish.</p>
<p>Dr. Kojis was responsible for developing the first commercial fishermen census of the U.S. Virgin Islands (see, Kojis, 2004). Contracting with Dr. Kojis would ensure that the methodology and content of the survey is maintained which will make it easier to compare changes over time. Furthermore, as former direction and council member, Dr. Kojis has a unique understanding of the dynamics of the islands, which will provide unique insight into the evolution of the industry over the last seven years.</p>
<p>Dr. Kojis' work has been published in a variety of academic journals and books including the Environmental Biology of Fishes, Bulletin of Marine Science, Caribbean Journal of Science, Coral reef restoration handbook, Revista de Biologia Tropical, among others.<br />Dr. Kojis has considerable experience developing and executing surveys in the U.S. Virgin Islands. As noted above, she has developed and ran the first commercial fishermen census in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Maintaining this continuity would ensure that the final product is compatible with earlier efforts and would allow NOAA to have a common form across the U.S. Caribbean (i.e., Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands) when characterizing the industry and analyzing regulatory impacts.</p>
<p>Dr. Kojis is familiar with U.S. Virgin Islands fisheries. As former director of the local fisheries agency, she is well known by the industry. In addition, her survey team is made up of many former, local Fish and Wildlife staff, which is also very familiar with the local fishing industry in both St. Thomas and St. Croix. This familiarity and hands on experience with the industry, should reduce cost of the project since the team knows the industry participants and there is no need for special accommodations (e.g., hotels). These are important considerations the government will take into account when conducting a voluntary data collection.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses. However, all responses received within five days after date of publication of this notice may be considered by the government. Responses can be faxed to Sharon Walker at (816) 274-6983 or sent via email to shaorn.walker@noaa.gov. A determination by the government not to compete the acquisitions based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. DOC, Eastern Acquisition Division-Kansas City Office requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO LKE CORPORATION (DUNS 068597249) AS AUTHORIZED BY FAR 6.302-5(b)(4).<BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Northwest Division, Portland District, is working with the City of Portland, Bureau of Environmental Services to design and install an open bottom concrete arch culvert at the Buffalo Slough and NE 33rd ave location.  <BR>A feasibility study to improve fish and wildlife habitat for the Columbia Slough, a Section 1135 Restoration Project, was completed in July 2001.  The recommended action for the Buffalo Slough Reach is to improve hydrologic function at the site by removing an existing 48 inch diameter culvert, located under NE 33rd avenue, and replace it with a new culvert that would allow the reach to remain hydraulically connected at low water surface elevations.  The new open bottom culvert will allow unrestricted high and low flows and shall have a terrestrial animal passage incorporated into the design.   The re-contoured road prism will be re-vegetated with Native Riparian species.  Storm water treatment for the roadway will be accomplished by the installation of flow-through planter boxes.  New concrete sidewalks and bike lanes will be incorporated into the stream crossing.<BR>The site contains extensive municipal utilities.  A 10 gravity sewer line will be lowered for 450 linear feet requiring the installation of two new manholes.  A 12 pressure sewer, a water main, a gas line and numerous communication lines will have to be managed during the construction.  The contractor shall also be responsible for providing and implementing a comprehensive shoring plan and a de-watering plan, as well as a traffic management and safety plan.<BR>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENTThe VA Engineering Service for the Boston Healthcare System (BHS), Jamaica Plain (JP) Campus intends to 	Sole Source for to procure three months of Elevator Maintenance service, through Security Construction Services, Inc.  Security Construction Services, Inc. is the current vendor maintaining the elevators and working with vendors on the elevator modernization upgrade, for all 10 JP elevators. This award is to continue maintenance service for three months to complete an ongoing project to modernize and upgrade 10 elevators.FAR 6.302-1, USC 253(c) (1) Only One Responsible Source, will meet the agencies requirement and time constraint. 	 VA Engineering Service and the Contracting Officer believe this is the "Best Value" and in the best interest to the Government and the VA customer. 	JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION	1.  Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.	Engineering Service - VA BOSTON HEALTHCARE SYSTEM *2.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved.	Sole Source procurement of the following: ELEVATOR MAINTENACE FOR 10 CARS UNDERGOING CONSTRUCTION ON THE JAMAICA PLAIN CAMPUS*3.  Description of the supplies or services required to meet the      agency's needs (including the estimated value).	MAINTENACE OF ELEVAORS 1 THRU 10, BLDG 1, JP , Est.  $31,0155 FOR THREE MONTHS. 4.  Identification of the statutory authority permitting other    than full and open competition.	FAR 6.302-1, USC 253(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source,*5.  Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority sited. 	The recommended source is the construction contractor for the modernization of subject elevators Security Service Construction Services, Inc.  As such they are responsible for making changes to the elevator controls which will instruct the existing cars and the new cars how to respond to calls throughout the 15 floor building. The contractor's staff are already vetted with building passes, this can be a time consuming and possible costly endeavor for the Government.  The Period-of-performance is for three months from: 4/1/2010 through 6/30/2010. It is not cost effective and extremely time consuming, to expect a new vendor to come in on the project at this time, with all the changes that have taken place over the past year and expect that vendor to complete the installation of remaining parts and maintain the elevators while working with construction vendors in a period of three months. It is impractical if not impossible on these complex control systems to have multiple  contractors working on the control system at the same time for three reasons. 	They are:1.	Safety - As elevators are being modernized changes to control cabling, safety devices, and computer programming can be expected on a daily bases. The mechanics doing the work will be the only ones capable of providing the maintenance because they will be the only ones who know what parts of the work have been completed and which have not. Moreover as a significant part of the work will be in the elevator shaft unexpected movement of the counterweights, cab, cabling and control cables are a real risk to the workers. Having to independent contractors working in the same shaft is a real risk to the mechanics doing the work. The current contract does require work in the existing shaft which is not partitioned between cars.2.	Responsibility - If two contractors were allowed to work on the equipment at the same time the government could be certain, that significant disputes would arise about why a particular elevator or elevator function was not working properly. We can expect multiple complaints about what the other contractor did or did not do, what work was "intentionally sabotaged", etc. The complex nature of the elevator controls and safety issues require years of experience to analyze and repair. The government does not have anyone who would be capable of sorting out who caused what problems or which contractor was responsible for effecting repairs. 3.	Supervision - The work to renovate the elevators requires, that all elevators work together simultaneously to provide the best possible service to all the floors. In order to get the most of the existing elevators and minimize the impact of down time and breakdowns, that would affect the elevator service, construction and maintenance activities that affect the number of cars in service will need to be carefully coordinated. With two contractors working on the same banks of elevators we can expect that there will be conflicts as each contractor selects the time that best suits him to perform work on the elevators and possible lengthy delays. With a single contractor responsible for the maintenance, the VA will be able to minimize the overall impact on the VA, patients, and staff, making this time efficient and cost effect overall "Best Value" for the Government.  *6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are 	Solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a FEDBIZOPPS Daily notice was or will be published.	.7.  Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. The original prices on the first award were deemed fair and reasonable and the contractor has not changed their pricing for this three month award. 8.  Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names, of    Firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the     Results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not    conducted.  *9.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and 	open competition, such as an explanation why technical data            packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, 	statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for 	Full and open competition has not been developed or are not available.           VA Engineering Service believes that an elevator system like this one needs to be taken care of and modified by a single company so when there are problems a single source can be contacted for immediate correction.	The construction package envisioned a single contractor with responsibility for both the maintenance and construction activities and, accordingly, a service proposal was requested as part of the construction package. 	It was discovered at the time of the original solicitation that no one package could  be put together that could describe in advance how the construction contractor might affect the cars being maintained under this contract because the day to day work entailed will change depending on the issues that arise during construction. 	10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing,      an interest in the acquisition.*11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to       remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any         Subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services require	CERTIFICATIONI hereby certify that the data provided herein is complete and accurate to support other than full and open competition.___________________(signed)_________________________		3/26/10     		PETER A.

SECTION C- DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT

Background & Objectives

The overall purpose of this procurement, extending over the (3) years of the contract period (three base years with two one year options), is to support AHRQs Prevention/Care Management Portfolio in its work to build evidence and facilitate improvements in primary care, clinical preventive services, and care of chronic conditions related to:  1) clinical decision making; and 2) the application of primary care transformation principles, including care coordination, patient activation/self management support, the integration of health information technology in support of the goals of the Portfolio, and linkages between clinical practices and community-based/public health interventions for prevention and care of chronic conditions.  

Under  this Multiple Award IDIQ contract, the contractor(s) will establish a Prevention/Care Management Technical Assistance Center (PCM TAC).  It is anticipated that the PCM TAC will help build the Nations capacity for effective work in the prevention of disease and the provision of care for chronic conditions, with a special emphasis on improving primary care and building successful collaborations across the clinical services, public health, and community sectors. The PCM TAC will use multiple methods (including direct technical assistance, knowledge transfer, health communications strategy development, and dissemination of tools, resources, and research results) to maximize the benefit to health care systems, primary care practices, primary care clinicians and patients of investments made by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in prevention and care management research, dissemination, and implementation initiatives.


Statement of Work

The mission of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency and effectiveness of health care for all Americans.  In 2008, the Agency restructured its work within six portfolios including: Comparative Effectiveness; Health Information Technology; Innovation and Emerging Issues; Patient Safety; Prevention/Care Management; and Value.  

The mission of the Prevention/Care Management Portfolio is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of the delivery of evidence-based preventive services and chronic care management in ambulatory care settings.  The Prevention/Care Management Portfolio works to accomplish its mission through two strategic goals.  The strategic goals are based on the Expanded Care Model , a new model that includes population health promotion and enhanced community participation in the work of health system teams to improve clinical outcomes.  The Portfolios two strategic goals are:   

1.	Supporting clinical decision-making for preventive services through the generation of new knowledge, the synthesis of evidence, and the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based recommendations; and, 

2.	Supporting the evidence base for and implementation of activities to improve primary care and clinical outcomes through 
&#61607;	health care redesign; 
&#61607;	clinical-community linkages; 
&#61607;	self management support; 
&#61607;	integration of health information technology; and 
&#61607;	care coordination.  

These goals are accomplished through work in the areas of knowledge generation, knowledge synthesis and dissemination, and implementation and use of knowledge.  

Knowledge Generation

The Prevention/Care Management Portfolio funds grants to generate new knowledge about prevention and care management in areas including the care of patients with multiple chronic conditions and the transformation of primary care.  The Portfolio has funded exploratory grants in this area to help guide the appropriate prioritization, timing, and provision of therapeutic and preventive services in individuals with multiple chronic conditions. This work will improve the ability of clinicians, patients and policy makers to identify those interventions that provide the greatest benefit to patients with multiple conditions and help patients make informed decisions about health care choices.  Funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) through the Office of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services also supplement current efforts in this area.  

In addition, the Portfolio and AHRQ have identified the need for research that will identify, describe and disseminate the best methods for transforming the structure, characteristics and function of primary care so that practices can improve quality, reduce costs, and better satisfy the needs of patients and families. The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) has been proposed by a broad coalition of providers, employers, insurers and others as a model for improving primary care in the U.S., and numerous health care systems and medical groups are currently attempting to transform their primary care practices into PCMHs.  These attempts go beyond incremental quality improvement activities and aim toward whole practice redesign.  

AHRQ supports systematic studies of on-going, successful efforts to transform the delivery of primary care in the U.S.  This research will validate that healthcare quality, as reflected in quantifiable changes in process and outcome measures, has in fact improved subsequent to practice transformation into a PCMH, and will study in detail how the transformation occurred and its impact on costs of care and actual patient and provider experiences/satisfaction.  In addition, investigators will study the organizational and contextual factors within practices that have influenced the success of these efforts.  

Knowledge Synthesis & Dissemination 

The Portfolio fulfills AHRQs congressionally mandated role to convene the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to conduct scientific evidence reviews of a broad array of clinical preventive services (screening, counseling and preventive medication) and to develop recommendations for the health care community.  The Portfolio provides ongoing administrative, sceintific, technical, and dissemination support to the USPSTF, which is an independent panel of nationally renowned, non-federal experts in prevention and evidence-based medicine comprising primary care clinicians (e.g., internists, pediatricians, family physicians, gynecologists/obstetricians, nurses, and health behavior specialists) with strong science backgrounds. 

The USPSTF develops and releases evidence-based recommendations for the health care provider community to improve the delivery of appropriate preventive services in the clinical setting. The multi-year process of generating a recommendation begins with a solicitation of topic nominations through a Federal Register notice and consultation with stakeholders.  The USPSTF prioritizes nominated topics for review and for updating.  USPSTF recommendations are based on evidence reviews conducted by Evidence-based Practice Centers and in-house by AHRQ staff.

Portfolio staff have been working with the USPSTF to increase the transparency of its scientific and deliberative processes with the overarching goals of assuring integrity and fidelity of process and of aligning more closely with the processes developed by AHRQ for its Effective Healthcare Program.   AHRQ staff will continue and expand this work to include several opportunities for public comment on draft USPSTF products.  These efforts will be in coordination with final outcomes of current pending congressional legislation regarding the USPSTF.  

In 2009, the USPSTF released new recommendations for 12 clinical preventive services, and work was either initiated or continued on approximately 30 topics.  USPSTF recommendations provide one essential foundation for dissemination, implementation, and integration activities within the portfolio; however, the Portfolio supports the development of tools, materials and technical assistance to improve the delivery of evidence-based primary care.  For example, Portfolio staff created the electronic Preventive Services Selector tool (ePSS).  Available both as a Web-based tool and in PDA-downloadable form, the ePSS provides clinical decision support in user-friendly formats, allowing clinicians to search for USPSTF recommendations based on specific patient characteristics or to browse recommendations by topic. 

The Portfolio also supports work to create, enhance or evaluate health materials for use in primary care via electronic health records or other electronic tools.  Electronic health records (EHRs) have the capacity to deliver not only patient education materials, but also to be an educational tool for clinicians to use interactively with patients.  However, approximately one-third of American adults have limited health literacy. This means, for example, that they are unable to determine a proper dose of a medication based on an over-the-counter label. Limited health literacy can also affect comprehension of verbal communication. EHRs can include features that encourage clinicians to confirm patient understanding, such as a field that indicates patients comprehension level as well as anatomical drawing or interactive visuals that clinicians could use while educating patients about their condition. 

Implementation & Use of Knowledge

The Portfolio supports the development of tools, materials and technical assistance to facilitate health systems redesign in primary care settings. Focus areas include: health systems redesign, self management support; linking clinical practices with community resources; and, care coordination.    

Health Systems Redesign
In conjunction with the Agencys Health Information Technology (Health IT) Portfolio, the P/CM Portfolio supports primary care transformation through exploration of the model of the patient-centered medical home. Examples of this work include developing a public website on the patient-centered medical home aimed at policy makers and health service researchers and the creation of a foundational white paper on integrating mental health and primary care within the PCMH.  

Self Management Support
Self-management support programs are expected to reduce costly health crises and improve health outcomes for chronically ill patients with conditions such as asthma, cardiovascular disease, depression, diabetes, heart failure, and migraine headaches.  A successful self-management support program has the potential to change individuals behavior, improve health outcomes, decrease the burden of chronically ill patients on the health care system, and be a cornerstone of primary care transformation. However, many practicing primary care clinicians have not had the opportunity to develop skills in self-management support or the opportunity to implement this aspect of the Expanded Care Model in their work.  The Portfolio is producing multimedia resources for primary care clinicians to help them learn about self-management support, develop their self-management support skills and provide patients with self management guidance. This project will support both prevention and care management related goals, bridging the two parts of the Portfolio.   

The Portfolio will continue work with federal partners to help understand and test what electronic health record elements can assist in improving the consistent delivery and documentation of self management support. Two challenges related to self management support are what elements can be integrated into the EHR to help prompt and document self management support (e.g., goal setting, action planning, follow-up), and what key measure(s) should be collected from the electronic record to drive performance improvement.  In addition, this work will explore the development and use of personal health records to support self management. 
 
Linking Clinical Practices with Community Resources
The Portfolio supports work to develop the evidence base for and implementation of linkages between clinical practices and community/public health resources to promote healthy behaviors and prevent disease.  This work will build on a summit in 2008 AHRQ co-sponsored with the American Medical Association and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, aimed at encouraging collaboration, coordination, and integration among health care providers, institutions, and community resources. Participants examined successful partnerships at health system, community, and State levels, and identified strategies to overcome partnership barriers. In order to facilitate ongoing collaboration among summit participants and to disseminate their work to a larger audience, a special resource page was added to AHRQs Web-based Innovations Exchange (http://www.innovations.ahrq.gov).  Innovation profiles and tools from the Innovations Exchange collection address promoting healthy behaviors and linkages among health care delivery, public health, and community-based interventions. 

In 2010, AHRQ will host a second, national Summit involving stakeholders from public health, community services, and primary care.  The Portfolio will make additional investments to advance knowledge in this area.

Care Coordination
In 2009, in response to stakeholder input, AHRQ began an 18-month foundational phase in a long-term process to develop quality measures for care coordination in ambulatory primary care settings.  The work began with development of a measurement framework and a detailed, systematic review of potential existing measures.  In 2010, the first phase of this work will be completed and AHRQ may initiate the second planned phase of this workdeveloping and validating specifications for a small set of measures.  AHRQ has a goal of launching a measure dissemination initiative in 2011 or 2012.

Prevention/Care Management Technical Assistance Center
Under this IDIQ Multi award contract, the contractor(s) will establish a Prevention/Care Management Technical Assistance Center (PCM TAC),  It is anticipated that the PCM TAC will help build the Nations capacity for effective work in the prevention of disease and the provision of care for chronic conditions, with a special emphasis on improving primary care and building successful collaborations across the clinical services, public health, and community sectors. The PCM TAC will use multiple methods (including direct technical assistance, knowledge transfer, health communications strategy development, and dissemination of tools, resources, and research results) to maximize the benefit to health care systems, primary care practices, primary care clinicians and patients of investments made by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in prevention and care management research, dissemination, and implementation initiatives.

A general description of each domain follows.  Offerors should be aware that many projects assigned under specific task orders will draw across two or all three domains.  Therefore, it is imperative that the offeror has adequate expertise and skill in each domain and that the offeror can assure coordination and cooperation across divisions/departments within its own organization as well as with Subcontractors.  Examples of several projects that span the three domains also are described below. 

1.	Administration
This domain encompasses many activities associated with developing an operations plan for the Prevention/Care Management Portfolio.  The operations plan for the Portfolio will build on internal strategic planning, and will include: gathering input from external stakeholders regarding the strategy and direction of the Portfolio, and synthesizing and disseminating the work of the Portfolio through a comprehensive inventory and subsequent Annual Reports.  Dissemination may include multiple products designed and written for different audiences.

The Contractor(s) may be asked to coordinate numerous complex tasks across multiple organizations including other contractors, Federal agencies, grantees and national organizations.  

2.	Research &  Project Development
This domain represents a broad range of activities that will support AHRQ in conducting research and developing programs.  Examples of potential projects include, but are not limited to: 
  
a.	Providing direct technical assistance to groups and individuals, including: assisting with the development, management, and dissemination of public use data; and facilitating interdisciplinary quality improvement work in primary care organizations and settings

b.	Conducting formal external evaluations of programs, tools, and materials

c.	Conducting health services research that may involve both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, and that may require preparation of requests for approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and approval from relevant Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)

d.	Critically evaluating, synthesizing and organizing large volumes of information, which may include assessing and rating evidence from studies that vary widely in content and methodology

3.	Communications
This domain represents a broad range of activities and skills that focus on communicating the results of Portfolio work to multiple target audiences; engaging multiple stakeholders at various stages of the Portfolios work; and conducting educational opportunities for partners involved in Portfolio projects.  Potential audiences include primary care clinicians, policy makers, researchers and consumers/patients.  Examples of potential projects include, but are not limited to: 

a.	Providing specialized technical assistance in communications including: graphic elements and messaging; audience analysis and segmentation strategies; pre-testing of materials with multiple target audiences; and analysis of distribution (or communication) channels 

b.	Disseminating technical information to multiple audiences through multiple channels (print, electronic, etc.) 

c.	Developing and facilitating learning collaborations including: developing curricula; identifying faculty; developing teaching modules based on adult education techniques; assisting learner groups with strategic planning; and providing logistical support to each group such as creating and maintaining a shared Web portal, scheduling and conducting webinars, etc.  


Many task orders will describe a project that covers all 3 domains.  This is why it is essential that the Contractor(s) have extensive experience in each domain.  For example, the Contractor(s) may be asked to help the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force increase the transparency of its work.  This one project may include the following tasks: 

Administration: Creating the processes associated with posting draft USPSTF products and disposition tables.  Any new processes would have to take into account the roles of the USPSTF members, Evidence-based Practice Centers, official Partners to the USPSTF and AHRQ.  The Contractor(s) also could be asked to facilitate an open meeting of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.
Research: Based on information gathered from other transparency efforts, advising AHRQ on options for the design of the database and web forms for collecting public comments, managing the collection of public comments, providing scientific review and synthesis of public comments. This may include making recommendations to AHRQ Medical Officers on how draft documents should be revised to address the major themes/issues observed in the public comments and assisting the Medical Officers in the creation of disposition tables that provide information about how the comments were handled and addressed, or actually creating the disposition tables.  

Communication: Providing technical assistance regarding the design elements of and messaging for a web form for collecting comments from multiple stakeholders; creating a marketing plan to advertise the opportunity for public comment to multiple stakeholders; and advising AHRQ staff on how to display disposition tables and/or revisions to draft documents.  

Task order contract research conducted under federal auspices, and products and deliverables generated by such research, must meet a number of requirements, including those associated with compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and regulations governing research involving human subjects.  It is expected that the Contractor(s) will have expertise within the project team that they propose in response to an RFTO, and will not require additional support or technical assistance in fulfilling any such requirements.  

The Contractor(s) will be required to designate a point person or small team to assume responsibility for: meeting contract requirements; coordinating tasks and activities; assuring ongoing engagement of operational and quality improvement leadership; assuring quality control of task order deliverables; and maintaining effective communication with AHRQ staff through the period of performance of the master contract.  Additionally, Contractors will need to propose specific project leads for individual task orders.  The overall master contract lead and individual task order leads may or may not be the same individuals.
The Contractor(s) shall communicate with their task order officers on a regular basis (monthly/bimonthly/quarterly) by submitting progress reports and deliverables through AHRQs Research Reporting System (ARRS).  In addition, the Contractor(s) and task order officers are expected to meet by phone or in person at regular, specified intervals. The Contractor(s) shall communicate with other contractors in order to coordinate projects.  It is highly unlikely that any work assigned under a specific task order will require the Contractor to work completely independently of AHRQ. 

The Contractor(s) shall assist AHRQ staff in their monitoring and tracking responsibilities by assuring the timely submission of high-quality deliverables.  For each task order, progress reports and other deliverables must be submitted electronically at regular, specified intervals. 

SECTION D - PACKAGING AND MARKING

The contractor shall mark each delivery/deliverable with the Contractors Name; Contract and Task Order number; Item number; and quantity indicating partial, full or final shipment.  Note as appropriate on the face page of each deliverable, or on the binding, (1) one volume only, or (2) volume 1 of 2.

H.1	RELEASE AND USE AND COPYRIGHT OF DATA FIRST PRODUCED FROM WORK PERFORMED UNDER THIS CONTRACT

(a)  Release and Use  Data first produced in the performance of the Contract.  As permitted in FAR 52.227-17, the provisions of this Section H.1 shall apply to any release or use of data first produced in the performance of the Contract and any analysis, tools, methodologies, or recorded product based on such data. 

(b)  Release and Use  Requirements related to confidentiality and quality.  To ensure public trust in the confidentiality protections afforded participants in Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)-supported research, AHRQ requires and monitors compliance by its contractors with section 934(c) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c)), which states in part that 

No information, if the establishment or person supplying the information or described in it is identifiable, obtained in the course of activities undertaken or supported under this title, may be used for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was supplied unless such establishment or person has consented...to its use for such other purpose.  Such information may not be published or released in other form if the person who supplied the information or who is described in it is identifiable unless such person has consented...to its publication or release in other form.

In addition to this requirement, section 933(b)(1) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 299c-2(b)(1)) requires AHRQ to assure that statistics and analyses developed with Agency support are of high quality, comprehensive, timely, and adequately analyzed.  Accordingly --  

(1)  prior to the release or use of data based upon work performed under this Contract, the Contractor agrees to consult with the Project and Contract Officers regarding the proposed release or use.  AHRQ will, within 6 months of the receipt of any proposed publication, presentation, or any other disclosure of materials derived from information collected or produced for this contract, use best effort to review the proposed report, presentation, or other text to assure:

(A) Identifiable information is being used exclusively for the purpose(s) for which it was supplied or appropriate consents have been obtained; 
(B) The confidentiality promised to individuals and establishments supplying identifiable information or described in it is not violated; and 
(C)	The quality of statistical and analytical work meets the statutory standards cited above.

The Contractor will in good faith consider, discuss, and respond to any comments or suggested modifications that are provided by AHRQ within two months of receiving the proposed release or use.

(2)  The Contractor must satisfy conditions (1) (A) and (1) (B).  At the conclusion of any consultation required by paragraph (b) (1) above, if AHRQ and the Contractor cannot agree that a proposed use or release satisfies condition (1) (C) above:

(A)  	the research professional at the Contractor responsible for the quality of the Contract work will, in advance of any release or use of such data, certify in a letter to the Contracting Officer what differences of opinion cannot be resolved regarding the statutory standards referenced in condition (1) (C) and the basis for Contractor assertions that these standards have been met; and
 (B) 	The Contractor must print prominently on the release or other product, or on any portion that is released, or state prior to any oral presentation or release of such material, the following disclaimer:

THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT IS DERIVED FROM WORK SUPPORTED UNDER A CONTRACT WITH THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) (#   ).  HOWEVER, THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE AGENCY. 

(3)	If the AHRQ COTR does not provide written conditions or approvals by the end of the six month period following submission of a request to publish a report or to make a presentation or other disclosure of material derived from work performed for AHRQ-funded research, the Contractor may publish, present, or otherwise disclose this material subject to the restrictions of Section 903(c).  However, the Contractor must print prominently on the report or any portion of it which is released, or state prior to any oral or other disclosure of the material derived from work performed under this contract, the following disclaimer:

THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT IS DERIVED FROM WORK SUPPORTED UNDER A CONTRACT WITH THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) (#   ).  HOWEVER, THIS PRESENTATION/ PUBLICATION/OR OTHER PRODUCT HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE AGENCY. 

(c)  Required Statement Regarding Protected Information.  On all written material or other recorded products, or preceding any presentation or other oral disclosure, release or use of material based on identifiable information obtained in the course of work performed under this contract, the Contractor shall make the following statement:

IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ON WHICH THIS REPORT, PRESENTATION, OR OTHER FORM OF DISCLOSURE IS BASED IS PROTECTED BY FEDERAL LAW, SECTION 934(c) OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT, 42 U.S.C. 299c-3(c).  NO IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT ANY INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES SUPPLYING THE INFORMATION OR DESCRIBED IN IT MAY BE KNOWINGLY USED EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR PRIOR CONSENT.  ANY CONFIDENTIAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN THIS REPORT OR PRESENTATION THAT IS KNOWINGLY DISCLOSED IS DISCLOSED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT WAS PROVIDED. 

(d)  Copyright  Data first produced in the performance of the Contract.  Subject to the terms of this Section regarding release and use of data, AHRQ, through its Contract Specialist, will grant permission under FAR 52.227-17(c) (1) (i) to the Contractor to establish claim to copyright subsisting in scientific and technical articles based on or containing data first produced in the performance of this contract that are submitted for publication in academic, technical or professional journals, symposia proceedings or similar works.  When claim to copyright is made, the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship (including contract number) to the data when such data are delivered to the Government, as well as when the data are published or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright Office.  In such circumstances, the Contractor hereby agrees to grant to AHRQ, and others acting on its behalf, a paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license for all such data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of AHRQ.  A description of this license will be incorporated into the copyright notices required above.

(e)  Subcontracts.  Whenever data, analyses, or other recorded products are to be developed by a subcontractor under this Contract, the Contractor must include the terms of H.1 in the subcontract, without substantive alteration, with a provision that the subcontractor may not further assign to another party any of its obligations to the Contractor.  No clause may be included to diminish the Governments stated requirements or rights regarding release or use of products or materials based on data derived from work performed under this contract.

H.2	 LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH REQUIREMENTS FOR RELEASE OR USE

Failure to submit materials for statutorily mandated confidentiality and statistical and analytic quality reviews as required by Section H.1 of this contract will be viewed as a material violation and breach of the terms of this contract, as the requirements of this provision are necessary for AHRQ to carry out its statutory obligations and responsibilities.  Records of the Contractor's performance, including the Contractor's performance pertaining to this Contract, will be maintained in AHRQ's Contracts Management Office and will be considered as an element of past performance which is part of all subsequent competitive contract proposal reviews.  

H.3	SUBCONTRACTS

The contractor must include in any subcontracts executed or used to provide the support specified in this contract the terms of requirements H.1, H.2, H.3, and H.6.   These requirements are to be included without substantive alteration, and no clause may be included to diminish these requirements.

Award of any subcontract is subject to the written approval of the Contracting Officer upon review of the supporting documentation as required by FAR Clause 52.215-12, Subcontractor Cost or Pricing Data, of the General Clauses incorporated into this contract.  A copy of the signed subcontract shall be provided to the Contract Specialist.

H.4	LATE PAYMENTS TO THE GOVERNMENT

Late payment of debts owed the Government by the Contractor, arising from whatever cause, under this contract/order shall bear interest at a rate or rates to be established in accordance with the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual.  For purposes of this provision, late payments are defined as payments received by the Government more than 30 days after the Contractor has been notified in writing by the Contracting Officer of:

	a.	The basis of indebtedness.
	b.	The amount due.
	c.	The fact that interest will be applied if payment is not received within 30 days from the date of mailing of the notice.
	d.	The approximate interest rate that will be charged.

H.5	PRIVACY ACT

The Privacy Act clauses cited in Section I (FAR 52.224-1 and 52.224-2) are applicable to the consultant records kept by the Contractor for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

You are hereby notified that the Contractor and its employees are subject to criminal penalties for violations of the Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(i)) to the same extent as employees of the Department.  The Contractor shall assure that each Contractor employee is aware that he/she can be subjected to criminal penalties for violations of the Act.  Disposition instructions:  Records are to be destroyed after contract closeout is completed and final payment is made and in accordance with IRS regulations.
H.6  	SALARY RATE LIMITATION

Pursuant to the applicable Public Law cited in the table below, the Contractor shall not use contract funds to pay the direct salary of an individual at a rate in excess of the salary level in effect on the date the expense is incurred as shown in the table below.

For purposes of the salary limitation, the terms direct salary, salary, and institutional base salary have the same meaning and are collectively referred to as direct salary in this clause. An individual's direct salary is the annual compensation that the Contractor pays for an individual's appointment whether that individual's time is spent on research, teaching, patient care, or other activities. Direct salary excludes any income that an individual may be permitted to earn outside of duties to the Contractor.  Direct salary also excludes fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative expenses (also referred to as indirect costs or facilities and administrative [F&A] costs).

The salary rate limitation also applies to individuals performing under subcontracts.  However, it does not apply to fees paid to consultants.  If this is a multiple-year contract, it may be subject to unilateral modification by the Contracting Officer to ensure that an individual is not paid at a rate that exceeds the salary rate limitation provision established in the HHS appropriations act in effect when the expense is incurred regardless of the rate initially used to establish contract funding.

H.7	PRO-CHILDREN ACT of 1994

The Pro-Children Act of 1994, P.L. 103-227, imposes restrictions on smoking where certain federally funded childrens services are provided.  P.L. 103-227 states in pertinent part:

PHS strongly encourages all grant and contract recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and to promote the non-use of all tobacco products.  In addition, P.L. 103-227, the Pro-Children Act of 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities (or in some cases, any portion of a facility) in which regular or routine education, library, day care, health care or early childhood development services are provided to children.   
	
H.8	PROTEST

No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a Task Order under this contract except on grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract.

H.9	SECTION 508 COMPLIANCE
This language is applicable to Statements of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statements (PWS) generated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that require a contractor or consultant to (1) produce content in any format that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site; or (2) write, create or produce any communications materials intended for public or internal use; to include reports, documents, charts, posters, presentations (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) or video material that could be placed on a Department-owned or Department-funded Web site. 

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. This law helps to ensure that federal employees with disabilities have access to, and use of, the information and data they need to do their jobs. Furthermore, this law ensures that members of the public with disabilities have the ability to access government information and services. 

There are three regulations addressing the requirements detailed in Section 508. The Section 508 technical and functional standards are codified at 36 CFR Part 1194 and may be accessed through the Access Boards Web site at http://www.access-board.gov. The second regulation issued to implement Section 508 is the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). FAR Part 39.2 requires that agency acquisitions of Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) comply with the Access Boards standards. The entire FAR is found at Chapter 1 of the Code of Federal Register (CFR) Title 48, located at http://www.acquisition.gov. The FAR rule implementing Section 508 can be found at http://www.section508.gov. The third applicable regulation is the HHS Acquisition Regulation (HHSAR). 

Regardless of format, all Web content or communications materials produced for publication on or delivery via HHS Web sites - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. All contractors (including subcontractors 1) or consultants responsible for preparing or posting content intended for use on an HHS-funded or HHS-managed Web site must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and where applicable, those set forth in the referenced policy or standards documents below. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web-suitable content or communications material. 
1 - Prime contractors may enter into subcontracts in the performance of a Federal contract, but the prime remains obligated to deliver what is called for under the contract.

2.	Protection of sensitive information.  The Contractor shall ensure that sensitive information is protected by information security and privacy controls commensurate with the risk associated with the potential loss or compromise of this information.  For purposes of this contract, information is sensitive if the loss of confidentiality or integrity could be expected to have a serious, severe or catastrophic adverse effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.   Further, the loss of sensitive information confidentiality or integrity could: (i) cause a significant or severe degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the organization is unable to perform its primary functions or the effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in significant or major damage to organizational assets; (iii) result in significant or major financial loss; or (iv) result in significant, severe or catastrophic harm to individuals.

Personally identifiable information (PII) is a subset of sensitive information and is defined as data which can potentially be used to identify, locate, or contact an individual, or potentially reveal the activities, characteristics, or other details about a person.   PII shall receive a level of protection commensurate with the risk associated with the loss or compromise of sensitive information.

3.	Sensitive information on public systems.  The Contractor shall ensure that sensitive information is not stored, processed or transmitted on a publicly-available system (via the Internet) without the appropriate controls in place and specific authorization from the AHRQ Chief Information Officer (CIO).  

4.	Privacy requirements.  The Contractor shall conduct and maintain a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) as defined by Section 208 of the E-Government Act of 2002 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52-239-1, and required by HHS policy.  The PIA shall be completed in accordance with HHS PIA guidance.  Periodic reviews shall be conducted to determine if a major change to the system has occurred, and if a PIA update is subsequently required.  If it is determined that an update is necessary, the Contractor shall make the necessary changes to the PIA.

5.	The Contractor shall abide by all requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 and FAR Clause 52-239-1.  Pursuant to those requirements, the Contractor shall create and publish a System of Records Notice (SORN) in the Federal Register when required and shall publish an updated SORN following a major change to the system, as directed by OMB Memorandum (M) 03-22, OMB Guidance for Implementing the Privacy Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002, or subsequent replacement guidance. Annual requirements.  The Contractor shall be responsible for meeting ongoing information security and privacy system requirements.  These include, but are not limited to, performing annual system testing, completing an annual system self-assessment, and supporting quarterly and annual AHRQ FISMA reporting.  Additionally, AHRQ reserves the right to test or review the system security and privacy controls at any time.

6.	Electronic communication.  All Contractor staff that have access to and use of HHS electronic mail (e-mail) must identify themselves as contractors on all outgoing e-mail messages, including those sent in reply or forwarded to another user.  The Contractor shall ensure all contractor staff embed an e-mail signature ("AutoSignature") or an electronic business card ("V-card") within each electronic correspondence to automatically display "Contractor" in the signature.

7.	Clearances.  The Contractor shall ensure all staff has the required level of security clearance commensurate with the sensitivity of the information being stored, processed, transmitted or otherwise handled by the System or required to perform the work stipulated by the contract.  At the minimum, all Contractor staff shall be subjected to a Public Trust background check and be granted a Public Trust clearance before access to the System or other HHS resources is granted. 

8.	Non-Disclosure.  The Contractor shall not release, publish, or disclose agency information to unauthorized personnel, and shall protect such information in accordance with the provisions of the following laws and any other pertinent laws and regulations governing the confidentiality of sensitive information:
	
		 - 18 U.S.C. 641 (Criminal Code: Public Money, Property or Records)
		 - 18 U.S.C. 1905 (Criminal Code: Disclosure of Confidential Information)
		 - PL 96-511 (Paperwork Reduction Act)
	
The Contractor shall ensure that each contractor employee who may have access to agency information under this contract shall complete and sign the Commitment to Protect Non-Public Information - Contractor Agreement (Non-Disclosure Agreement).  A copy of each signed and witnessed Non-Disclosure Agreement shall be submitted to the COTR prior to performing any work under the contract.

H.11	OPTIONS

Pursuant to clause FAR 51.217-9 in section I, the Government may by unilateral contract modification, require the Contractor to perform any, all or none of the option periods of the Statement of Work as also defined in Section C of this contract.  If the Government exercises these options, notice must be given at least 30 days prior to the expiration date of this contract.

H.12 TASK ORDERS
All work required under this contract will be authorized through the issuance of task orders (TOs).  TOs may be issued at any time within the contract period.  

TOs may often vary in terms of content, cost and duration.  Task orders will normally be cost-reimbursement type contracts.  Task Orders may be negotiated and awarded on a cost reimbursement, firm fixed price or performance-based cost plus award fee basis.  By GAO rule, the set-aside provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.502-2(b) apply to competitions for task orders issued under multiple-award contracts.   Accordingly, when the need for a Task Order arises, the Government will first determine if it is possible to limit the competition to small businesses within the domain if there is a reasonable expectation of receiving offers from at least two capable, responsible small business concerns and if the award can be made at a fair market price.  Otherwise, it is anticipated that all contractors within the domain will be given the opportunity to compete for the Task Order.

TOs will average between an absolute Minimum of $25,000.00 and absolute Maximum of $25,000,000.00 and last between twelve (12) to twenty-four (24) months with an average being eighteen (18) months.  There may be circumstances where the duration of task orders may be longer or than the averages listed above.  

Task Order Officer (TOO) will be designated for each TO issued under this contract.  The TOO will function as principle technical liaison between the Contracting Officer and the Contractor's Project Manager.

 Procedures for Issuance of TOs

1.	The determination of award of the TO will be based on technical merit, past performance, cost, and any other relevant factors.
		
2.	When a TO is to be awarded, the Government will solicit proposals from awardees based on those factors mentioned above.  The TO Statement of Work will be sent to those selected awardees and a cost proposal and a brief discussion of technical approach shall be submitted within twenty (20) calendar days.  In unusual circumstances, contractors may be requested to reply within a shorter amount of time.  Oral proposals and streamlined procedures may be used in selecting the TO awardee

3.	Awardees need not be given an opportunity to be considered for a particular TO if the Contracting Officer determines that:

		A.	The Agency need for such supplies or services is of such urgency that providing such opportunity would result in unacceptable delays;

		B.	Only one such contractor is capable of providing such supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized;

		C.	The order should be issued on a sole-source in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all awardees were given a fair opportunity to be considered for the original order;

		D.	It is necessary to place an order to satisfy a minimum guarantee; or

			     E.	When the dollar value of the order is less than $3000.

4.	Each TO proposal will be subject to review and negotiation and will not be effective until signed by both parties.

		Required content of TO proposals will usually include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:

		--offeror's understanding of TO objectives;

	--proposed approach to solving the problem in terms of major steps or subtasks of the proposed study program;

		--types of final products anticipated;

	--proposed staff by name and percentage of time each individual will be assigned to the work; and

		--management plan for conducting the TO.

5.	The cost and fee for each TO will be negotiated based on the labor rates set forth in Section B - Supplies or Services and on other cost/fee issues.  

6.	Upon negotiation and agreement on the proposal submitted, the Contracting Officer shall issue for the signature of the Contractor a formal TO.  The Contractor shall not proceed with performance until the Contracting Officer has signed the TO and provided written approval to proceed.

7.	The Contractor's performance of the TO is subject to the terms and conditions in the contract, and the TO may be modified by the Contracting Officer and ONLY the Contracting Officer.

8.	Protests ARE NOT authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of a TO except for a protest on the ground that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract under which the order is issued.

9.	The Contractor is not required to compete for a particular TO if it chooses not to do so, i.e., the Contractor may elect not to submit a proposal on a particular TO.  Such election will not preclude the Contractor from an opportunity to submit proposals on future TOs.

10.       Requests for Task Orders will be issued by the Contracting Officer primarily
electronically through e-mail or internet but they can be issues by facsimile or mail. Contractors are required to have internet or external electronic mail capabilities. Some RFTOs will contain quick turn-around due dates. When an RFTO is issued, the Contractor shall provide a proposal containing both technical and cost price information for performing the required services.

K. 3         Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Dec 2008) 
(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals 
(A) Are __ are not ___ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(B) Have ___ have not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, state, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(C) Are ___ are not ___ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; 
(D) Have ___, have not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(ii) The Offeror has ___ has not ___, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 
(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a subsidiary, division, or business segment; and similar positions). 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. 
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. 
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offerors responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. 
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. 
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. 
(End of provision) 
K.4. PROHIBITION OF SEGREGATED FACILITIES
				(FEB 1999) (FAR 52.222-21) 

(a)	 "Segregated facilities," as used in this clause, means any waiting rooms, work areas, rest rooms and wash rooms, restaurants and other eating areas, time clocks, locker rooms and other storage or dressing areas, parking lots, drinking fountains, recreation or entertainment areas, transportation, and housing facilities provided for employees, that are segregated by explicit directive or are in fact segregated on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin because of written or oral policies or employee custom. The term does not include separate or single-user rest rooms or necessary dressing or sleeping areas provided to assure privacy between the sexes.

(b)	The Contractor agrees that it does not and will not maintain or provide for its employees any segregated facilities at any of its establishments, and that it does not and will not permit its employees to perform their services at any location under its control where segregated facilities are maintained.  The Contractor agrees that a breach of this clause is a violation of the Equal Opportunity clause in this contract.

III.	Additional Cost Accounting Standards Applicable to Existing Contracts

The offeror shall indicate below whether award of the contemplated contract would, in accordance with subparagraph (a)(3) of the Cost Accounting Standards clause, require a change in established cost accounting practices affecting existing contracts and subcontracts.

Public Law 103-227, also known as the Pro-Children Act of 1994 (Act), requires that smoking not be permitted in any portion of any indoor facility owned or leased or contracted for by an entity and used routinely or regularly for the provision of health, day care, early childhood development services, education or library services to children under the age of 18, if the services are funded by Federal programs either directly or through State or local governments, by Federal grant, contract, loan, or loan guarantee.  The law also applies to children's services that are provided in indoor facilities that are constructed, operated, or maintained with such federal funds.  The law does not apply to children's services provided in private residences; portions of facilities used for inpatient drug or alcohol treatment; service providers whose sole source of applicable Federal funds is Medicare or Medicaid; or facilities where WIC coupons are redeemed.  Failure to comply with the provisions of the law may result in the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of up to $1000 for each violation and/or the imposition of an administrative compliance order on the responsible entity.

By signing this certification, the offeror/contractor certifies that the submitted organization will comply with the requirements of the Act and will not allow smoking within any portion of any indoor facility used for the provision of services for children as defined by the Act.

The submitting organization agrees that it will require that the language of this certification be included in any subawards which contain provisions for children's services and that all subrecipients shall certify accordingly.

(1) 	Mark the title page with the following legend:
This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of -- or in connection with -- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Governments right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and
(2) 	Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:
Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.
(f) 	Contract award.
(1) 	The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.
(2)	The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Governments interest.
(3) 	The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.
(4) 	The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
(5) 	The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.
(6) 	The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Governments best interest to do so.
(7) 	Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
(8) 	The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
(9) 	If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.
(10) 	A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
(11) 	If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:
(i) 	The agencys evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offerors offer.
(ii)	 The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror.
(iii) 	The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.
(iv) 	A summary of the rationale for award.
(v) 	For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.
(vi) 	Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

L.9	GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

Introduction

The following instructions will establish the acceptable minimum 
requirements for the format and contents of proposals.  Special attention is directed to the requirements for technical and business proposals to be submitted in accordance with these instructions:     
         
	a.	Contract Type and General Provisions:  It is contemplated that an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity, task order type contract will be awarded.  In addition to the special provisions of this request for proposal (RFP), any resultant contract shall include the general clauses applicable to the selected offeror's organization and type of contract awarded.  Any additional clauses required by Public Law, Executive Order, or procurement regulations, in effect at the time of execution of the proposed contract, will be included.

	b.	Authorized Official and Submission of Proposal:  The proposal shall be signed by an official authorized to bind your (the offeror's) organization.  Your proposal shall be submitted in the number of copies, to the address, and marked as indicated in the cover letter of this solicitation.

(1) Technical Proposal; (2) Past Performance Information; (3) Small Business Participation Plan; and (4) Business Proposal.  Each of the parts shall be separate and complete in itself so that evaluation of one may be accomplished independently of, and concurrently with, evaluation of the other.  The technical proposal shall not contain reference to cost; however resources information, such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, etc., shall be contained in the technical proposal so that your understanding of the Statement of Work (SOW) may be evaluated.  It must disclose your technical approach in as much detail as possible, including, but not limited to, the requirements of the technical proposal instructions.

	d.	Evaluation of Proposals:  The Government will evaluate technical proposals in accordance with the criteria set forth in Section M, Evaluation/Award Criteria.

	e.	Rejection of Proposals:  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals received.  It is understood that your proposal will become part of the official contract file.

	f.	Unnecessarily Elaborate Proposals:  Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or other presentations beyond those sufficient to present a complete and effective proposal are not desired and may be construed as an indication of the offeror's lack of cost consciousness.  Elaborate art work, expensive visual and other presentation aids are neither necessary nor wanted. 

	g.	Privacy Act:  The Privacy Act of 1974 (Public Law (P.L.) 93-579) requires that a Federal agency advise each individual whom it asks to supply information:  1) the authority which authorized the solicitation; 2) whether disclosure is voluntary or mandatory; (3) the principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used; (4) the uses outside the agency which may be made of the information; and 4) the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.

		Therefore:

(1)	The Government is requesting the information called for in this RFP pursuant to the authority provided by Section 301(g) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended, and P.L. 92-218, as amended.

		(2)	Provisions of the information requested are entirely voluntary.  

		(3)	The collection of this information is for the purpose of conducting an accurate, fair, and adequate review prior to a discussion as to whether to award a contract.

		(4)	Failure to provide any or all of the requested information may result in a less than adequate review.

		(5)	The information provided by you may be routinely disclosed for the following purposes:

-to the cognizant audit agency and the General Accounting Officer for auditing;
			-to the Department of Justice as required for litigation;
			-to respond to Congressional inquiries; and 
	             	-to qualified experts, not within the definition of Department employees for opinions as a part of the review process.

		In addition, the Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-579, Section 7) requires that the following information be provided when individuals are requested to disclose their social security number.

Provision of the social security number is voluntary.  Social security numbers are requested for the purpose of accurate and efficient identification, referral, review and management of AHRQ contracting programs.  Authority for requesting this information is provided by Section 305 and Title IV of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.

	h.	The RFP does not commit the Government to pay any cost for the preparation and submission of a proposal.  It is also brought to your attention that the Contracting Officer is the only individual who can legally commit the Government to the expenditure of public funds in connection with this or any acquisition action.

The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial prices are fair and reasonable and that discussions are not necessary.

L.10	TECHNICAL PROPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS
To facilitate proposal evaluation, the Offeror shall submit, as part of the proposal, a separate section entitled Technical Proposal.  The data and information contained in the Technical Proposal shall be keyed to each paragraph of the technical proposal requirements as outlined in this section.  All pages must be numbered.

Recommended Technical Proposal Format

The offerors proposal should present sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the work requirements and a detailed plan for achieving the objectives of the scope of work.  Technical proposals shall not merely paraphrase the requirements of the Agencys scope of work or parts thereof, or use of phrases such as will comply or standard techniques will be employed.

This description shall include, at a minimum, the size of projects managed, start-up time required, number of projects managed, problems encountered, and the resolution of those problems.  Describe those projects currently managed.  Describe how the management experience of the proposed Project Director and the Project Managers equips them to manage a staff that reflects the diverse needs of the SOW.

4.  Concept for an RFTO, Technical Assistance to Support Research on Complex Patients

The Offeror shall submit a 5-7 page concept describing how they would respond to a potential task order as described below; the concept should describe how the Offeror would implement a two year project to start in the fall of 2010: 

&#61607;	Year 1: Offeror will establish a learning collaborative for approximately 50 researchers.  These researchers have been awarded either developmental grants (R21) or infrastructure grants (R24) to enhance understanding of how to optimize prevention and care management for complex patients (i.e., those patients with one or more chronic conditions).  One function of the learning collaborative will be to share study design, methodology and results among the researchers.  While united by the common theme of the complex patient, researchers  patient populations and methodological approaches may differ substantially, and they may be at different stages in their research (e.g., a subset will be just starting their studies, while a smaller subset will be just finishing their studies). The Offeror also will use the learning collaborative to help grantees comply with any reporting requirements under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The Offeror should assume that the grantees will be convened at least once a year in person, and the Offeror will collaborate on the agenda, meeting materials and will arrange logistics.     

&#61607;	 Year 2: The Offeror will provide direct technical assistance to a subset of grantees described above (Year 1) who have been awarded infrastructure grants.  Under this R24 grant opportunity, successful applicants will either develop a dataset or a new method for studying complex patients.  Grantees are required to ensure that the new datasets are publicly available for other researchers to use.  The Offeror will provide direct technical assistance to these researchers on creating a public use dataset (e.g., developing user manuals and codebooks to assist in creating datasets with de-identified data, and in posting datasets for public access [e.g., outside of the hosting institutions electronic firewalls] ).

This can include SDB (as prime contractor), joint ventures, teaming arrangements, and subcontracts.  Include the following information in SDB participation plans:

		1.	The extent of an offerors commitment to use SDB concerns.  Commitment should be as specific as possible, i.e., are subcontract arrangements already in place, letters of commitment, etc.  Enforceable commitments will be weighted more heavily than non-enforceable ones.
		
		2.	Specifically identify the SDB concerns with point of contact and phone number.
	
		3.	The complexity and variety of the work SDB concerns are to perform.
	
		4.	Realism for the use of SDB in the proposal.
	
	5.	Past performance of the Offeror in complying with subcontracting plans for SDB concerns.

B.	SDB participation information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which offerors relative rankings will be compared to assure the best value to the Government.  The Government will focus on information that demonstrates realistic commitments to use SDB concerns relative to the size and complexity of the acquisition under consideration.  The Government is not required to contact all references provided by the offeror.  Also, references other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government to obtain additional information that will be used in the evaluation of the offerors commitment to SDB participation.

All offerors except small businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan in accordance with the Small Business Subcontracting Plan, FAR 52.219-9, incorporated in this solicitation for any task orders that are estimated to be above $550,000.  The plan will only be required when a Request for Task Order Proposal is issued that is estimated to be above $550,000 and does not need to be submitted as part of this proposal.  A copy of a model subcontracting plan is available at http://www.hhs.gov/osdbu/read/SampleSubcontractingPlan.doc.  If the model plan is not used, all elements outlined must be addressed in the offerors format.  If the offeror is not a small business and fails to submit a subcontracting plan when requested by a specific RFTO, the offeror will be considered nonresponsive and their proposal will be returned without further consideration.

c.	If a subcontracting plan acceptable to the Contracting Officer is not negotiated within the time limits prescribed by the contracting activity and such failure arises out of causes within the control and with the fault or negligence of the offeror, the offeror shall be ineligible for award.  The Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing of the reasons for determining a subcontracting plan unacceptable early enough in the negotiation process to allow the Contractor to modify the plan within the time limits prescribed.

d.	Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting plans under previous contracts will be considered by the Contracting Officer in determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of the contract.

e.	It is the offerors responsibility to develop a satisfactory subcontracting plan with respect to small business concerns and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and women-owned small business concerns, and that each such aspect of the offerors plan will be judged independent of the other.

f.	The offeror will submit, as required by the Contracting Officer, subcontracting reports in accordance with the instructions thereon, and as further directed by the Contracting Officer.

SECTION M - EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD

TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA 

Selection of an offeror for contract award will be based on evaluation of proposals against four (4) factors and award will be made to that responsible offeror whose proposal offers the best value to the government.  The four factors are: (1) Technical Merit, (2) Past Performance, (3) Business Size, and (4) Cost. Following the evaluation, scores will be arrayed and a competitive range may be established.  Following evaluation and negotiations, should technical quality between Offerors be considered approximately the same, then cost may become the determining factor in award selection.  The Government reserves the right to make a best value award, cost and other factors considered.

All evaluation factors, other than cost or price, when combined are significantly more important than cost or price. The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective contractors in relation to the needs set forth in this solicitation.  The merits of each proposal will be evaluated carefully.  Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of this solicitation.  Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed criteria listed below. Offerors must possess, either in-house or through existing subcontracts, the capabilities to perform all of the different types of services sought through this contract.

THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MAKE AN AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSION.

B.	Management Plan							 20		

The proposal shall be evaluated on the overall plan for organizing and managing the task order contract.  The management plan will be evaluated on the appropriateness of the organizational structure and management systems, the management of subcontractors/consultants, the ability to handle multiple simultaneous tasks with 


competing needs, the ability to work with multiple agencies, the plan for ensuring availability of adequate staff, and the planned methods for assuring the successful completion of all tasks.  It also will be evaluated on the Offerors experience in complying with government regulations such as 508 compliance and OMB Clearance. 


C.	Key Personnel							  20	

The proposal shall be evaluated on the availability, qualifications and demonstrated experience of key personnel as identified in the technical proposal instructions.

D. 	Concept for Task Order 						  30

The following outline meets the minimum requirements of section 8(d) of the Small Business Act, as amended, and implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 19.7.  While this outline has been designed to be consistent with statutory and regulatory requirements, other formats of a subcontracting plan may be acceptable.  It is not intended to replace any existing corporate plan that is more extensive.  Failure to include the essential information of FAR Subpart 19.7 may be cause for either a delay in acceptance or the rejection of a bid or offer when a subcontracting plan is required.  SUBCONTRACT, as used in this clause, means any agreement (other than one involving an employer employee relationship) entered into by a Federal Government prime contractor or subcontractor calling for supplies or services required for performance of the contract or subcontract.  If assistance is needed to locate small business sources, contact the Office of Small and Disadvantage Business Utilization (OSDBU) at (202) 690-7300 or the OPDIV Small Business Specialist at ___________________.  Sources may also be obtained from SBAs PRONET website.  Please note that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has subcontracting goals of _30__% for small business (SB), _11_% for small disadvantaged business (SDB), _3__% for HubZone businesses (HUBZone), ___5__% for women-owned business (WOSB), __3__% for veteran-owned business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) concerns for fiscal year _____.

AHRQ PORTFOLIOS

The AHRQ portfolios are used to organize and prioritize research supported by the Agency. These portfolios have become the organizing framework for how Agency research is funded and how the products and findings of the research are disseminated.  Each portfolio has a portfolio team and team lead.  AHRQs Office of Communication and Knowledge transfer (OCKT) has organized its communication and dissemination activities by assigning strategic planners to work with each portfolio team.  Where appropriate, AHRQ Task Order Officers will coordinate AHRQ portfolio teams and OCKT's strategic planners to disseminate and market  Prevention/Care Management Technical Assistance Center (PCM-TACs) products and findings.
                                  Description of AHRQ Portfolios
Comparative Effectiveness
The mission of the comparative effectiveness portfolio is to provide health care decision makersincluding patients, clinicians, purchasers, and policymakerswith up-to-date, evidence-based information about their treatment options to make informed health care decisions. 
Health Information Technology
This portfolio aims to identify challenges to health information technology (IT) adoption and use, solutions and best practices for making health IT work, and tools that will help hospitals and clinicians successfully incorporate new health IT. Research supported by the portfolio aims to develop evidence and inform policy and practice on how health IT can improve the quality of American health care. Further portfolio goals include making the best evidence and consumer health information available electronically when and where it is needed, and developing secure and private electronic health records.
 Innovations/Emerging Issues
At this time, the Innovations and Emerging Issues Portfolio is being established and is expected to evolve in the coming months. The portfolio aims to identify and support research that has the potential to lead to significant advances in health care. Research and activities will reflect ideas substantially different from those already being pursued by AHRQ, and will constitute transformative research to solve pressing health care problems
Patient Safety
This portfolio aims to identify risks and hazards that lead to medical errors and find ways to prevent patient injury associated with delivery of health care. Important goals include: providing information on the scope and impact of medical errors, identifying the root causes of threats to patient safety, and examining effective ways to make system-level changes to help prevent errors. Disseminating and translating research findings and methods to reduce errors are also important. Additionally, the portfolio aims to develop an environment or culture within health care settings that encourages health professionals to share and report information about medical errors and ways to prevent them.
Prevention and Care Management
The mission of the prevention and care management portfolio is to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of the delivery of evidence-based preventive services and chronic care management in ambulatory care settings. Portfolio goals include: 1) supporting clinical decision making for preventive services through the generation of new knowledge, synthesis of evidence, and dissemination and implementation of evidence-based recommendations, and 2) developing the evidence base for and implementation of activities to improve primary care and clinical outcomes through health care redesign, clinical-community linkages, self management support, integration of health information technology, and care coordination.
Value
The goal of the value portfolio is to help assure that consumers and patients are served by health care organizations that reduce unnecessary costs (waste) while maintaining or improving quality. This is done by developing measures, data, evidence, tools, and strategies that health care organizations, systems, insurers, purchasers, and policymakers use to reduce unnecessary costs while maintaining or improving quality. Strategies include process redesign, leadership and management strategies, organizational and community-wide quality improvement initiatives, legal and regulatory changes, consumer choice, public reporting, incentives, and payment changes. Also, the portfolio conducts and supports methodological work and modeling to improve data and research, and to facilitate its use for policy and management.

Grass shall not be cut any lower than one and one-half (1 ) inches above the ground.  VAACC-Columbus reserves the right to request additional mowing services on an as needed basis.  After cutting, clippings shall be mulched or removed to the extent that no clippings shall be visible.  (NOTE:  The grass areas all have a sprinkler system installed)  It is the responsibility of the contractor to monitor the height of grass and to mow when necessary.

PLANTING, BEDS, MULCHING AND WEEDING:  All trees, shrubs, bushes and grasses shall be trimmed and pruned annually, and as deemed necessary by the VA.  Where these plants are immediately adjacent to each other, trimming shall be performed at such a frequency and extent that no branches from one plant shall be within the extent of a branch from another plant.  Once perennial plants have bloomed and subsequently died, any remaining leaves or stems shall be trimmed back in a way that allows the plant to return the following year.    All mulch beds shall be replenished so as to maintain a minimum of 2 of mulch at all locations.  All beds shall be weeded at least at every mowing but will also be necessary when required by VAACC-Columbus.

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested.  A written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued as a RFQ #Q5221100015.
The U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, located in Fort Oglethorpe, TN, has a requirement to cut and remove 218 hazardous trees throughout the park.  
This is a 100% small business set-aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561730 and the size standard is $7 million.  The Government intends to award a firm fixed price contract in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  
Statement of Services1. Project Site: Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, 3370 Lafayette Road, Ft. Oglethorpe, GA, 30742.2. Background:  Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park was established on August 19, 1890 "for the purpose of preserving and suitably marking for historical and professional military study the fields of some of the most remarkable maneuvers and most brilliant fighting in the war of the rebellion (26 Stat. 333)," specifically, portions of the ground of the Battle of Chickamauga (September 18-20, 1863) and the Battles for Chattanooga (November 23-25, 1863), the key engagement of the larger Civil War Campaign for Chattanooga, the Gateway to the Deep South.  Today, about 9,000 acres of those battlefields are preserved by the more than a dozen separate units of the National Military Park; 1,400 monuments, markers, tablets, and plaques memorialize those who fought here and explain the action. Most cannons are original cannon barrels, mounted on iron display carriages that help mark positions of artillery batteries in the battle. In most cases, the cannon displayed are the type used by the battery in the battle. 3.0 General Scope of Work: Work will include cutting/removing 218 hazardous trees throughout the Park, 240 hours of bucket truck work, with two operators, de-liming overhanging branches over Park roads, cleaning up stumps and other debris from the pit/bone yard with a dozer, dump trucks, etc.The park would also like to purchase (30) 40 yard dumpsters of wood chips, and delivered to the pit/bone yard. 3.1 Cutting/removing 200 hazardous trees: Hazardous trees are marked with a red mark on each tree that is to be cut down and removed from the park. All debris and limbs are to be cleaned up after felling of each tree and where large amount of saw dust exist, it is to be raked and spread uniformly on the ground. If debris or wood chips are on the roadway, then it is to be removed by blowing or manual methods. When the felling of tree process exists along road ways or near high visitation use areas, the area shall be barricaded off or traffic control is to be carried out according to State, and Federal traffic control standards.  Only one tree can be cut on the roadway at a time and completely cleaned up before moving on to another tree.The following are trees measurement, DBH and tree type, which are marked by the Park, that the contractor will be cutting and removing throughout the park.

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement. Procedures in FAR 13.106 are applicable to this procurement.  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors - a combination of price, a determination of responsibility; technically acceptable low bids and past performance.  For the technically acceptability factor Quoters must submit resumes with quote.  The resumes will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  A resume passes if the resume meets the qualifications stated above in the Performance Work Statement, Paragraph 2, Subfactors A thorugh E.  A resume fails if any one of the Paragraph 2, Subfactors A through E are not met.  
Quoters shall include Past Performance data as follows:  
The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ. Please submit price for services on a per month basis for each option period.  For example:  One year, $xx per Mo, Total of $XX.
Quoters are reminded to include a completed copy of 52.212-3 and its ALT I with quotes.  All clauses shall be incorporated by reference in the order.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. 52.212-5  Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive OrdersCommercial Items.  (a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). ___Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). (2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (Aug 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). (3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (Oct 2004) (Pub.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. 52.212-5  Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive OrdersCommercial Items.  (a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). ___Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). (2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (Aug 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). (3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (Oct 2004) (Pub.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br /><br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for the procurement of commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This requirement will be satisfied using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Parts 12 and 13. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed-price proposals for overhaul of the following items are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-10-Q-300037 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and this synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). When soliciting quotes or offers, round-off prices to the nearest U.S. dollar value.&nbsp;Evaluation factors for award will be based on Lowest Price Technically Acceptable quote. <br />The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-39. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336413. This requirement is posted as&nbsp;"Non Restricted" with regards to business size.
<p>This requirement is for the overhaul of : Ignition Vibrator, Part Number 10-111160-3, NIIN 00-706-2720, quantity of 5 each, to be overhauled in accordance with Air Force Technical Order 8E1-2-22-53. (OEM Cage Code is 59501)</p>
<p>The Coast Guard does not maintain nor release Air Force Technical Orders. This material has been designated as Flight Critical and a Certificate of Conformance is required for each item. The contractor must have access to all applicable technical orders and is responsible for obtaining the technical orders. Contract award for this requirement will not be delayed pending contractor registration or awaiting delivery of the overhaul directive. Overhaul pricing shall include all replacement parts. All replacement parts shall be new, OEM approved parts. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement. Drawings or specifications are not available and cannot be furnished by the government. As a minimum, the offeror (that is, the prime contractor) must possess a current Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification or an Original Equipment Manufacture (OEM) certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with its proposal/quote. Evidence of other certifications, such as a Department of Defense (DOD) Certification, may be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis. Subcontracting, as it pertains to repair or overhaul of the specified components, is limited to concerns in full possession of the required certifications and must be identified with the offer. Offerors are required to propose firm-fixed price for scrapping repairable which are determined "Beyond Economical Repair". Firm-fixed prices do not include components received that indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage. Components received in the above listed conditions will be handled on a case by case basis, after notification to the Contracting Officer of such condition. Within fifteen days of the determination, the Contractor shall submit a condition report for Unusually Damaged Items listing parts and labor required to accomplish the "over and above work". The contractor shall be entitled to the firm-fixed-price specified in the contract for overhaul and any amounts proposed for "over and aboves" will be negotiated separately. High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the overhaul directive will NOT be considered as reasons for "over and above" proposals and will not necessitate re-negotiation of the overhaul prices. Non-reworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose. Should any of the repairable be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions. The Contractor will be entitled to the flat scrap rate charge specified in the award document. Offerors' proposals are to include a delivery schedule. Delivery is required no later than 45 days after receipt of material. Accordingly, the contractor will be required to notify the Contracting Officer upon receipt of the repairable. Earlier deliveries are acceptable and desired at no additional cost to the Coast Guard. The USCG, ALC engineering department will make a determination on the acceptability of the DOD certification.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer Representative (COR) may issue a Contract Deficiency Report, Form MLCA(v)005-1. The Contractor shall respond in writing within 24 hours of receipt, unless otherwise approved the Contracting Officer, to the COR. The COR will comment on the contractors response and will forward the Deficiency Report and comments to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the contractor, MLC(vr), the NESU and Program Manager. The Contracting Officer will make the final response to the contractor in writing.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation.

Potential quoters who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below:

Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)

2100 Second Street, SW

Washington, D.C. 20593

Telephone (202)267-2285

FAX: (202)267-4011

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation and Notice of Intent. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Rocket Software, LLC, for a software license renewal for the Unidata software maintenance under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This will be in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Submit offers on HTC711-10-Q-D028. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24, dated 28 February 2008. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210 and the small business size is $25M.
<p>Rocket Software, LLC, is the only known supplier of UniData software maintenance as required by the Surface Cargo Systems Branch of HQ Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC), Global Freight Systems (GFM). The Unidata software is a proprietary product of Rocket Software. There are no similar products available through other companies that will satisfy the Government's requirement. This acquisition is for technical support for the Unidata. Unidata has been a critical COTS component of GFM since its start in the late 1980s. At the core of GFM are the UniData database engine and about 400,000 lines of UniBasic Software Lines of Code (SLOC). While GFM can operate in an extremely limited fashion without the presence of UniData and UniBasic, it would not be able to operate its core functionality. Based on the market research, no company other than Rocket Software can provide the necessary software products for the requirement. FOB Point is Destination, Scott AFB, IL.

It is not the responsibility of the Government to seek out and identify assumptions, conditions, or exceptions included within the Offerors Quote. Note that any assumptions, conditions, or exceptions made, may result in a determination that an Offeror is not technically acceptable, and may be excluded from competition.

<DESC><br />The purpose of this modification is to answer a bidder's question:<br /><br />Q. I was looking at the RFP and SOW for S5106A10R0004. I noticed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's a Nortel system that's being installed, so I know the type of system<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is already determined. My question is - how do you go about determining<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what type of system will be installed? Do you do thta via a bid process<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as well, or is the government exclusive with Nortel?<br /><br />A. We do not&nbsp; determine the equipment. On the SOW, we tell the requirement,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CENTREX if available, POTs lines, PRI with equipment, and make your<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; best offer to meet the requirement.

<DESC><br />DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Coast Guard intends to purchase "Open Secret Space Cabling" project/services for the Coast Guard. This Open Secret Space SIPRNET Infrastructure project should include 50 Quad STP Data Jacks and 3 Quad Fiber Optic Data Jacks as per attached schedule under Statement of Work. <br />This distance is approximately 250 feet. All other drops will be shorter as we proceed closer to the main distribution room. The layout of the drops can only be determined once ceiling tiles are opened and location decisions made after surveying best routing of data cables. The CG is flexible with determining final locations of all data drops.<br /><br />Additional Notes: <br />- No PDS is needed, but a cable tray support system is required<br />- No unclassified cabling will be installed per this SOW. It is possible the handling of some unclassified cabling will be required during installation of cable tray and/or STP/Fiber cables.<br />- It is possible for the crossing of JWICS, SIPRNET and NIPRNET cables to occur at differenct areas of project. So long as the TEMPEST requirements are met and adhered to this will not be an issue.<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Quad fiber optic WAO will need a dual gang box and face plate. <br />- The 3 quads fiber WAO, and the CAT6 STP will be of the same classification and can be installed in the same cable tray.<br />- The SMDR does not currently have the proper plywood backing for mounting hardware.<br />The plywood need to be 3/4inch thick fire rated plywood painted. These requirements will have to be met as they are all part of the FIPS EIA/TIA standards.<br />-Approxitmately, 30-50 STP/Fiber cables will need to be demo'ed after new installation is in place and cutover has occurred.<br />-Fiber WAO's will be terminated on double gang for each quad fiber optic cable. STP WAO's will be terminated with 4 CAT 6 STP cables on a single gang face plate.<br />- Secret clearance is required<br />- We would expect the contractor to install the labeled patch cables both fiber and copper. This will be a coordinated effort between the contractor and the customer during cutover period. <br />- - The fiber cable will be for MMF 62.5/125 and terminated with ST connectors. The CAT6 will be for a GIG network.<br />- All fiber connectors will be of the ST type.<br />- Fiber patch cables will need to be ST or ST: the fiber patch panels will need to interface ST to ST<br />

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is included.</p>
<p>Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<DESC>The Department of Justice, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, &amp; Explosives is issuing this Request for Information in response to a requirement for a new distribution service contract. The Government is only gathering information. The Government intends to work specifically with an 8(a) Alaskan Native Corporation Owned Company. The source sought is being issued as a requirement for market research.
<p>All interested sources that are 8(a) Alaskan Native Corporation Owned Companies are encouraged to submit their company and product literature, references, and other pertinent information for the Government's consideration. Below are the specific details the Government is requesting for the new distribution service contract. Companies capabilities statements must show that they will be able to meet or exceed the below specifics for consideration of a possible long term contract.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)</p>
<p>1.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) (hereinafter referred to as "ATF") is a law enforcement organization within the United States Department of Justice--dedicated to reducing violent crime and protecting the public. ATF performs the dual responsibilities of enforcing Federal criminal laws and regulating the firearms and explosives industries and is committed to working directly, and through partnerships, to investigate and reduce crime involving firearms and explosives.</p>
<p>ATF currently maintains a national distribution contract that encompasses uniform and equipment acquisition, distribution, and management services. The services provided help meet ATF's responsibilities under Federal law, regulation, and Executive Order relative to the mission stated above. It is structured to ensure that products and services deliver tangible and meaningful benefits, and that every economic or technological opportunity is taken advantage of as it relates to uniforms, investigative equipment, and personal protective equipment used by field personnel.</p>
<p><br />2.0 INTRODUCTION OF NEED</p>
<p>ATF contemplates entering in a potential $30 million distribution service contract, to include one (1) base year and four (4) optional years for the purchase, inventory management, and distribution of ATF- owned uniforms, investigative equipment, and personal protective equipment. Onsite customization of certain uniform items by screen printing and embroidery will also be required.</p>
<p>ATF has a requirement to provide basic duty uniforms, investigative equipment and personal protective equipment to its special agents, industry operations investigators (IOI), explosives enforcement officers, firearms enforcement officers, and other authorized users in an efficient and cost effective manner. It is expected that the service provider ("service provider" will refer to any person or business entity that submits a response to this SOW) will be responsible for the acquisition, storage, protection, and distribution of such uniform, investigative equipment, and personal protective equipment items. These duties will be executed in a manner that will provide superior customer service, logistical management of ATF-owned property, and minimal ATF administrative involvement.</p>
<p>3.0 SCOPE OF SERVICES</p>
<p>The national distribution service contract ATF seeks to enter encompasses the full range of uniform acquisition, distribution, and management services required to meet ATF's responsibilities under Federal legislation and executive orders.</p>
<p>Requirements under this contract include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Ready accessibility to a multitude of specialized products and manufacturers<br />Acquisition of approved orders<br />Automated tracking of approved orders<br />Receipt of such approved orders<br />Automated inventory management and stock accountability of such orders<br />Distribution of ATF-owned uniforms, investigative equipment, and personal protective equipment<br />Kitting and assembling (a process to create a customized kit of related items/materials that is assembled and shipped as one unit)<br />A secure, web-based application with multiple hosting options to facilitate funding and inventory accountability, particularly:</p>
<p>&bull; individual user accounts that can track individual purchases and allow for multiple funding mechanisms</p>
<p>&bull; the embedding of documents and videos necessary to provide sizing or kitting instructions and/or examples</p>
<p>&bull; forecasting and trend analysis to aid in funding allocations and equipment replacement schedules</p>
<p>&bull; reports that provide analyses of ordering/shipping times, fulfillment of orders, and types of equipment purchased, to include total purchase for previous years</p>
<p>The service provider is responsible for providing all necessary staff and having an existing infrastructure to support this distribution service contract, to include all supplies, materials, equipment, and a robust, online operational and logistical accountability tool. The distribution facility must meet all Federal, State, and local fire and safety requirements. Furthermore, the facility(s) must maintain a fire/intruder alarm system that is monitored 24 hours a day by an alarm company, fire department, and/or police department.</p>
<p>The service provider will be available Monday through Friday during core business hours (8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., EST). The service provider will provide a full-time project manager and an alternate for all work performed under this contract. The project manager will be accessible by phone 24 hours a day, and must return phone calls received from the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) or co-COTR within 1 hour.</p>
<p>The project manager will attend, participate in, and provide input to various meetings, briefings, and teleconferences with ATF representatives. The project manager may initiate teleconferences, especially when unusual or unexpected situations arise. All such communications must be initiated through ATF's COTR.</p>
<p>The service provider will be responsible for establishing a transition plan from the current distribution provider outlining the sequence of events and actions that need to be accomplished, without disruption of services. This sequence of events and actions include:</p>
<p>&bull; the procedures and any necessary resources for accomplishing each action</p>
<p>&bull; the period of time needed to accomplish each action</p>
<p>&bull; the scheduling of each action within the overall transition period</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp; how the service provider will coordinate each action and its overall transition efforts with ATF</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp; an approach for transitioning the inventory as well as the ATF data from the distribution management system of the current distribution provider</p>
<p>The service provider must have mechanisms in place to ensure quality control, to include:</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;audit procedures to identify areas adversely affecting contract performance</p>
<p>&bull; a problem identification and resolution process and a method for monitoring corrective action</p>
<p>&bull; a system for tracking incoming and outgoing orders and the timeliness of deliveries accomplished by both the service provider and vendors</p>
<p>&bull; a system for recording, computing, accumulating, maintaining, and providing access to data so that the service provider and ATF can use it for analysis and decision making</p>
<p>&bull; a method to monitor the accuracy and completeness of ATF data in the service provider's inventory management and distribution system</p>
<p>4.0 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>4.1 Order Receipt. The service provider will receive ATF orders via contractual vehicles using delivery orders issued by ATF's Acquisitions Branch.</p>
<p>4.2 Order Placement. The service provider will be responsible for all phases of order placement, i.e., source identification and price negotiation, and will procure those items as specified in the delivery order issued. The turnaround time on an acquisition from order placement to delivery will be 45 days or less.</p>
<p>4.2.1 Marketplace Changes. It is expected that the service provider will continuously assess and evaluate the uniform and equipment marketplace to ensure that the highest quality items are being purchased at the best possible price. Marketplace fluctuations affecting availability, quality, and/or price of items frequently procured must be reported to ATF, with or without an order having been placed, within 5 calendar days of learning of the change.</p>
<p>4.3 Order Tracking. The service provider will electronically model and track the flow of all apparel and non-apparel item orders, to include automated notifications to the purchaser of order completion. These orders will be tracked by individual user and/or by contract buying activities on such parameters as order status, individual request status, approvals and approval trail documentation by item and/or dollar amount, status updates, and tracking number used by the delivery service.</p>
<p>4.4 Order Delivery. In the absence of specific instructions, the service provider will choose a delivery method that will get the order to the customer as required, be it an ATF office or individual employee. The service provider will be responsible for all costs associated with the delivery. It is understood that such costs may pass to ATF in the cost of the item ordered. Bulk orders/stock purchases, kit assemblies, and/or products that require special handling and packaging will be received at the distribution facility. The service provider will receive, inspect, and accept all incoming shipments to the facility. For each order shipment, the service provider shall generate a listing of the products included in the order shipment. If all products are available for an order, the notification will list all requested products. Prepaid shipping labels will also be included, should a return be necessary. Expected customer receipt times following order fulfillment are as indicated:</p>
<p>Customer Receipt within: Priority Description</p>
<p>48 hours&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emergency</p>

The service provider will make necessary adjustments, to include expediting delivery, when circumstances beyond its control occur. <br />When shipments are returned undeliverable, the service provider will receive, resolve, and correct the problem address and resend the order within 3 business days. The service provider will also update the account system address. If an address cannot be corrected, the service provider will return the order to stock and will electronically update the inventory record.</p>
<p>4.4.2 Returns. There will be no additional charges for returns and/or exchanges of stocked items.</p>
<p>4.4.3 Repairs. The service provider will serve as the go-between on repairs to select investigative equipment, i.e., cameras. The mechanics for securing the services may be accomplished online or through a contractual vehicle, e.g., blanket service agreement.</p>
<p>4.5 Inventory Management. The service provider will perform inventory management activities to account for all orders placed, received, issued, and maintained. Products received at the distribution facility are considered inventory from the time of receipt by the service provider to the time they are issued to the delivery carrier. The service provider will assign and maintain stock locations/bin assignments for warehoused items as well as ensure accountability for that stock. Warehouses may vary by geographic location, and be permanent or temporary units.</p>
<p>4.5.1 Inventory and Distribution System. The service provider will provide real-time, continuous electronic access to a web-based application that facilitates funding and inventory accountability and supports ATF's distribution activities. It is understood that the capabilities of the system can be refined to fit the objectives of this contract. ATF expressly prohibits employee information being sold or provided to outside entities, vendors, and distributors. As such, the service provider will restrict access to the applications and data maintained in this system to properly authorized individuals performing the work under this contract. Those with access to ATF information should have background investigations and clearances to handle such information. The background investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of ATF's Personnel Security Branch (PSB), Office of Professional Responsibility and Security Operations. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to provide the necessary personnel suitability and security package in a timely manner, through the assigned COTR, to ATF's PSB so that a background investigation can be conducted. Any indication or belief that ATF information has been compromised will immediately be reported to the Chief, Special Operations Division. The service provider will also advise and document any changes to the applications. The service provider will safeguard data and not release or offer data without express written authority from ATF.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - CMS intends to award a Task Order under its contract HHSM-500-2010-00001I for Chronic Care Warehouse (CCW) Enhancement to Support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER). The purpose of this Task Order is to enhance the Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW) and continue to operate the Research Data Distribution Center (RDDC) to support Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER). These enhancements will enable CCW to provide a unique data resource to support CER. It will support longitudinal analysis of Medicare data from 1999 through present, link data across the continuum of care, be representative of the full Medicare population, and provide a large enough data set to support the study of small populations and relatively rare events. The Data enhancements will require the acquisition of additional hardware and software to have the capability of supporting this larger data warehouse. This will double the size of the Medicare population data in the CCW database and add ten years of dual eligible (Medicare/Medicaid) beneficiaries data to the database. In addition, the contractor will add other data sources to the Medicare administrative data in order to support a broad range of comparative effective projects. It is anticipated that by using a very large administrative claims database and by mining ten years of Medicare/Medicaid utilization data, information can be obtained faster that highlights what works in health care. This information can be used to develop practice guidelines and other methods to promote informed health care decision making. In addition to the CER enhancements, this Task Order includes the purchase of National Death Index data from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). CMS has an application with NCHS to obtain this data. The contractor will be responsible for incorporating the data into the database for CER projects. The period of performance is twenty-four months.

<p>GSA announces an opportunity for a VETERAN OWNED SMALL BUSINESS with management experience in the design, construction, and commissioning of large, complex, modernization projects to provide professional Commissioning Agent (CxA) Services for design stage, construction stage, and post-construction stage commissioning of the Modernization of the Byron G. Rogers U.S. Federal Building. Award of the Commissioning Agent (CxA) Services Contract is anticipated for December 2009. Anticipated start date for construction is on or about February 1, 2010. The current estimated contract value is between $1,500,000 and $2,500,000. The estimated Design Build contract is estimated at $100,000,000 to $125,000,000. The estimated project duration (design and construction) is approximately 48 months after Notice to Proceed (NTP).</p>
<p>This high performance green building project will continue the legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation through the preservation and modernization of a historic federal building. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program commissions our nation's most talented architects, engineers, landscape architects, and interior designers to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 - 100 years of service. GSA Design Excellence projects demonstrate the merit of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs, aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give public expression to our democratic values.</p>
<p>As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). All GSA projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific credits required. Projects in or affecting historic properties must comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. This facility must be designed in metric units.</p>
<p>The design and construction of this project will be delivered through the Design-Build delivery method under separate contract.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The project consists of a major modernization upgrade project for the Byron G. Rogers Federal Office Building (FB) and a window replacement project for the adjacent Byron G. Rogers U.S. Courthouse. This work is performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The FB occupies a prominent position in the Federal District of downtown Denver. It is an existing multi-tenant professional office building with 18 stories and a basement. The FB contains 494,156 gross square feet (GSF), 437,551 rentable square feet (RSF), and 329,433 usable square feet (USF). The current FB tenants will be relocated prior to the start of the modernization project. Agencies to be located in the federal building will be the Commission on Civil Rights, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice, Social Security Administration, and the General Services Administration.<br />The courthouse is a multi-tenant office and court building. It is five stories high with a basement and subbasement connected to the FB by a two story section. This section contains building services, a loading dock, and a two lane ramp to the parking garage. The courthouse houses six major tenants including United States District Court, Court Administrative Support Center, Probation and Pre-Trial Services, U.S. 10th Circuit Library, 10th Circuit Mediation and the United States Marshals Service. The building is approximately 248,000 GSF including two levels of underground parking spaces within the basement and sub-basement. A comprehensive modernization project for the courthouse was completed in 2005. The courthouse will remain occupied while the windows are replaced. The federal building and courthouse are located at 1961 Stout Street, Denver, Colorado, 80294. Both buildings are long-term GSA-held assets situated in a prime location near downtown with public transportation within the central business district, in the Federal District of downtown Denver, with a stable tenant base and a high reinvestment need.</p>
<p>Project goals and objectives for the federal building are to provide a pleasant, secure, and safe environment for the staff and visitors consistent with guidelines for Federal facilities and specifically the GSA PBS P-100; satisfy current and projected special-use needs, and allow for future expansion of these requirements; design facilities compatible with the tenants' existing character and local context, and present a positive image of U.S. Government facilities; use the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System, which is the nationally accepted benchmark for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance green buildings. GSA requires all new construction, renovation, and modernization projects to be certified through the LEED program; owing to the historic significance of the building, all work will follow the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Illustrated Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings, Revised 1992 (36 CFR 67); upgrade the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; upgrade the mechanical piping, heating, and hot water systems; upgrade the electrical system and install new telecommunications infrastructure; modernize all elevators; remove all asbestos containing materials (ACMs); implement GSA's workplace procedures and achieve measurable effectiveness results; identify design strategies that work to optimize the project's access to energy from seasonal solar, natural lighting, and wind to reduce undesirable loads and maximize desirable loads to meet desired energy targets for the facility; upgrade by replacing all public and private restrooms, plumbing systems, and fixtures; upgrade building security; replace underground water and waste water service lines.</p>

<p>PROCUREMENT STRATEGY</p>
<p>The General Services Administration intends to award a firm-fixed price Contract based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)&nbsp;Subpart 36.3, Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. The contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include phase-two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 36.303. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require contractor interviews/presentations at the Denver Federal Center, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT

The Marine Corps Systems Command is seeking potential sources for production and delivery of approximately three thousand (3,000) MK1077 Flatracks (NSN 3990-01-537-1045).  The Marine Corps uses flatracks to facilitate the loading, unloading, and carrying of cargo. The MK1077 flatrack is a 20-foot by 8-foot welded steel flat cargo body with a front wall equipped with a lifting point. Originally procured for use with the Army Palletized Load System (PLS), it is compatible with the LVS MK18A1 RBU. It is equipped with ISO locks, sideboard kits and tie down fasteners to facilitate the movement of break-bulk materials and ISO containers. A fully loaded flatrack can be self-loaded and self-offload by an LVS MK18A1 without the aid of additional material handling equipment and by an LVS MK18 equipped with container lifting and loading chains. The MK1077 flatrack is also used with the LVSR MKR18 Cargo Variant.

<DESC>RFI VA798-10-RI-0068 Questions and Answers, 1 through 12.Question 1:Is there any leeway for [an interested party] to submit a late response?If not, will this be a Full and Open competition wherein we could still be competitive though we will not have responded to the call for responses to the governments RFI?Answer 1:Late responses to RFI VA798-10-RI-0068 will not be accepted.  The competition method for this requirement has yet to be determined and possible participation in this requirement is not contingent upon responding to RFI VA798-10-RI-0068.*****Question 2:I am seeing that the reply date has been extended to March 31, 2010 and the Pre-Solicitation Conference has been moved out to April 20-21, 2010.  Do you anticipate answering questions between now and March 31, 2010?If not, we may just go head and submit our response?  Answer 2:We will answer questions via amendment to RFI VA798-10-RI-0068 between the issuance of the RFI and the RFI response due date and time of March 31, 2010 (3:00PM EST).*****Question 3:It is mentioned that the Industry Day will include demonstrating our capabilities in that area.  If able, can you discuss how the government will like to have these demonstrations take form?Answer 3:Please see question 10.*****Question 4:I was wondering if it would be possible to attend the pre-solicitation conference to listen and gain some perspective on what is out there and maybe see if we can garner any ideas on how to improve our processes as well?Answer 4:More information about the conference location, times, and registration will be issued via amendment to RFI VA798-10-RI-0068.*****Question 5:Where is the potential place of performance for this effort?Answer 5:The potential place of performance for this effort is To Be Determined (TBD).*****Question 6:With the latest modification under Fed Biz Opps, I'm trying to clarify how much information you are asking for by Monday?As a sources sought notice are you looking for us to express interest as a bidder and learn more about your requirements during a Conference planned the first week of April, or are you seeking a lengthy document for review and consideration?Answer 6:RFI VA798-10-RI-0068 is a sources sought notice and describes the VA's requirement.  The capability statement should be no longer than 10 pages, see RFI VA798-10-RI-0068 for details on capability statement format.*****Question 7:Who is there an incumbent vendor that provides these services currently?Or is this a completely new requirement?Answer 7:There is no incumbent for this requirement.  This is a new requirement.*****Question 8:Is a response required to be included in the Vendor conference?If so, is there a way that we could be granted an extension to 3/26?Answer 8:A response to RFI VA798-10-RI-0068 is not required to be able to attend the market research conference.  The response date and time have been extended to March 31, 2010 (3:00PM EST) via previous amendment.*****Question 9:Does the two areas below translate to the need to provide a "cost estimate" for the respective RFI areas in the response as well?1. The VA Enterprise Supply (Value) Chain Assessment is important so that all areas of potential non-compliance are identified, documented, and priced. The contractors' implementation methodology will provide best industry practices for the following services:(a) A recommendation for the most efficient organization and methodology for the operation of the VA Medical Surgical products and Prosthetics devices supply chains.(b) A recommendation for world class transformation methodologies, including but not limited to, the equipment, software, firmware and hardware required to facilitate VA enterprise supply chain management.(c) A recommendation for the Professional enterprise supply chain management "back office" support.(d) A recommendation for providing data analytics of VA enterprise procurement data.(e) A recommendation for the methodology for conducting product and data standardization.(f) A recommendation for establishing, updating and optimize the VA's E-Catalog.2. Respondents shall not be obligated to provide the services described herein and it is understood by the United States Government that any cost estimates provided as a result of this RFI are "best" estimates only.Answer 9:Respondents are not obligated to provide cost estimates in response to RFI VA798-10-RI-0068.*****Question 10:It is mentioned that the Industry Day will include demonstrating our capabilities in that area.  If able, can you discuss how the government will like to have these demonstrations take form?Answer 10:Per RFI VA798-10-RI-0068 "The conference will give contractors the opportunity to present their latest approaches to Enterprise Healthcare Supply (Value) Chain Management."  Format would be a general capability presentation.*****Question 11:While I realize that this Sources Sought Notice is for the purpose of collecting Capabilities Statements, I was hoping to find out if the outlined required work is currently being performed by an incumbent contract or if this a new requirement that may be procured at some point in the future.  If there is an incumbent, I was hoping to learn the name of the incumbent contractor, the contract number, the expiration date, and the total value of the contract, including any and all options.Answer 11:There is no incumbent.*****Question 12:Is a response to this RFI a prerequisite for future participation?  Is it necessary to establish a team for this response for those areas we do not have expertise or will the government recommend teaming partners after you have reviewed the responses?Answer 12:Possible participation in this requirement is not contingent upon responding to RFI VA798-10-RI-0068.  Establishing a team to respond to RFI VA798-10-RI-0068 is a business decision that interested parties will need to make of their own accord.*****

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management has utilized recently awarded BPA L10PB00476 and awarded the subject requirement to Premier Data Services.  Below is a description of the requirement.
The Bureau of Land Management has been compiling survey information and GPS positions to accurately portray the Public Land Survey System in support of parcel based recording, analysis and display of geographic information.  This information called the Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB), however, has been assembled in a series of ASCII flat files and need to be converted to a GIS format to support stakeholders and customers for the information.  The Western Governors Association has recognized GCDB as the best hope of standardizing cadastral information in the West in support of livable communities as well as economic development.  In order to make GCDB a more accessible and useable product, it is being converted to the GIS format used by BLM.  This task will improve GCDB data in designated priority areas and improve topological integrity and attribution of the data.  The vendor shall complete this conversion process for the BLM on approximately 1603 townships.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management is utilizing blanket purchase agreement L10PB00578 to award the subject requirement.  Below are the details of the requirement.
The BLM maintains thousands of historic vital records of public land ownership in Idaho. These records contain copies of original documents that have been microfilmed and are currently stored as a collection of microfilm aperture cards referred to as Control Document Index (CDI) Cards and roll film as 35MM undetached film. The BLM, Idaho State Office has only one set of these aging microfilm aperture cards that are cumbersome to research and are not backed up in a digital format. The cards contain images of records that date back to the mid-1800s and include copies of patents and deeds that convey title of public lands to and from the United States. 
The purpose of this project is to scan up to 220,000 land status records from these micro-graphic copies of legal documents mounted on aperture cards and approximately 30,000 35MM roll film to electronic format.  This project will enable the BLM to more efficiently evaluate right of way applications and permits for renewable energy or other projects in a more efficient and timely manner; thereby saving the public and the BLM time in the land use application process.  This will also improve the automation and quality assurance of BLMs current land status information.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br/>FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br/>CMO #09-555<br/><br/><br/>1.  Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army TACOM Contracting Center, Rock Island, IL 61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:  This action will result in a Firm Fixed Price contract with General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products, Inc. (GDATP).  Award is projected for the fourth (4th) quarter of FY09.  This procurement will be funded by Army Working Capital Fund (AWCF) sources.  An acquisition plan is not required because it does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan.  <br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The Government's current requirement is for fifteen (15) each GAU-19 Machine Guns without Barrels, NSN: 1005-01-560-2160, P/N: 10055418.  The estimated value is $ 1,250,000.00.  The proposed contract will include a 100% option at an estimated dollar value of $ 1,500,000.00.  This will result in a total quantity of 30 each at a total estimated dollar value of $ 2,750,000.00.<br/><br/>4.  Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304(c)(1), only one Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements as implemented by FAR 6.302 1.<br/><br/> <br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  As authorized by FAR 6.302 1, procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary because a competitive Technical Data Package (TDP) is not available.  GDATP is the original designer and manufacturer of the GAU-19 0.50 Caliber Machine Gun and is the only firm holding the design, development and software for this requirement.  GDATP owns the proprietary rights to the TDP, and it is unlikely that the Government will acquire the TDP for future procurements.  The time and cost to reverse engineer the gun and its components is estimated at four (4) years and $5.5 Million, which is also the estimate for a performance specification to be written.  Funds and time are not currently available for this effort, and in addition the design would have to go through Product Verification Testing and Air Worthiness Testing.  Development and testing costs would not be recouped through competition since these costs would be amortized over a very small quantity.  In addition, any qualified alternate source would require an additional two years of Production Lead Time after qualification to initiate product deliveries based upon a competitive procurement.<br/><br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Although this procurement will be restricted to the aforementioned contractor, every effort will be made to alert potential subcontractors.  This requirement was synopsized in the Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE) through FedBizopps.gov IAW FAR 5.201(d)(1) to further increase subcontracting opportunities and any proposal received shall be considered.<br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Technical design, development, data, and software knowledge are not available.  As stated, the 0.50 Caliber Machine Gun is a proprietary system developed and patented by GDATP.  Competition will not increase because the Program Manager has determined it would take four years of engineering effort at a cost of $5.5 Million to acquire a competitive TDP.  Furthermore, funds are not available to reverse engineer or to prepare a performance specification for this item.<br/><br/>8.  Market Research:  Market Research conducted in September 2009 by the TACOM Gatling Gun Weapon System Manager, AMSTA-LC-WSA,  resulted in the findings that GDATP is the only firm with the design, development, and technical knowledge necessary to successfully produce the 12.7mm (0.50-Caliber) Gatling gun for successful integration onto the broad range of platforms required by the Government.  The Gatling gun is a proprietary system developed and patented by GDATP.  No other sources exist within the worldwide market place to acquire this weapon without a long drawn out reverse engineering effort which has been determined not cost effective.<br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources: To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in writing.  The notices required by FAR 5.201 have been published, and any proposals received shall be considered.  <br/><br/>10.

Specifically, the contractor shall provide maintenance and logistics services for one-hundred-thirty (130) MPDS units under the United States Pacific Command (PACOM), twenty-five (25) units in SWA, one-hundred-twenty (120) in the CONUS and twenty (20) systems under the U.S. European Command (EURCOM), as well as provide training in the use of the MPDS. This proposed one year follow-on contract by TACOM-RI is to maintain continued field support during transition of contract support to TACOM-Warren. The total estimated cost for a one year period of performance on this effort is $900,000.00.<br/><br/>4. Authority Cited: 10 U.S.C 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".<br/><br/>5. Reason for Authority Cited: As authorized by FAR 6.302 1, specifically FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) which states "services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements," procurement by Other Than Full and Open Competition is necessary. <br/><br/>This proposed effort is a follow-on effort to contract M67004-04-P-1524. The spare/repair parts are an integral piece of the CLS effort to ensure that the warfighter in the field has the ability to successfully carry out decontamination missions in the event of a Chemical/Nuclear/Biological attack. K rcher Futuretech is the manufacturer of the MPDS and all parts required for assembly and repair and DRS has an exclusive distribution agreement with K rcher. Neither K rcher nor DRS provide a supply catalog to the Government or the public that identifies the part number. No other source would have the ability to provide the parts necessary to maintain the fielded MPDS's.<br/><br/>DRS is the only source with the technical knowledge of the system to provide maintenance and logistics, which is defined as the distribution of all spare and repair parts needed for preventive maintenance and repair of MPDS systems, technical repair of systems, parts distribution and technical support. The Government does not own any technical data rights, technical manuals or have access to the technical specifications associated with the system. Edgewood Chemical and Biological Center (ECBC) Engineers estimate that development of like parts necessary to train additional sources to perform this CLS service would take approximately 3.5 years and cost $4,000,000.00. This would be an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the requirements. DRS currently has a Field Service Representative in Korea, which allows for uninterrupted service to the soldier. Furthermore, the estimated $4,000,000.00 to create like parts necessary for training additional sources to perform the CLS service would not be expected to be recouped through competition. <br/><br/>Based on the above factors, DRS is the only responsible source capable of meeting the requirements of this follow-on CLS effort.<br/><br/>6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: In preparation for a follow-on contract a sources sought notice was issued via FBO in April 2007. In accordance with FAR part 12, this effort will be performed as a combined solicitation/synopsis under commercial acquisition procedures in Federal Business Opportunities (FBO). Any information received will be considered to determine if a competitive acquisition should be conducted.<br/><br/>7. Actions to Increase Competition: No further formal action to increase competition is contemplated at this time. DRS holds exclusive access to replacement parts for the MPDS pursuant to its agreement with the manufacturer, K rcher Futuretech. The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) will not authorize any other distributor access to these spares to perform the system maintenance required to meet the expectations of the Performance Work Statement.<br/><br/>8. Market Research: Market research for this proposed action began in April 2007 with a sources sought notice and has been on-going process since this time. Stephen LeFebvre, previously the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) until May 2009, and David Franing, ILS Manager, contacted both K rcher and DRS multiple times between 2007 and 2009 requesting access to the parts and manuals. The most recent contact was on 16 July 2009 to a Mr. Wolfgang Kliem from K rcher Futuretech GmbH (located in Winnenden, Germany). When asked about the availability of MPDS parts, he responded "DRS is the exclusive distributor for MPDS in the USA. Kindly contact: Mr. Jim Fritts at DRS in Florence KY." Mr. Franing also monitors the internet to stay abreast of any new partnerships with K rcher or DRS. In the August 3, 2009 edition of the DefenseNews, K rcher reaffirms their partnership with DRS.<br/><br/>9. Interested Sources: A sources sought notice was issued via FedBizOpps in 2007, solicitation #W52H0907R0316, seeking companies who could provide the CLS requirement for support of the MPDS. In response to the sources sought notice the Government received responses from MTC Technologies, Inc. and Patchin Soluble Integrated, Inc. Both companies responded stating that they could provide the required services in the PWS. A technical follow-up with both companies, conducted by ECBC Engineering and the TACOM Equipment Specialist, revealed that neither company was familiar with the MPDS system nor did they have access to the spare/repair parts needed to complete the services in the PWS. Both contractors stated that they had contacted the manufacturer, K rcher, and had been told that DRS was the exclusive distributor of the MPDS, and therefore the only company which had access to replacement parts for that unit. DRS refused to provide these companies with access to the spare and repair parts that would be needed to complete the services under the contract. The responding companies stated that they would need to reverse engineer the MPDS in order to develop spare parts which could be used for the maintenance of the units. As previously noted reverse engineering would neither be timely or cost effective in provided the proposed CLS service contract. <br/><br/>10. Other Facts: <br/><br/>Procurement History: The previous contract, M67004-04-P-1521, was awarded to Engineered Air Systems, Inc. (EASI) on September 29, 2004. The previous contract included 2 base years with three 12-month option periods. EASI was subsequently purchased by DRS Sustainment Systems on January 17, 2007. All three option periods have been exercised and DRS remains the current contractor for the previous effort until September 30, 2009.<br/><br/>11.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br/>FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br/>CMO # 09-266<br/><br/><br/>1.  Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army, Contracting Command, TACOM  (RI), Contracting Center Rock Island, IL  61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:  This action will result in a 3 year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Aardvark Tactical, Inc, the sole authorized Federal Distributor for Taser International.  Taser International is the actual manufacturer of the X26 Series, however, after discussions with Taser, they directed the Government to Aardvark Tactical.  Award is projected for the 3rd qtr FY09 and AWCF funds will be used.   An acquisition plan is not required because it does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan.  <br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:<br/><br/>a.	This action is for various parts for the X26 Stun Gun.  The proposed contractor is Aardvark Tactical, Inc. (ATI) located in Azusa, CA.  They are a small business supplier of the non-lethal weapons, riot control, force protection, and tactical equipment.  ATI's main role is a distributor of third-party tactical equipment to the military and police agencies.  It specializes as a "system integration hub", capable of acquiring, organizing, and repackaging products from separate sources into desired configurations for deliveries to specified locations.  Aardvark is the sole authorized Federal distributor for Taser International.<br/><br/>b.	The Taser X26 System meets the mission needs of the US Military via patented, proprietary Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) technology that utilizes electrical current to disrupt voluntary control of muscles.  This temporary neuromuscular incapacitation is typically more efficient and humane than other means of delivering a non-lethal force necessary to subdue fleeing, belligerent, or potentially dangerous subjects.  Furthermore, the acquisition of these particular items assures compatibility among currently-fielded items.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The items to be procured are:<br/><br/>										Maximum<br/>	ITEM					NSN				Estimated Qty<br/><br/>Firing Device, Non-Lethal	1095-01-543-2189       5,500<br/>Battery, Non-recharge		6135-01-528-6895       6,200<br/>Cartridge, Electrical		1095-01-528-6893       5,000<br/>Cartridge, Electrical		1095-01-528-6894       5,000<br/><br/>The total estimated value is $6,633,292.00.   <br/><br/><br/>4.  Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only one Responsible Source as implemented by FAR 6.302 1.                                                                                            <br/><br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  <br/><br/>    a. As authorized by FAR 6.302 1, procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary because the Government possesses no rights to the Technical Data Package for the end item or its components. The Taser X26 Series are commercial items proprietary to Taser International, however, per direction of Taser International action will be directed to Aardvark Tactical, the sole authorized Federal distributor. <br/><br/>    b. Although there may be other commercial solutions which could meet the requirements of the Taser X26 Series spare parts, the extended schedule ands costs associated with qualifying a new contractor makes this option prohibitive. If this particular acquisition is not executed via sole source to Aardvark Tactical, Inc., the US Government will not be able to equip personnel with items that meet mission needs within a reasonable budget and timeframe.  It is estimated that the development of qualification procedures would cost $50,000.00 and take 18 months to complete. Furthermore, once the qualification procedures are developed, it is estimated that the actual qualification of sources would cost an additional $2,000,000.00 and take an additional 24 months to complete.  The purpose of this contract is to provide sustainment support of the end item.  Aardvark Tactical is currently providing the Taser X26 Series in the field.  In order to maintain interchangeability with parts for field level repairs, it is necessary that the Taser X26 Series spare parts be procured from Aardvark Tactical, the sole authorized Federal distributor. <br/><br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  This requirement has been synopsized in FedBizOpps on 24 February 2009 to alert interested contractors and subcontractors.  <br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  There are currently no efforts to increase competition.  As stated in paragraph 5 above, the cost of qualifying another source is cost prohibitive, and it would not be recouped through competition. Funds are not  available to qualify another source.  <br/><br/>8.  Market Research:  Market research began in December 2008.  Individuals knowledgeable in general manufacturing, small arms weapon system design, and Government acquisition were consulted. The results of market research conducted to meet similar or identical requirements were reviewed.  On-line catalogs and other generally available product literature published by manufacturers, distributers, and dealers were reviewed, as well. Although there are other commercial stunt guns available, none can meet the US Government's needs for this particular acquisition because of the qualifications requirements discussed in paragraph 5. <br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources:  To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in this procurement.  The notices required by FAR 5.201 were published and any proposals received shall be considered.   <br/><br/>10.  Other Factors: <br/><br/>     Procurement History:  Previous procurement actions were accomplished by PM Sensors and Lasers.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/>11.  Technical Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the J&A are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br/><br/>Name:    XXXX           Date:  3 Mar 2009                       <br/><br/>Title:  Ch Small Cal Sys Branch  Signature: //signed//                    <br/><br/>12.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br/>FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br/>CMO # 09-271<br/><br/><br/>1.  Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army TACOM Contracting Center (RI) Rock Island, IL 61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:  This action will result in a Firm Fixed Price Service contract with Real-Time Laboratories, LLC.  Award is projected for the 3rd quarter of FY 09 and FY 09 Army Working Capital Funds (AWCF) will be used.  An acquisition plan is not required because it does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan. <br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The contractor shall provide the supplies and services necessary to repair and upgrade the Valve Linear, Direct. The contractor shall upgrade and rework   the following:<br/><br/>NSN: 4820-01-209-8415, P/N: 9376467<br/>NSN: 4820-01-304-9943, P/N: 9376467-2<br/>NSN: 4820-01-367-7564, P/N: 9376467-3 <br/>NSN: 4810-01-306-6406, P/N: 12273262-3 <br/><br/>The repair and or upgrade will meet NSN: 4820-01-308-1858, P/N: 9376467-1 configuration. The estimated value is $750,000.00 for the initial repair and upgrade 500 each. The proposed contract will include two (2) 100 percent options, for an overall total of 1,500 each at an estimated dollar value of $2,250,000.00.  <br/><br/>4.  Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304(c) (1), "Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements as authorized by FAR 6.302-1".<br/><br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  As authorized by FAR 6.302 1, procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary because Real-Time Laboratories is the only source that can satisfy the army's requirements.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Government's technical data for the Valve Linear Direct is source controlled to three manufacturers, Real-Time Labs, Kelsey-Hayes Company and Teledyne Fluid Systems. Neither, Kelsey-Hayes or Teledyne is currently registered in any of the Government's registration systems. However, the only qualified and approved current source is Real-Time Laboratories.  To qualify a previous or a new source would take approximately six (6) months up to a year and a half, if not more and cost the Government an estimated $1,000,000.00.<br/><br/>Neither, Kelsey-Hayes or Teledyne is qualified due to ARDEC's understanding that approved sources are sources that were qualified at one point and they were listed as such on the drawing when their products met full requirements of TDP 9376467. Sources that had been acquired, relocated, ceased production for a period of one year or more (some exception may apply), or restructured in a manner that had altered their process of producing the Valve, would have to re-qualify to prove their newly produced product. The process of qualification is tedious, costly, and time consuming. A team composed of engineering and quality assurance would have to participate in the product evaluation at the contractor's designated facility. Examples of required tests are to be in accordance with specification 01417-SC-X17727 which include functional, environmental, performance, etc. and other requirements listed on the drawing. Once the product successfully meets all requirements of the TDP, then the source would be qualified as an approved source of supply and an engineering action would be initiated to list the source on the drawing. The time required to qualify a source is not a warrantee of its success, therefore the time utilized to qualify a source may deem fruitless at the end and hence back to the starting point and repeat the process. The qualification process may take roughly from 6 months up to a year and a half if not more, provided that all goes well. <br/><br/>The source would have to be either funded, if the Government wished to follow through in pursuing this avenue, or have the source voluntarily fund and accommodate the qualification process if interested. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Requalification of these sources or qualification of a new source can not be accomplished within the required timeframe necessary for continued spares availability for tank support in Iraq.The Government cannot wait for a source to become qualified and there are no funds available to fund this effort. <br/>Real-Time has indicated that they can meet the required turnaround time 90 days and with the estimated quantities of 17 each per month, needed to be repaired and or upgraded. Due to the impact that pursuit for qualification may have to the continued readiness and sustainment of the Army's war efforts, it is logical and prudent to pursue a source that is already producing the valve successfully (or had produced it in the not too distant past with no; alteration to the process). It is ARDEC's recommendation that the Government pursue efforts to utilize Real Time Laboratories as the current remaining approved source of supply that may meet immediate and expedient war effort requirements.<br/><br/>Based on the above facts, these units can only be repaired within 90 days after award and at a rate of 17 each per month, by the approved source/previous producer Real-Times Laboratory, of these units and no other source can get qualified in the necessary timeframe to meet the requirements.  <br/><br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  This requirement will be synopsized to further increase both contracting and subcontracting opportunities IAW FAR 5.201 (c). <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition: NSN: 4820-01-308-1858, P/N: 9376467-1 will be listed on the Competition Advocates Shopping List. Interested sources will be able to become a qualified vendor by participating in the Source Approval Program. Once qualified a new source can compete for future repair and or upgrade efforts.<br/><br/>8.  Market Research:  FEDBIZOPPS - Sources sought was issued by TACOM Contracting Center Rock Island, AMSCC-TAC-ARVA (Heavy/Light Contracting Group on 10 Mar 2009, in the attempt to alert potential contractors to inform the Government of their interest in this requirement.  <br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources:  To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in writing. The notices required by FAR 5.201 will be published and any proposals received shall be considered. <br/><br/>10.  Other Factors: <br/><br/>     Procurement History:  The items identified in paragraph 3, have been purchased before as Sole Source Items to Real-Time Laboratories:<br/><br/>Contract: W52H09-05-D-0277<br/>Contractor: Real-Time Laboratories LLC<br/>Award Date: 2 Aug 2005Competitive Status: Sole Source<br/>Authority: FAR 6.302 1<br/>Control No.:  Unknown<br/><br/>*11.

<ARCHDATE>04282010
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL<br/>AND OPEN COMPETITION<br/>CMO # 08-542<br/><br/>1.  Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army TACOM LCMC (RI), Rock Island, IL 61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action: This action will result in a firm fixed price with HR Textron Incorporated. The award is projected for the 4th quarter of FY08 AWCF - FY08 funds will be used. An acquisition plan is not required because it does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan.<br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services: The proposed contract is for the Circuit Card Assembly, NSN: 5998-01-192-4093, P/N: 36065-1. Requirements will include a total quantity of 100 each for an estimated total value of $374,782.00 and two (2) 50 percent options for a total of $749,564.00.<br/><br/>4.  Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304 (c) (1) only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements as authorized by FAR 6.302-1.<br/><br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  As authorized by FAR 6.302-1, procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary because HR Textron Incorporated is the Sole Source manufacturer of this Circuit Card Assembly. HR Textron is the prime contractor, designer and developer of the Gun Turret Drive System of which this Circuit Card Assembly is a component of this system. They are the only know contractor having the expertise, configuration control and tooling necessary to meet the Government's need.  This item is proprietary to HR Textron Incorporated. A competitive Technical Data Package (TDP) is not available. The Government does not own or have the rights to the TDP.<br/><br/>The estimated engineering costs are associated with development and qualification procedures required by FAR to compete, this item is estimated at over $100,000.00. Additional costs associated with conducting this process including reverse engineering and analysis (to include the cost for any additional test equipment or fixtures, higher level assemblies and other required items needed to test this part. Plus any costs to test facilities if applicable) to develop and test a TDP qualified to meet our requirements. The cost for this effort is estimated at a minimum $150,000.00. In addition the estimated schedule to develop the required TDP and qualification procedures is expected to be over 24 months. The schedule is based on the estimated number of weeks/months that will be required to perform the above tasks (this includes conducting the actual testing, reviewing the engineering data and preparing a technical report) and finally to determine whether or not a new source has successfully met the qualification process noted above and can be added to the referenced drawings. The timeframe for this effort is estimated at a minimum of 24 months. There is no funding available to qualify a new source. If a customer would wish to explore this option and provide the funding to qualify a new source, then the design activity may trigger a process to do so. However, keep in mind that even if a new source were to be pursued, the end outcome may not be fruitful.  This item is only required on the M1A1 Abrams Tank and is reaching a point where demand is decreasing.  Deliveries are required as soon as possible. Therefore award of this requirement cannot possibly be delayed for 24 months awaiting qualification of another source. <br/><br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition: This requirement will be synopsized in FedBizOpps to further increase subcontracting opportunities as required by FAR 5.201 (c). <br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Competition will not increase because the cost to acquire the TDP is prohibitive. This item is specific to the M1 Abrams Tank and is only available from HR Textron. Funds are not available to purchase the TDP, to reverser engineer this item, or to prepare performance specifications for this item.<br/><br/>8.  Market Research:  Market Research was performed on 28 July 2008 the assigned engineer, based on an inadequate TDP and on his expertise and knowledge made a technical evaluation that there is no commercial equivalent to satisfy this requirement. <br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources:  To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in writing.<br/><br/>10.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>W52H09-09-C-0120
<ARCHDATE>04282010
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br/>FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br/>CMO # 09-474<br/><br/><br/><br/>1.  Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army Contracting Command, TACOM, Contracting Center  (RI) Rock Island, IL 61299 7630<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:  This action will result in a Firm Fixed Price contract with Tri-Technologies, award is projected for the end of the fourth quarter of FY09 and FY09 PAA funds will be used.  An acquisition plan is not required because it does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan.   <br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services: Procurement for 850 each new 3rd Generation Loader's Trays: NSN: 1015-01-537-0697, P/N: 13010524 to Support Abrams M1A1 and M1A2 Production/RESET/Field Mod Programs.  The proposed contract will include an option provision for 250 each. The estimated value is $1,375,000.00.  <br/><br/>4. Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304(c) (1): Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements by FAR 6.302 1.<br/><br/>5. Reason for Authority Cited:  As authorized by FAR 6.302 1, procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary because Tri-Technologies is currently the only source that has been able to produce this critically required Loaders Tray. Tri-Technology is currently in production and shipping units. They are the only source that can meet the delivery schedule of April 2010. <br/><br/>a.	The proposed acquisition is to support the Production/RESET/Field Mod efforts of the M1A1 & M1A2 vehicles needing 3rd Generation Loaders Trays for the Abrams Tank System. Tri-Technologies, was involved with the redesign of the Loader Trays to the new 3rd Generation Loader Trays, and is currently producing/shipping these units. As a current producer of the Loader Tray, the First Article Test will be waived. Although the Technical Data Package (TDP) has been determined to be adequate for competitive acquisitions, a new source could potentially encounter some of the same problems as the previous producer, with passing the First Article Test and meeting production requirements.  The current production schedule requires 80 units per month for Jan - Jun 2010. Then it drops down to 50 units per month Jul - Dec 2010. The remaining 320 units are required to upgrade the Abrams Tanks that have already gone through the production line without the latest configuration of the Deflector Blast.  <br/><br/>b.	The current competitive acquisition for the 450 units, are required to support the spare field requirements and are not part of the production requirements. This item has proven to be technically challenging and the current competitive acquisition for 450 units was re-opened for proposals on 3 Jun 2009. Due to the technical aspects of this unit, the Government determined that those offerors wanting to submit a proposal were requested to build and deliver a prototype to TACOM Contracting Center Rock Island for evaluation along with their proposals.<br/><br/>c.	Based on this requirement the usual 30 days required to submit a proposal is now 120 days after issuance, anticipate closing of solicitation on or about 29 Sep 2009 a proposal and a prototype will be submitted by each offeror. The process of evaluating each proposal will be based on a Go/No Go testing of the prototype, past performance and price. An award is anticipated on or about 31 Dec 2009. The production support group at TACOM LCMC RI, provided Manufacturing Lead Time Estimating Worksheet; which indicates the FAT -143 days after award, on or about 23 May 2010 and an additional 30 days for the Government to approve the test, estimated to be 23 Jun 2010. The first production units would then be ready to ship at 240 days after award, estimated to be 28 Aug 2010. This data is based on anticipated award date of 31 Dec 2009. <br/><br/>1.	Previous producer lost its contract due to failure to meet the requirements and functional test for the Loader Trays. <br/><br/>2.	Tri-Technologies located in Mt. Vernon, NY are currently producing this item and has delivered 317 units out of 1,300 each new 3rd Generation Loaders Trays. At this time Tri-Technologies are currently 163 units short of the contracted delivery schedule of 600 units to have been delivered by Aug 2009. <br/><br/>3.	This requirement will result in a new contractual action to be Sole Sourced to Tri-Technologies. The total estimated value of this entire effort is $1,375,000.00 with deliveries commencing April 2010 if not earlier. An award to Tri-Technologies will fill the gap, caused by the prior contractor's failure to produce a serviceable unit. Based on the history of this item and the difficulty experienced to produce a functional unit, there is a good probability that a new source may not be able to meet the delivery date on the competitive action of this item. The option will only be used to cover the Government's requirements should there be a delay in deliveries from the competitive action.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Therefore based on the above information sole source procurement to Tri-Technologies is the only alternative the Government has to meet the Army's required delivery date.<br/><br/>d.	Production/RESET/Field Mod requirements are being used in making and resetting (repairing, overhauling and bringing to an issuable condition to sustain readiness) Abrams M1A1 and M1A2 vehicles in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).  <br/><br/>This requirement became known on or about February 2009 and based on the above information, Sole Source award of this requirement to Tri-Technologies must be accomplished under FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements. Using normal procurement methods, a contract could not be competed and awarded in time to meet the Production/RESET/Field Mod's for the M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams Tanks, and meet the April 2010 required delivery schedule. <br/><br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition: This procurement action was synopsized in the FEDBIZOPPS to alert interested contractors and subcontractors. This action produced 30 or more interested contractors. <br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition: The Technical Data Package is available for a competitive acquisition. The next buy will be competitive  <br/><br/>8.  Market Research:  Market research was conducted by this office on 29 Jan 2009 and it generated interest from at least 30 companies.  Interested parties were invited to attend a pre-proposal conference to give them an opportunity to see the unit and how it functions and the critical need for these units to function correctly. Interested parties included the previous contractor for these units, Hoosier and their sub-vendor Matrix. Based on experience and problems Hoosier and Matrix had in producing a functional unit, a new source would have a difficult time manufacturing this item and would not be able to meet the Government's required delivery date.   <br/>             <br/>9.  Interested Sources: To date, there have been over 30 interested sources that have expressed an interest in writing. The notices required by FAR 5.201 have been published and any proposals received shall be considered.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>10.  Other Factors: <br/><br/>     Procurement History:<br/><br/>Contract: W52H09-06-D-0267 - cannot produce a functional unit and is not in production.<br/>  	Contractor: Hoosier Industrial Supply Inc<br/>	Award Date: 29 August 2006<br/>	Competitive Status: Small Business Set-aside<br/>	Authority: N/A<br/>	Control No:  N/A<br/><br/>Contract:  W52H09-09-C-0010<br/>Contractor: Tri-Technologies<br/>Award Date: 28 October 2008, <br/>Competitive Status:  Sole Source Authority: FAR 6.302-1<br/>Control No.: CMO 08-487<br/><br/>        <br/>11.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br/>                FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br/><br/>1.  Contracting Agency:  Army Contracting Command/TACOM Contracting Center Rock Island, IL 61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:  This action will result in a Firm Fixed Price, three year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Cadillac Gage/HR Textron. Award is projected for the 2nd quarter of FY 09 and FY 09 and Army Working Capital Funds (AWCF) will be used.  An acquisition plan is not required because it does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan.<br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services: The requirement is for 250 each Circuit Card Assembly, NSN: 5998-01-455-7667, P/N: 44522 to support the M1/M1A1 Abrams series vehicles. Total estimated dollar value of this item for the proposed three year IDIQ is $2,511,254.00.<br/><br/>4. Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304(c) (1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements as authorized by FAR 6.302 1.<br/><br/>5. Reason for Authority Cited:  As authorized by FAR 6.302 1, procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary because Cadillac Gage/HR Textron is the sole source manufacturer of the aforementioned item. Cadillac Gage/HR Textron is the prime contractor, designer and developer of the item. The Government does not presently own adequate technical data or performance specifications necessary to support competitive purchasing. There are also no qualification procedures available per AMSRD-AAR-AIS-TD. They further reported that to develop qualification procedures and a competitive technical data package would cost approximately $3,500,000.00 and take approximately 156 weeks.  The actual Engineering analysis includes the cost for any additional test equipment or fixtures, higher level assemblies and or end item system. Plus any costs for test facilities as applicable is estimated to cost $7,500,000.00. This analysis is estimated to take an additional 156 days to accomplish. These costs are not anticipated to be recovered by the Government. <br/><br/><br/>Due to the fact that the technical data is unavailable, the estimates given in the AQPSE form are quite high. In order to accurately assure the physical portion of a redesign, it was estimated that an Abrams tank would need to shoot 100 rounds. The rounds are worth about $2,000.00 each. This requirement would be necessary to simulate the life cycle that this circuit card would need to survive. Additionally some of these firings would need to be conducted at high and low temperature extremes while in the GTD assembly.  With the above estimated need of testing and engineering, and the scheduling issues with multiple organizations and test sites a redesign would at best be lengthy and it is highly likely that the first designs would fail either physically, or after nuclear hardness testing. <br/>Any delay is unacceptable, therefore based on the above information sole source procurement from Cadillac Gage/HR Textron is the only method of procurement available to insure the Government receives this critical technology item by the required delivery date of 28 Apr 2009.<br/><br/><br/>The initial Procurement Work Directive (PWD) was issued on 15 Oct 2008 and the Customers Required Delivery Dates (CRDD), is 28 Apr 2009. Since there is no competitive TDP for this item, Cadillac Gage/HR Textron is the only contractor capable of meeting the RDD.<br/><br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition: This requirement will be synopsized to further increase both contracting and sub-contracting opportunities IAW FAR 5.201 (c).<br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  There are is no competitive TDP, nor are there qualification procedures available and the cost to develop the TDP and qualification procedures to include engineering analysis, test equipment, fixtures, end item systems and test facilities is well over six million dollars. Because of this estimate, and because it is not anticipated that the Government would be able to recover the costs required to produce  competitive technical data, further attempts to increase competition does not make sense at this time. <br/><br/>8.  Market Research: Market Research was performed by AMSRD-AAR-AIS-CML ARDEC engineer on 6 Nov 2008. Based on an inadequate technical data package and his expertise and knowledge of the circuit card assembly, the assigned engineer made a technical evaluation/determination. There is no commercial equivalent to satisfy this requirement. No commercial item will satisfy the Army's need without qualification testing. Developing new competitive sources for the current requirements would not be cost effective. In addition it would unnecessarily delay delivery of these items within the required timeframe.  <br/> <br/>9.  Interested Sources: To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in writing. The notices required by FAR 5.201 will be published and any proposals received shall be considered.  <br/><br/>10.

<AWDNBR>W52H09-09-C-0116
<ARCHDATE>04282010
<DESC><br/>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br/>FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br/><br/><br/>1.  Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army TACOM Contracting Center, Rock Island, IL 61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:  This action will result in a firm fixed price contract with General Manufacturing.  Award is projected for the (4th Qtr FY 2009) and FY 2007 APA funds will be used.  An acquisition plan is not required because it does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan.  <br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  76 each 60MM Mortar Mounts, NSN 1010-01-521-1614, PN 11579090.   The estimated value is $384,977.24.   The proposed contract will not include an option provision.  <br/><br/>4.  Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304(c)(2), (FAR Title) as implemented by FAR 6.302 2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.<br/><br/> <br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  Procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary because the items are urgently required by the PM for units directly engaged in the Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation and Enduring Freedom (OEF) missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.  A total of 76 are needed by the PM at the earliest possible date.   Although the Government owns a competitive technical data package (TDP), the normal lead time, including first article test report, for the 60MM Mortar Mount is XXXdays after contract award.   <br/><br/>     The urgency first became known to exist in July of 2009. At that time it was identified that delivery of the new Light Weight M170 bipods would not meet the required fielding schedule as established by the G-8.  The PM has a contract for the new Light Weight M170 Bipods with Matech (W15QKN-08-C-0455).  During contract performance, technical issues arose which identified problems with the technical data package (TDP).  Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) actions to remedy the technical issues were complete by the end of February, 2009. However, deficiencies in the contractor's accounting system were then discovered.  The contractor was unable to provide accurate and verifiable pricing data due to the deficient accounting/costing system.  Therefore, extensive audits were required, and then protracted discussions with the contractor were required to resolve the deficiencies in their proposal.  For these reasons, implementation of the ECPs was delayed until the end of August 2009.   Thus, the current delivery schedule for the new Light Weight M170 Bipods on Matech's contract is March 2010 for first article test (FAT) and Jun 2010 for the first production lot.<br/><br/>     General Manufacturing is the only recent supplier of the 60MM Mortar Mount. It produced the item under Contract W52H09-06-C-0030 which was awarded as the result of a competitive solicitation.  Since then, Contract W52H09-09-C-0116 was awarded on 28 Aug 2009 under urgency procedures for a quantity of 211 each needed to cover backorders and increased demands due to increased failures, RESET, and the above stated delays in fielding the new light weight bipods.  It is the only potential supplier that has the tooling, recent experience, and will not require a first article test and is therefore able to deliver the product significantly sooner than any other producer. Estimated delivery will be on or before 26Mar 2010 for the quantity of 211 each.  The additional quantity needed by the PM could be added to this contract under Modification P00002, with an anticipated delivery of the 76 on or before 30 Apr 2010. <br/><br/>      Competitive RFP W52H09-09-R-0069, which will result in a firm fixed price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with 4 Ordering Periods in effect through 31 Dec 2013, is currently on the street and is expected to close on 19 Oct 2009 with award anticipated in December 2009.  If awarded to a contractor requiring a first article, deliveries will not begin until 420 days after award of the contract (estimated to be 24 Feb 2011).  <br/><br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Competition for this procurement action is not being pursued due to the urgent need for the items.  <br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  A competitive RFP which will result in an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with 4 Ordering Periods in effect through <br/>31 Dec 2013, is currently on the street and is expected to close on 19 Oct 2009.<br/><br/>8.  Market Research:    There is a competitive TDP in place defining the exact, form, fit and function of the parts.  The parts are unique military items used only on the 60MM Mortar which has no commercial equivalent.  The components of the assemblies are also defined by TDP to assure form, fit, and function and are also procured competitively. A review of product literature made available on line by manufacturers, distributors, and dealers shows no commercial or non-developmental item that will satisfy the Army's requirement for these items.<br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources:  There will be other sources interested in the competitive acquisition but there are none that could have first article waived and therefore none that can deliver a product before General Manufacturing. <br/><br/>10.

Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination:  I hereby determine that the anticipated cost for this contract action will be determined fair and reasonable based on price analysis.

Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army Contracting Command, TACOM, Contracting Center (RI) Rock Island, IL  61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:  This action will result in a firm-fixed price, three year, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Type contract with Insight Technology.  Award is projected for the fourth quarter FY09 and AWCF type funds will be used.  An acquisition plan is not required because it does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan.  <br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  This action is for various spare parts for the Mini-Integrated Pointing Illumination Module (MIPIM).                                             <br/><br/>The items to be procured are:<br/><br/>ITEM                      NSN                   MAX QTY  <br/>Reflector Assembly        1240-01-551-5418      22,000<br/>White Light Cap Assembly  5855-01-550-5219      28,000<br/>Kit, Pattern Generator    1240-01-551-3779      28,000<br/>Battery Cap Assembly      6160-01-551-3780	   18,000<br/>Cap, Protective, Dust     5340-01-554-1587	   28,000<br/><br/>The total estimated dollar value is $4,500,000.00<br/><br/>4.  Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only one Responsible Source, as implemented by FAR 6.302 1 <br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  As authorized by FAR 6.302 1, procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary as Insight Technology is the sole manufacturer capable of delivering the above listed spare parts to support the MIPIM based on the following facts;<br/><br/>a.	A Solicitation was issued as a competitive best value based on a Government performance specification in response to a Government requirement for a commercial/non-developmental Mini-Integrated Pointing Illumination Module(MIPIM) in June 2005. Award was directed by Department of Army and PEO Soldier, Sensors, and Lasers to be a dual source award with a minimum order of 2,000 systems to be procured from the companies whose proposals were determined to be a best-value to the Government. <br/><br/>The Government received nine samples from six offerors in response to the Government's solicitation. After evaluation of each offeror's product and based on the best value evaluation criteria, the Government selected the MIPIM produced by Insight Technology as one of the items best suited to meet the Government's requirement.  Contract W91CRB-05-D-0028 was awarded to Insight Technology on 13 September 2005 as a Firm-Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity type contract for initial production quantities.<br/><br/>b.	Procurement of above listed spare parts will be used to support purchases of the MIPIM system from Insight Technology. The current proposed procurement action for spare parts to support the MIPIM is restricted to Insight Technology in order to maintain interchangeability and functionality of the MIPIM. The MIPIM is proprietary to Insight Technology and Insight Technology is the sole manufacturer of the MIPIM and the spare parts required to maintain the MIPIM. <br/><br/>c.	The Government possesses no rights to the Technical Data Package (TDP) for the end item or its components.  Development of a competitive TDP would require extensive qualification testing, complete disassembly, and gauging and material determination of each component part. Generation of new drawings, design analysis and prototypes will have to be manufactured and tested to ensure comparability, reliability, and operability within the main item assembly.  Cost estimates to develop a competitive MIPIM TDP, inclusive of spare-parts, totals $15,000,000; $9,000,000.00 and 12 months for TDP development and $6,000,000 and 9-12 months for engineering costs. The cost for purchasing the MIPIM data rights from Insight Technology is $20,000,000.00.<br/><br/>d.	The Government has determined it is not in the best interest to acquire or develop a competitive TDP package based on the cost associated with developing/acquiring a competitive TDP and due to rapid evolution of Aiming Light technology. The manufacturer of other like end items, and parts do not meet compatibility and interchangeability requirements to support fielded systems of the MIPIM.      <br/><br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  This requirement was synopsized in FedBizOpps on June 9th, 2009 to alert interested contractors and subcontractors.  <br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition: There are currently no efforts to increase competition as the cost of either developing or acquiring TDP is cost prohibitive and not in the best interest of the Government.  <br/><br/>8.  Market Research:  Market research for the end item MIPIM from Insight Technology was conducted in June 2005 by PM Soldier, Sensors, and Lasers. Source lists were obtained of similar commercial/non-developmental items from other contracting activities and agencies. As stated in paragraph 5 above, in order to maintain interchangeability and functionality of the MIPIM it is recommended that a sole-source award to Insight Technology be pursued. <br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources:  To date, no other sources have expressed interest in this procurement.  The notices required by FAR 5.201 have been published and any proposals received shall be considered. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>10.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br/>FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br/>CMO # 09-348<br/><br/>1.  Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army TACOM LCMC (RI) Rock Island, IL  61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:  This action will result in a Firm Fixed Price contract with Ripa Engineering Corp.   Award is projected for the 3rd quarter FY09 and PA and AWCF funds will be used.  An acquisition plan is not required because it does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan.  <br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  850 each 7.62mm Mandrel, P/N 13023642, 850 each 40mm Mandrel, P/N 13022752, and 850 each .50 Cal Mandrel, P/N 13022751 (NSNs not assigned yet).  End Use:  Boresight Kit for the Common Remotely Operated Weapons Station (CROWS) II XM153 System.   The estimated value is $700,000.00.  The proposed contract will include a provision for a 100 percent evaluated option resulting in a total estimated dollar value of $1,400,000.00.<br/><br/>4.  Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302 1 (Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements).<br/><br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  Procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary because a technical data package (TDP) suitable for competition is not currently available.  The CROWS program fielded the CROWS I system and is now fielding the CROWS II system.  CROWS I uses a boresight kit which is not accurate enough for the CROWS II system.  Some off-shelf boresight alignment tools were procured initially for CROWS II.  The high cost of these tools created a need to design a new boresight kit for the CROWS II program.  The selected borescope for CROWS II is an 8X adjustable scope.  This new scope is compatible with the Laser Borelight System (LBS) and has the required capability to be calibrated during use by the CROWS system operator.  The LBS is associated equipment for all current boresight systems and provides a capability for selected specific steps during the overall boresighting process.  Use of the 8X scope and the LBS requires adapting mandrels for the four different caliber weapons used on the CROWS II system.<br/><br/>The CROWS II and associated Vanguard system requires multiple hundreds of boresight kits.  Each system carries a boresight kit as Basic Issue Items (BII).  The requirement for boresight kits parallels the 8X scope and the LBS.  Mandrels and other kit parts must be available when scopes are delivered.  The driving factor is production delivery and fielding of the CROWS and Vanguard systems.  Scopes and LBS systems must be available when the CROWS and Vanguard systems are delivered due to the BII condition (1 for 1).  Thus the 8X scope, CROWS and Vanguard system fielding schedule dictate when the remaining parts of the boresight kit must be available.  Production delivery of quality mandrels has supported the CROWS II requirement to date.  A new contract is required to keep deliveries of mandrels and other parts compatible with fielding of the CROWS and Vanguard systems.  Competitive procurement is planned when the drawings become available.  In the interim, the only available source for the new design mandrels is the original contractor - Ripa Engineering.  Additionally, if awarded to any other contractor than Ripa, an additional six months is added to the procurement leadtime for first article testing.  This contract will contain a provision for 100% option for each mandrel.  The 100% option will only be exercised if the mandrels are needed before deliveries from a competitive procurement would be expected.  <br/><br/> BII products for these critical weapons assume the same level of priority as the weapons.  The maintaining of this critical support of US Army equipment requires sole source procurement of the boresight mandrels from Ripa.  Competitive procurement cannot be pursued until a procurable TDP becomes available which is estimated to be January 2010.  The impact of not procuring the required boresight mandrels in a timeframe compatible with the fielding schedule for CROWS and Vanguard would be an inability of the systems to operate at 100% efficiency.  Inaccurate boresighted weapons would severely decrease the ability to effectively engage selected targets.  <br/><br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  This procurement action has been synopsized in the FedBizOpps per FAR 5.201 to alert interested contractors and subcontractors.  <br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  As stated above, Ripa Engineering delivered technical drawings under production contract W52H09-08-C-0145.  The drawings are currently being reviewed by ARDEC engineering.  The drawings will be completed and developed into Level III drawings suitable for competitive procurement, estimated for January 2010.  <br/><br/>8.  Market Research:   A market survey conducted in March 2008 by the CROWS Logistic Management Specialist, AMSTA-LC-WSIC, for the mandrels for the CROWS II identified Ripa Engineering Corp. as a source.   Contract W52H09-08-C-0145 was awarded to Ripa in July 2008 and they are currently in production of the 100% option quantities.  The contract price included the cost to generate a drawing package for each configuration of mandrels.  Using early draft drawings and sketches prepared by TACOM-RI maintenance personnel, TACOM-RI personnel and ARDEC engineers coordinated with the contractor to make prototype mandrels.  The mandrels were tested and the designs accepted.  The technical documentation is currently under review and development.  As soon as the TDPs are complete, approved by ARDEC and deposited in the technical data repository, these items can become competitive.  The date forecast for availability of a TDP suitable for competition is January 2010.   Based on the market research conducted in March 2008, the government will have fully competitive drawings available in January 2010, therefore additional market research is not considered necessary.<br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources: To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in writing.  The notices required by FAR 5.201 will be published and any proposals received will be considered. <br/><br/>10.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br/>FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br/><br/><br/>1.  Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army TACOM Contracting Center, Rock Island, IL 61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:  This action will result in a firm fixed price contract with either General Manufacturing, Connectec Company, or McNally Industries.  Award is projected for the (4th Qtr FY 2009) and FY 2009 Army Working Capital Funds (AWCF) will be used.  An acquisition plan is not required because it does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan.  <br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  300 each Collar Shock Absorbers, NSN 1010-01-063-7680, PN 11579637. The estimated value is $420,000.   The proposed contract will not include an option provision.  <br/><br/>4.  Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304(c)(2), (FAR Title) as implemented by FAR 6.302 2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency.<br/><br/> <br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  Procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary because the items are urgently required in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation and Enduring Freedom (OEF).  Although the Government owns a competitive technical data package (TDP), the normal lead time for the Collar Shock Absorber is XXX days after contract award.  A total of 300 Collar Shock Absorbers are needed at the earliest possible date to sustain 60MM Mortars in use in OIF and OEF.   There are currently XXX backorders for the Collar Shock Absorber and an average monthly demand (AMD) of XXX. <br/><br/> Non-availability of the Collar Shock Absorber makes a mortar non-mission capable (NMC) and degrades the operational readiness of units engaged in combat, increasing the risk to soldier survivability.  The urgent nature of the buy for the 300 Collar Shock Absorbers - a critical component of the Mortar Mount - is based on the following factors:<br/>    <br/>1.	(OPSEC) <br/><br/>2.	The introduction of new lightweight mortar components to replace current 60MM mortar components has been delayed well beyond original expectations due to the need to incorporate engineering changes based on test results.  This delay has caused a shortfall of mortar components since initial requirements for legacy spare parts were based on the assumption that the replacement bipod and spares would be available in 2nd QTR FY 09.  Current projections are that the replacement will not be ready until 2nd QTR FY 10.  <br/><br/>General Manufacturing, Connectec Co., and McNally Industries are the only recent suppliers of the 60MM Mortar Mount. It was produced by General Manufacturing as part of the M177 Mortar Mount under Contract W52H09-06-C-0030.  It was produced by Connectec Co. under contracts W52H09-05-C-0199 and W52H09-07-P-0493.  It was produced by McNally Industries under contract W52H09-07-C-0144. All of the aforementioned contracts were awarded as the result of competitive solicitations.   Because of the ability to have a first article test waived and/or because each of these sources has the tooling and experience to make this item each will be able to deliver the product significantly sooner than any other producer. Estimated delivery will be on or before (OPSEC).  <br/><br/>A new competitive RFP which will result in a four year firm fixed price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract is currently in process and is expected to be issued shortly with award anticipated in November 2009. If awarded to a contractor requiring a first article, deliveries will not begin until 390 days after award of the contract (estimated to be December 2010).  <br/><br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Competition for this procurement action is not being pursued due to the urgent need for the items.  <br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  A competitive RFP which will result in a four year firm fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract is currently in process and is expected to be issued within one or two weeks.   <br/><br/>8.  Market Research:    There is a competitive TDP in place defining the exact, form, fit and function of the parts.  The parts are unique military items used only on the 60MM Mortar which has no commercial equivalent.  The components of the assemblies are also defined by TDP to assure form, fit, and function and are also procured competitively. A review of product literature made available on line by manufacturers, distributors, and dealers shows no commercial or non-developmental item that will satisfy the Army's requirement for these items.<br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources:  There will be other sources interested in the competitive acquisition but there are none that could have first article waived and therefore none that can deliver a product before General Manufacturing, Connectec Co., or McNally Industries. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>10.

Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army TACOM Contracting Center, Rock Island, IL 61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:  This action will result in a firm fixed price, 5-year, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with FN Manufacturing LLC (FN).  Award is projected for the 2nd Quarter FY 10 and Army Working Capital Funds (AWCF) will be used.  An acquisition plan is not required because it does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan.<br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  FN303 Firing Device, NSN: 1095-01-526-7860, Minimum Guaranteed Quantity is 1,500 each; Maximum Contract Quantity is 5,000 each. The estimated value is $3,815,000.00. The proposed contract will not include an option provision.<br/><br/>4.  Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.<br/><br/> <br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  As authorized by FAR 6.302 1, procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary as FN is the developer and sole manufacturer of the FN303. The FN303 is a non-lethal weapon utilized for crowd/riot control. A Government TDP is not available. No qualification procedures are available. According to ARDEC Engineering, to establish qualification procedures as required by the FAR to compete this item would result in an estimated engineering cost of approximately $50,000 and consume approximately 18 months of effort.  Additionally, reverse engineering would consume approximately 48 months and cost approximately $4,000,000. <br/><br/>In order to maintain functionality and interchangeability with existing assets, sole source procurement for FN is necessary. Failure to maintain interchangeability and functionality may result in failure of function of the FN303, thus resulting in harm to the user.<br/><br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  This procurement action was synopsized on October 22, 2009 in the FedBizOpps to alert interested contractors and subcontractors.<br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Due to prohibitive cost to develop a competitive Technical Data Package, no further actions are being taken. Future requirements will be publicized via FedBizOps.<br/><br/>8.  Market Research:  Market research was conducted on May 12, 2009 by the Government Engineer specifically assigned to this project. The resources included colleagues who are experts in the small arms manufacturing, design and acquisition. The research resulted in a determination that these items are Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) involving proprietary technology unique to FN and no other product(s) meets the same need to maintain interchangeability.  <br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources: To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in writing. The notices required by FAR 5.201 have been published and any proposals received shall be considered.  <br/><br/>10.

Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army TACOM LCMC (RI) Rock Island, IL  61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:  This action will result in a sole source, firm fixed price 5 year requirements contract with the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC), CAGE 98247.  The CCC will act as the prime contractor for Raytheon Canada Limited ("Elcan"), CAGE 36126. Award is projected for the 4th quarter of FY 08 and Army Working Capital Funds will be used.  Historically, these items were bought on individual Purchase Orders.  The proposed contract type will prove to be beneficial to obtaining parts more expeditiously, not to mention the time savings of the acquisition process.  An acquisition plan is not required because it does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan.<br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  This procurement is for ten (10) distinct spare parts to the M145 Machine Gun Optic (MGO) as follows:<br/><br/>1) Plug, Protective, NSN 5340-21-920-5501<br/>2) Cover, Battery, NSN 6160-21-920-2487<br/>3) Cap, Assembly, Front, NSN 6650-21-920-2502;<br/>4) Bar, Locking, NSN 1240-21-920-2514<br/>5) Cover, Rubber, NSN 6650-21-920-2508<br/>6) O-Ring, NSN 5331-21-920-3021;<br/>7) Nut, Self-Locking, NSN 5310-21-920-2488<br/>8) Cap, Assembly, Rear, NSN 6650-21-920-2495;<br/>9) Filter Assembly, NSN 6650-21-920-2497;<br/>10) Mount Assembly M145, NSN 1240-21-920-2492;<br/><br/>The estimated value of the proposed contract is $11,500,000.00.  The proposed contract will not include an option provision.<br/><br/>4.  Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source,  as implemented by FAR 6.302 1.<br/><br/> <br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:<br/><br/>	a. FAR 6.302-1 is deemed applicable for this requirement as only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements.  <br/><br/>	b. A procurement of spares as listed herein is required to maintain interchangeability of existing assets and to ensure that critically needed spare parts are available to stock the Small Arms Readiness Evaluation Team (SARET).  The SARET assists deploying units with Small Arms RESET by providing repair parts and by inspecting and repairing small arms.  The SARET mission will take on the additional requirement to inspect and repair/replace the M145 MGO; therefore, a critical need exists to stock inventory with appropriate M145 MGO spare parts. <br/><br/>	c. Spare parts listed in paragraph 3, above, are unique to the M145 Machine Gun Optic (MGO).  The design of the M145 MGO is proprietary to Raytheon Canada Limited ("ELCAN").  The Government does not have the technical data or any production rights.  It is not cost effective for the Government to reverse engineer these items.  Such an effort would require measuring and documenting dimensions of these ten parts, cost an estimated $465,000 over a twenty two (22) month period and require the creation of 3D models and drawings. Beyond that, production set up, validation testing, initial production, first article testing and reliability testing would consume an additional thirty one (31) months and require an estimated outlay of $722,400.  Any potential cost savings to be found from pursuing other Commercial, Off the Shelf (COTS) solutions in a competitive arena are outweighed by the overall estimated outlay in excess of $1,187,400.00 over a 53 month effort.<br/><br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  The procurement action will be synopsized in FedBizOpps to alert interested contractors and subcontractors.<br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Competition will not increase as long as ELCAN M145 MGO's remain fielded. Because of the need to provide life-cycle spares to the M145 MGO, Elcan will continue to be the sole source provider for spares that directly support the ELCAN M145 MGO.<br/><br/>8.  Market Research:  Market Research was conducted on 30 April 2008 by ARDEC engineers, located at Rock Island, to determine if other commercial items or non-developmental items are available to meet the Government's needs or could be modified to meet the Government's needs. The ARDEC Engineers are inherently familiar with this item, and are regarded as subject matter experts in relation to item comparisons, capabilities, and marketplace conditions.  Although there may be other commercial solutions which could meet the requirement of the M145 MGO, the extended schedule and cost associated with qualifying a new contractor makes this option prohibitive.  Such an effort would require measuring and documenting dimensions of these ten parts, cost an estimated $465,000 over a twenty two (22) month period and require the creation of 3D models and drawings. Beyond that, production set up, validation testing, initial production, first article testing and reliability testing would consume an additional thirty one (31) months and require an estimated outlay of $722,400.  Any potential cost savings to be found from pursuing other Commercial, Off the Shelf (COTS) solutions in a competitive arena are outweighed by the overall estimated outlay in excess of $1,187,400.00 over a 53 month effort.  In addition, in order to maintain interchangeability with existing assets, it is recommended that the M145 an associated spare parts be procured from the current contractor, ELCAN.<br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources: To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in writing. The notices required by FAR 5.201 will be published and any proposals received shall be considered.<br/><br/>10.

Contracting Agency:  <br/><br/>U.S. Army TACOM Contracting Center, Rock Island, IL  61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action: <br/><br/>This action will result in a firm-fixed price contract with Sage International Ltd., 3991 East Eberhardt, Oscoda, Michigan, 48750.  Award is projected for the 4th Quarter FY09 and FY07 Weapons and Tracked Combat Vehicle (WTCV) funds will be used.<br/>An acquisition plan is not required because it does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan. <br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:<br/><br/>	a. Original - Proposed contract action is to procure 1,075 each, Aluminum Chassis Stock with telescoping butt stock with adjustable cheek rest and butt pad (butt-stock) for use on the M14 Enhanced Battle Rifle-Rock Island (EBR-RI), - Manufacturer Part Number B009042.  The estimated value is $967,500.00.  The proposed contract will not include an option provision.  <br/><br/>	b. Revised - Proposed contract action is to procure 700 each, Aluminum Chassis Stock with telescoping butt stock with adjustable cheek rest and butt pad (butt-stock) for use on the M14 Enhanced Battle Rifle-Rock Island (EBR-RI), - Manufacturer Part Number B009042.  The estimated value is $630,000.00.  The proposed contract will not include an option provision.  <br/><br/> <br/>4.  Authority Cited:  No Change<br/><br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited: As authorized by FAR 6.302 1, procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary as only one responsible source can satisfy agency requirements. <br/><br/>a.	Sage International Ltd. is the only manufacturer able to produce and deliver production quantities within the time frame required. Under their current contract, Sage International Ltd. is in production of and delivering production quantities of the M14 EBR-RI butt-stock. Sage International Ltd is scheduled to complete deliveries under their current contract by the end of July 2009 and is the only source that would not require verification testing to ensure the butt-stock meets current requirements for the M14 EBR-RI. Sage has a patent license for the design of the EBR butt-stock. However, while the Government has a right to use the existing Navy patent, the Government does not have a manufacturing technical data package. Sage created the drawing and technical data for the design and the Government does not have these drawings. Currently a small arms team produces the M14 EBR-RI at TACOM-Rock Island. The quantity of 700 each butt stocks are required to be delivered before October 2009 in order to avoid a break in production of the M14 EBR-RI. <br/><br/>b.	This procurement will be utilized to address a lack of operational capability of deployed forces in the field in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and is in support of various "Operational Needs Statements," (ONSs), which were submitted per various memorandums from Combatant Commanders in the field. Due to the classified nature of these documents a majority of the memorandums as well as actual ONS cannot be attached; however, these memorandums are available via SIPERNET given the proper security clearance. The current ONSs authorizes a total quantity of 5,000 each M14 EBR-RI; each M14 EBR-RI requires one butt-stock.  A majority of the ONS requirement for butt-stocks have been satisfied utilizing an existing Navy Contract awarded to Sage International Ltd. (see paragraph 10 below). The Navy contract has since been exhausted requiring the balance of 700 each butt-stocks to be procured from Sage International to avoid a break in production.<br/><br/>c.	The Government does not currently possess a Technical Data Package (TDP) for the butt-stock. The Government is currently developing a competitive TDP which is scheduled to be completed 30 September 2009.<br/><br/><br/>	  In February 2009, while development of a competitive TDP 	  	  was in process, notification that the original 		 	  	  Operational Needs Statement (ONS) quantity for the M14 	  	  EBR-RI had increased. The requirement increase was not 		  anticipated at time of award for contracts listed in 	     	  section 10 of original Justification and Approval.<br/><br/>d.	The Government must receive production quantities by October 2009 in order to avoid a break in production of the M14 EBR-RI. The time associated with conducting a competitive procurement requires the Government to pursue a sole-source purchase to Sage International for the remaining authorized ONS quantities. Based on the below Milestone chart the Government estimates receipt of production deliveries from a competitive proposal awarded to a non-incumbent contractor of May 2010. This date far exceeds the requirement of receipt of production quantities by October 2009 to avoid a break in production. Any requirements in excess of the 5,000 authorized ONS, if authorized, will be competed utilizing the Government TDP. <br/><br/>	<br/><br/>e.	The Competitive Milestone Chart is revised to reflect availability of Technical Data in September 2009. The time associated with undertaking a competitive or brand name or equal procurement would lead to unacceptable delays in the production of the M14 Enhanced Battle Rifle-Rock Island (EBR-RI). Additionally, in order to maintain functionality and interchangeability of assets sole-source procurement to Sage International is recommended. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>COMPETITIVE MILESTONE CHART				COMPLETION DATE<br/><br/>Receipt of Technical Data				30 Sep 2009<br/>Development of Solicitation Package		30 Nov 2009<br/>Issuance of Solicitation 				07 Dec 2009<br/>Closing of Solicitation 					07 Jan 2010<br/>Completion of proposal analysis    		22 Jan 2010<br/>Award of Contract						05 Feb 2010<br/>First Article Test Completion				14 May 2010<br/>Receipt of initial production quantities 	15 Jun 2010<br/> <br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  No change<br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Availability of Technical Data Package has changed from June 2009 to 30 September 2009. Technical Data is available for the EBR Butt-stock but has not been certified and has not completed verification and performance testing. A proven technical data package will not be completed and available until 30 September 2009. This procurement will be a one-time purchase of production quantity. Any future requirements will be procured utilizing full and open competition procedures utilizing the Government TDP.<br/><br/>8.  Market Research:  No Change<br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources: Troy Industries is a possible source of supply for the M14 EBR-RI butt-stock however has not been in production of the butt-stock. Troy, along with any other possible source of supply, would be required to pass stringent first article testing and acceptance requirements. As previously stated production quantities must be received by October 2009 in order to avoid a break in production of the M14-EBR. Critical Dimensions LLC has expressed interest in writing via electronic mail in July 2009.<br/><br/>The notices required by FAR 5.201 have been published and any proposals received shall be considered.<br/><br/>10.  Other Factors: This Amendment is processed based on additional historical information gathered regarding technical data of the M14 EBR-RI butt-stock. Specifically that Sage International Ltd. has a license agreement and utilized this agreement to develop drawings for the M14 EBR butt-stock based off of a US Navy Patent. Additional information regarding the development of a competitive TDP has been added for informational purposes.<br/><br/>11.

Contracting Agency:  U.S. Army TACOM Contracting Center, Rock Island, IL 61299 7630.<br/><br/>2.  Description of Action:  This action will result in a firm fixed price, 5-year, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with FN Manufacturing LLC (FN).  Award is projected for the 2nd Quarter FY 10 and Army Working Capital Funds (AWCF) will be used.  An acquisition plan is not required because it does not meet the dollar threshold for an acquisition plan.<br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  FN303 Firing Device, NSN: 1095-01-526-7860, Minimum Guaranteed Quantity is 1,500 each; Maximum Contract Quantity is 5,000 each. The estimated value is $3,815,000.00. The proposed contract will not include an option provision.<br/><br/>4.  Authority Cited:  10 USC 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.<br/><br/> <br/>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  As authorized by FAR 6.302 1, procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary as FN is the developer and sole manufacturer of the FN303. The FN303 is a non-lethal weapon utilized for crowd/riot control. A Government TDP is not available. No qualification procedures are available. According to ARDEC Engineering, to establish qualification procedures as required by the FAR to compete this item would result in an estimated engineering cost of approximately $50,000 and consume approximately 18 months of effort.  Additionally, reverse engineering would consume approximately 48 months and cost approximately $4,000,000. <br/><br/>In order to maintain functionality and interchangeability with existing assets, sole source procurement for FN is necessary. Failure to maintain interchangeability and functionality may result in failure of function of the FN303, thus resulting in harm to the user.<br/><br/>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  This procurement action was synopsized on October 22, 2009 in the FedBizOpps to alert interested contractors and subcontractors.<br/><br/>7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  Due to prohibitive cost to develop a competitive Technical Data Package, no further actions are being taken. Future requirements will be publicized via FedBizOps.<br/><br/>8.  Market Research:  Market research was conducted on May 12, 2009 by the Government Engineer specifically assigned to this project. The resources included colleagues who are experts in the small arms manufacturing, design and acquisition. The research resulted in a determination that these items are Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) involving proprietary technology unique to FN and no other product(s) meets the same need to maintain interchangeability.  <br/><br/>9.  Interested Sources: To date, no other sources have expressed an interest in writing. The notices required by FAR 5.201 have been published and any proposals received shall be considered.  <br/><br/>10.

As delineated in the VAAR 819.7007 and pursuant to 38 U.S.C.  8127(c), contracting officers may use other than competitive procedures (including sole source awards) for contracts to SDVOSBs and [Veteran-Owned Small Businesses] VOSBs where the anticipated award price will exceed the Simplified Acquisition Procedures threshold but not to exceed $5,000,000.  Each related award must be made to a responsible SDVOSB or VOSB at a fair and reasonable price as determined by the contracting officer.

<DESC>The J&A  extends the contract with American Overseas Marine (AMSEA), on a sole source basis, for a period of six months under the provisions of 52.217-8.  The price for the extended period was not evaluated for the contract award. The basis for the sole source extension is FAR 6.302-2, "Unusual and Compelling Urgency" and was necessitated by a stay in performance on the follow-on contract granted by the GAO in response to a protest filed by an unsuccessful offeror.  Due to the uncertainty of the outcome of the protest, to avoid a lapse in contract coverage, the Government requested and was granted authority to extend the contract for the operation and maintenance of seven Bob Hope class LMSRs for the period commencing 11 March 2010 and ending 10 September 2010 (the maximum allowable six-month period).  This contract provides personnel, operational and technical support ashore and afloat, equipment tools, provisions, and supplies to operate, maintain and repair the LMSRs which support the    readiness mission of the Department of Defense.  The Government has a critical need for the continuation of these ship operator services which support various military missions.
