However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> The explosion of social media and interactive internet services has revolutionized the Information Environment (IE), and fundamentally created a sensor system comprised of billions of citizens observing and reporting activities across the globe. Additionally, global actors, both state and non-state, are using the same interactive internet system to plan and coordinate activities across the spectrum of operations. Essentially, the internet has become a ubiquitous Command and Control (C2) and sensor system that impacts the United States (US) and its allies' missions around the globe, including Shaping activities, force protection, counter-terrorism, counter-Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), and a myriad of others. <br /><br />In response, the Government has established the Secure Unclassified Network (SUNet): an off-Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN), For Official Use Only (FOUO)-accredited unclassified platform to enable the Department of Defense (DoD), US Government Interagency, and Coalition Partners to securely collaborate and share Publicly Available Information, FOUO data, analytics, and other enterprise services. This platform enables mission partners to establish virtual enclaves, control access to those enclaves, and to acquire, develop, and deploy mission-specific data sets and analytics that can be shared across multiple enclaves or restricted based on mission requirements.<br /><br />The objective of this effort is to manage, develop, enhance, integrate, test, deploy, and maintain the SUNet system infrastructure, as well as develop and implement SUNet enclaves for mission-specific requirements utilizing Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) products with new data and collaboration features across US Government and foreign partner communities of interest. The Government anticipates the duration of the contract to be five (5) years.<br /><strong><br />PURPOSE:</strong> The intent of this Pre-Solicitation Synopsis is to verify the security clearance information of interested offerors and to develop an "Interested Parties List" to be used in the development of this acquisition.<br /><strong><br />SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:</strong> Security Clearance Eligibility - This notification provides the advanced opportunity for all potential offerors to submit their current clearance information for verification, prior to the official solicitation period. Those offerors who can confirm their eligibility of meeting the security requirements for this effort in advance of the official solicitation release will be eligible to participate in the draft and/or formal solicitation process upon verification. <strong>In order to be eligible to participate in the draft solicitation process, offerors must submit their security clearance information by no later than 15 days after posting of synopsis. All potential offerors' security information must be verified prior to being provided a copy of the draft solicitation, and submitting security information by 15 days after posting of synopsis does not guarantee a potential offeror's participation in the draft solicitation process. In order to participate in the formal solicitation, as well as allow the offeror to take advantage of the full formal solicitation posting time frame, it is strongly recommended that offerors submit their clearance information by no later than 15 days after posting of synopsis to allow for clearance verification to take place in time for the anticipated formal solicitation release date.<br /></strong><br />Offerors must have a valid U.S. facility clearance of Top Secret, Secret storage capability, and have technical personnel with Top Secret/ Special Compartmented Information (SCI) Clearance in order to have access to details under this draft and/or formal solicitation process. In order for this information to be verified, the offeror must provide the following:<br /><br />(1) Company name and address, <br />(2) Contact information for their Facility Security Officer,<br />(3) CAGE code for their Top Secret Facility Clearance, and<br />(4) The name, social security number and email address of one (1) of their Top Secret/Special Compartmented Information (SCI) cleared technical personnel.<br /><br />Due to security clearance verification, responses to this notice are strongly recommended by NLT 15 days after posting of synopsis, at 5:00 PM EST, in order to allow for offerors to take full advantage of the formal solicitation posting time frame.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute on Aging (NIA) intends to negotiate, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, on a noncompetitive, sole source basis, with Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland. <br />
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A solicitation document will not be issued, and proposals will not be requested. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statements or proposals received within this notice's response date will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to complete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) initiated amyloid PET imaging with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) in 2005 and tau PET imaging with AV-1451 (T-807) in 2016. Consistent with autopsy data from BLSA and other studies, approximately 30% of cognitively normal individuals have detectable amyloid deposition in the brain on PET-PiB imaging. Individuals with higher levels of &beta;-amyloid are older, more likely to carry the Apolipoprotein E &epsilon;4 allele, have greater longitudinal decline in memory and other cognitive functions, and are more likely to accumulate amyloid over time. In addition, through the BLSA autopsy program, we have shown the correspondence between in vivo imaging and post-mortem values of amyloid burden (13,18). Work by our group has been central to defining the relationship between amyloid burden and memory change (17,23), to characterizing the magnitude and spatial pattern of progression of amyloid burden (2,4,7,11,16), to highlighting the importance of individuals with intermediate amyloid levels that would be considered PiB negative in many binary classification schemes (7,16), and to identifying modifiers of amyloid burden (3,7,9,10,12,20,21). The NIA has also developed an approach for estimating age at onset of amyloid accumulation, providing an individualized index that can be used as a dependent outcome to assess factors that may modify age at onset of amyloid accumulation (4). This approach was applied to demonstrate that Apolipoprotein E &epsilon;4 genotype is associated with earlier age of onset of amyloid accumulation in the BLSA sample.</p>
<p>The BLSA was initiated in 1958 and is a multi-disciplinary study of physiologic and psychologic aspects of normal aging in community-dwelling men and women. Since 1994, the NIA has been conducting a longitudinal brain imaging study of selected older adults in the BLSA to characterize individual differences in longitudinal brain changes, to investigate the extent to which these brain changes underlie individual differences in cognitive aging, to identify brain changes that may be predictors of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to assess the impact of potential modulators of brain and cognitive aging. More recently, the NIA has been collecting in vivo measures of brain amyloid and tau, the hallmark pathologies of AD, using PET scanning.</p>
<p>The NIA intends to extend PET amyloid and tau studies to GESTALT (N=50 over 5 years) because BLSA and GESTALT include many overlapping assessments and participants are drawn from similar populations. This will allow the NIA to combine and analyze data across the two studies to increase power, while recognizing the relative strengths and weaknesses of each cohort. The increase in sample size will also result in an increased number of amyloid (and tau) positive individuals, who provide critical information on the earliest stages of preclinical AD.</p>
<p>With the more recent initiation of the NIA GESTALT study, NIA is extending these studies of cognitive and brain aging to a group of individuals undergoing deep phenotyping with respect to blood cell markers. The purpose of GESTALT is to perform deep phenotyping to identify biomarkers that change with aging in individuals who are initially healthy, independent of changes in specific PBMC cell types. The data collected in PBMCs will be compared to similar biomarker data obtained from muscle/fat and skin biopsies to understand to what extent biomarkers measured in the blood recapitulate similar changes that occur in different human tissues. These analyses will provide new insights into the biological nature of the aging process and how aging is associated with decline of both physical and cognitive function.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES:</p>
<p>The objective of this requirement is to extend these PET studies to GESTALT participants. A better understanding of "age-related" changes also requires definition of the various neuropathologies that accumulate in conjunction with advancing age. The Government collects detailed neuroimaging, as well as cognitive measures in both BLSA and GESTALT study participants. The Government acquire measures of regional brain volume (MPRAGE) and vascular lesion burden (T2, FLAIR), white matter integrity (DTI), and functional networks (resting state functional MRI). In a limited number of BLSA participants, we also acquire measures of amyloid and tau through PET molecular imaging and will extend these molecular imaging studies to GESTALT participants. In combination, the longitudinal assessment of these different modalities will provide insights into the neurobiological underpinnings of both disease- and age-related cognitive changes. This information will answer the question of whether accumulating neuropathologies fully account for age-related cognitive change or if there is some degree of age-related cognitive decline that is intrinsic to the aging process, i.e. "normal aging".</p>
<p>Specifically, the purpose is to acquire services to perform and quantify in vivo brain scans, including amyloid and tau neuropathology and regional cerebral blood flow, using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in GESTALT for analysis in combination with BLSA PET data. Studies of changes in amyloid deposition will be conducted using PET and 11C- Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) and studies of changes in tau pathology will be conducted using PET and 18F-T807 from Avid Pharmaceuticals (Lilly).</p>
<p>The following are two goals to satisfy NIA's objective fully:</p>
<p>1. Investigate changes in brain function and amyloid and tau burden as early biomarkers of cognitive decline and impairment including Alzheimer's disease.<br />2. Identify possible protective factors which prevent or delay the onset of cognitive <br />impairment in individuals who maintain normal cognition despite substantial amyloid and <br />tau burden.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>The Government will provide structural MRI scans and the Contractor shall perform PET 11C- PiB, and 18F-T807 scans and assist in sophisticated quantitative analysis of imaging data, using kinetic modeling techniques. The Contractor shall provide:</p>
<p>&bull; Assistance with scheduling the PET scan studies.<br />&bull; Assistance with preparation and review of regulatory documents, including materials to meet Institutional Review Board, FDA, and radiation safety regulatory requirements.<br />&bull; Radioisotope administration.<br />&bull; Medical monitoring of participants during PET scan procedures. <br />&bull; Provide parking coupon and lunch to research participants when necessary.</p>
<p>REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide monthly data transfer and calibration factors, and semi-annual and annual progress reports.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>One (1) year plus four (4) option years.</p>
<p>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:</p>
<p>(1) The Government is expected to use procedures in FAR Part 6.302-1 and (2) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541714 with a size standard of 1,000 employees.</p>

<SUBJECT>Port Orford Breakwater Interim repairs
<SOLNBR>W9127N19B0009
<CONTACT>Joshua D Fellwock, Contract Officer Representative, Phone 5038084398, Email joshua.d.fellwock@usace.army.mil
<DESC>Synopsis:  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineer (USACE) Portland District intends to solicit construction firms who are interested in submitting a competitive firm-fixed price bid for this project. This announcement is for the Interim Repair of the Port Orford Breakwater located at Port Orford, Curry County, OR.
<p>Project Scope: This project consists of the following:</p>
<p>Port Orford Breakwater Background: The breakwater sits on State owned land, but the breakwater is a real property asset of the Corps. The breakwater was authorized and constructed by the Corps in 1969 to protect the Port of Port Orford dock from wave action.  The breakwater has not been repaired since initial construction.  Waves and storm damage had damaged the breakwater in the center (location majority of winter waves and storms hit the structure), the armor stone had been knocked off the structure and it is currently unraveling in both directions. In 2012 ARRA funds were used to conduct a major maintenance report, which identified a preferred repair alternative. Since that time we have requested repair funds, and in 2017/2018 storm supplemental funds were received to conduct an interim repair (not the full rebuild identified in the MMR).  The storm supplemental funds were requested after a major storm in 2016 that accelerated the breakwater's unraveling.  If we do not repair the structure it will continue to unravel, resulting in continued loss of the federal infrastructure (increasing the cost to repair it), and the Port will continue to be subjected to increased wave action. Port Orford is a unique harbor in that there is no moorage in the water, boats must be hoisted out the water and stored on the dock.  Increased waves limit the available time to hoist boats in and out of the water, thereby decreasing the days available for the commercial fishing fleet to access the ocean, while increasing the risk of life and safety of the fleet. Currently the fishing fleet provides ~$3-5M in fish value to state annually.</p>
<p>Scope of Work: The Proposed Action is to perform an interim repair to the Port Orford breakwater by modifying its cross sections. The breach in the rubble mound breakwater will be filled to a crest height of +20 feet Mean Lower Low water [MLLW]. The width of the crest will be increased to 44 feet wide. The structure side slopes will remain as 1 vertical (V): 2 horizontal (H) on the seaward (west-facing) side and 1V:1.5H on the leeward (east-facing or harbor) side. Although the width of the crest will be increased, the structure will remain within the original design footprint of the 1969 breakwater. Required armor stone density is 170 pcf. Trucks or barges will be used to import and export construction material and equipment to the site. Scope is subject to change at the point of solicitation.</p>
<p>Two staging areas will be used to store equipment and materials at any given time during construction. The equipment staging area is located adjacent to the breakwater along Dock Road and the stone storage area is located above the Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) line on Port Beach.</p>
<p>Construction activities are anticipated to be completed within one summer season between May 1 and October 31, 2019.</p>
<p>Acquisition Strategy:  The solicitation will be an Invitation for Bid (IFB).  This acquisition will result in a single fixed-price contract. The agency will use Hubzone Price Evaluation preference in accordance with FAR 19.1307.</p>
<p>Magnitude of Construction:  The estimated cost of the project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.</p>
<p>Set Asides and Codes: This is a Full and Open acquisition.  This effort is classified through the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) under code 237990- Other Heavy Civil Engineering Construction.  The Small Business Standard size ($36.5M). The FSC is Z2K2 - Repair or Alteration of Other Conservation and Development Facilities.</p>
<p>Bid Procedures: The solicitation will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website, https://www.fbo.gov/, once it is issued. Firms are requested to register electronically to receive a copy of the solicitation when it is issued.</p>
<p>Bid Period: The solicitation is scheduled for release on or about 01 February 2019.  The tentative date for receipt of proposals is on or about 04 March 2019.</p>
<p>Plans and Specifications: The Plans and Specifications will also be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website, https://www.fbo.gov/, once it is issued.</p>
<p>System for Award Management (SAM): Offerors must register in the SAM at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ prior to submission of bids and prior to receiving an award.</p>
<p>Point of Contact:   The USACE-NWP Contracting Office will be the sole point of contact for this action.  E-mail responses to the Primary Point of Contact, Joshua D. Fellwock at joshua.d.fellwock@usace.army.mil.  E-mail is the preferred method for receiving responses to this pre-solicitation notice.</p>

<p>PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The United States Air Force, through the Legacy Tanker Division (AFLCMC/WKD) is issuing this sources sought synopsis, pursuant to FAR PART 10, as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement for the Joint Reliability and Maintainability System (J-RAMS) C/KC-135 Data Module (DM) (previously identified as the Long Term Health Management System (LtHMS)). The Government will use this information to determine the best future acquisition strategy for this procurement inclusive of the need to do an Industry day and/or Presolicitation Conference. The incumbent contractor will provide C/KC-135 DM specific J-RAMS familiarization and a copy of the Government-owned LtHMS software to the follow-on contractor after contract award.</p>
<p>The C/KC-135 DM is a web-based computer information/analysis tool that combines maintenance and supply information available from existing legacy systems into a single interface. It is a module of J-RAMS that was originally developed for Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) in 1998 to provide reliability, maintainability, and supportability data, along with analysis tools in one package. As presently fielded, the J-RAMS C/KC-135 DM consists of ten assessment tools including 1) Query Wizard (web-based guided query for weapon system information); 2) Automated Trigger Based Item Management (using Statistical Process Control to identify potential problem areas); 3) System Explorer (using Work Unit Codes (WUCs) as the discriminator to obtain data from the database); 4) an Automated Reports Generator; 5) Altimeter Data Viewer (analysis of aircraft altimeter accuracy); 6) Topcoat Inspection Manager (provides data collection, analysis, and reporting for topcoat inspection data); 7) Maintenance Process Analyzer (provides visual analysis of aircraft status and associated maintenance activity); 8) Fleet and Work Unit Code Dashboards; 9) Aircraft Availability Assessment Model; and 10) Flight Data Recorder Sensor Analyzer (provides verification of aircraft sensors).</p>

<SOLNBR>HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-SS-19-025 
<RESPDATE>010219
<CONTACT>Jon J Gottschalk, Contracting Officer, Phone 3014439456, Email jon.gottschalk@nih.gov
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes.  No award will be made as a result of this notice.  The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice.  This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background:  The longitudinal imaging project is part of a larger project called Foundational Data Initiative for Parkinson's Disease (FOUNDIN-PD). The FOUNDIN-PD project (https://www.foundinpd.org/) is a 2-year project (started mid 2018) and funded by the Michael J. Fox Foundation. The main goal of the FOUNDIN-PD project is the translation of genetic factors to a functional understanding of Parkinson's disease (PD) by unbiased data driven approaches. This will be performed by analyzing molecular phenotypes derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) lines differentiated to dopaminergic neurons with a broad range of genetic risk. These molecular phenotypes range from next generation sequencing of DNA and RNA of the iPS lines to longitudinal imaging of cultured cells.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to perform longitudinal imaging of dopaminergic neurons derived from Induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) cells of Parkinson's Disease patients and controls</p>
<p>Project requirements: Work will be performed by a Principle Investigator and a Senior Researcher identified by the Contractor. The Principle Investigator is responsible for supervision and oversight of work performed by the Senior Researcher and data analysis. The Senior Researcher will conduct laboratory work, including, cell-culture work and longitudinal imaging. Contractor will perform longitudinal imaging of Induces Pluripotent Stem (iPS) cells of Parkisnon's Disease patients and controls differentiated to dopaminergic neurons as provided by the Governement. Contractor will perform subsequent analysis using phenotypes such as: <br />&bull;	neurorite outgrowth, survival analysis and morphology as previously published by the contractor's lab.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance: We expect that the induced pluripotent stem (iPS) lines differentiated to dopaminergic neurons can be shipped to the contractor's facilities for longitudinal imaging. The estimated time to perform experiments is 1.5 years.</p>
<p>Other important considerations: <br />Level of Effort -- <br />Principle Investigator - estimated number of labor hours: 5 per week during the period of performance<br />Senior Researcher - estimated number of labor hours: 20 per week during the period of performance</p>
<p>Capability statement /information sought. Respondents must provide:</p>

<DESC>NAVSUP WSS Phila, is interested in developing sources to furnish effort including labor, material, and facilities as may be required to repair the items specified on the attached document. 

 

Currently absent interest by/approval of additional sources, the Government intends to negotiate a contract for this effort with the only approved source, Triumph, Yakima. Under the authority of FAR 6.301-1. Specifically, the government intends to award the attached items for a follow on BOA to N00383-16-G-010N. It should be noted by potential interested sources that the Government physically does not have in its possession sufficient, accurate, or legible data to contract repair with other than the only approved source.

While interested sources are invited to submit a source approval request, due to the Fleets need for the subject repair effort, the time required for approval of a new source is normally such that the contemplated award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
Submission of a source approval request, however, may enable an interested firm to become an approved source for a future procurement. 

 

If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP - WSS source approval Information Brochure for Repair. Additional information for submitted a source approval request package ban be obtained at:

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.
<p>The Open Period for January is January 1, 2019 to January 7, 2019, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2019 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 19-REG10 and must be located within Region 10.</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 17 years. Lease term may be further defined when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2018, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2019 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY19 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

This synopsis is exclusively for market research to determine the interest of qualified small business sources. Information gathered from market research may be used to assess the competitive environment, method of solicitation, type of contract, content of the solicitation, and for other planning purposes.
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong>Contract Type: </strong>The anticipated type of contract is a firm-fixed price type contract. The project method of delivery is a design-build program.</div>

GOVERNMENT QUESTIONS
The VA is requesting vendors answer the following questions in response to this notice.  
Are there any specifications for individual items that you believe may be too restrictive when taking into consideration industry standards (see draft Statement of Work)?  What specifications and why?
Are there any accessories for any equipment item that are normally separately priced?  What accessories?
Are there any items that you would recommend be purchased separately?  What items and why?
Is there any reason you would not be interested in responding to a solicitation?  What are the reason(s) and why?

Does your company manufacture the items in accordance with the Limitations on Subcontracting (see FAR section 52.219-14, 52.219-27 and 13 C.F.R. § 125.6) or supply the product of a small business made in the United States?
Do you have any questions or comments that may otherwise assist us?

SET-ASIDE
Complete responses to this notice will assist the VA in determining any potential set-aside for the requirement.  Not providing all information requested in response to this notice may result in the VA being unable to determine a vendor potentially capable of satisfying the requirement and, subsequently, if the  rule of two  criteria is not met, a specific set-aside category may not be decided by the Contracting Officer.


AUTHORIZED DEALER/DISTRIBUTOR VERIFICATION
Gray market items are Original Equipment Manufacturer s (OEM) goods sold through unauthorized channels in direct competition with authorized distributors.  This procurement is for new OEM medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment (i.e. replacement parts) for VA Medical Centers.  No remanufactures or gray market items will be acceptable.

The delivery of gray market items to the VA in the fulfillment of an order/award constitutes a breach of contract.  Accordingly, the VA reserves the right enforce any of its contractual remedies. This includes termination of the contract or, solely at the VA s election, allowing the Vendor to replace, at no cost to the Government, any remanufactured or gray market item(s) delivered to a VA medical facility upon discovery of such items.

This requirement is for new equipment ONLY; remanufactured or  gray market  items will not be accepted.   Gray market,  also known as parallel market is the trade of a commodity through distribution channels which, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer.

Any vendor interested in this requirement shall be an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) authorized dealer or distributor for the proposed equipment/system such that OEM warranty and services are provided and maintained by the OEM or that the OEM gives authorization to the vendor to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment on their behalf.  All software licensing, warrant, and service associated with the equipment/system shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.

To assist the VA in determining any potential set-aside, we are requesting vendors provide the authorized dealer/distributor letter in response to this Request for Information (RFI).  Any future solicitation will include the requirement for vendors to provide authorized dealer verification for all items of equipment.  To satisfy this requirement, the vendor shall provide the original documentation from the manufacturer stating they are an authorized dealer/distributor for the items being procured.  This letter shall be on the manufacturers  official letter head or from an official manufacturer  email and guarantees the products are safe, are not counterfeit or adulterated devices, have maintained adequate storage conditions, and that:

All product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or 
Guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the vendor to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment.  

An EXAMPLE of an acceptable OEM Authorized Dealer letter is attached (SEE ATTACHMENT 1). 

LIMITATIONS ON SUBCONTRACTING AND THE NON-MANUFACTURER RULE (NMR)

The requirement that a non-manufacturer supply the product of a small business concern is referred to
as the Non-Manufacturer Rule (NMR) [13 C.F.R. § 121.406]. In order to qualify as a small business
concern for a small business set-aside, an offeror must either manufacture the item in accordance with
the Limitations on Subcontracting (see FAR section 52.219-14, 52.219-27 and 13 C.F.R. § 125.6) or

This procurement is for new OEM medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment (i.e. replacement parts) for VA Medical Centers.  No remanufactures or gray market items will be acceptable.
 
Vendor shall be an OEM, authorized dealer, authorized distributor or authorized reseller for the proposed medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment (i.e. replacement parts), verified by an authorization letter or other documents from the OEM, such that the OEM s warranty and service are provided and maintained by the OEM.  All software licensing, warranty and service associated with the medical supplies, medical equipment and/or services contracts for maintenance of medical equipment shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.

The delivery of gray market items to the VA in the fulfillment of an order/award constitutes a breach of contract.  Accordingly, the VA reserves the right enforce any of its contractual remedies. This includes termination of the contract or, solely at the VA s election, allowing the Vendor to replace, at no cost to the Government, any remanufactured or gray market item(s) delivered to a VA medical facility upon discovery of such items.

This requirement is for new equipment ONLY; remanufactured or  gray market  items will not be accepted.   Gray market,  also known as parallel market is the trade of a commodity through distribution channels which, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer.

Any vendor interested in this requirement shall be an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) authorized dealer or distributor for the proposed equipment/system such that OEM warranty and services are provided and maintained by the OEM or that the OEM gives authorization to the vendor to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment on their behalf.  All software licensing, warrant, and service associated with the equipment/system shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.

To assist the VA in determining any potential set-aside, we are requesting vendors provide the authorized dealer/distributor letter in response to this Request for Information (RFI).  Any future solicitation will include the requirement for vendors to provide authorized dealer verification for all items of equipment.  To satisfy this requirement, the vendor shall provide the original documentation from the manufacturer stating they are an authorized dealer/distributor for the items being procured.  This letter shall be on the manufacturers  official letter head or from an official manufacturer  email and guarantees the products are safe, are not counterfeit or adulterated devices, have maintained adequate storage conditions, and that:

All product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or 
Guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the vendor to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment.  

An EXAMPLE of an acceptable OEM Authorized Dealer letter is attached (SEE ATTACHMENT 1).

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Recruitment Program, the Directorate of Human Resources, intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order to Career Communications Group Inc. for booth rentals at the BEYA Conference Feb 7, 2019 to Feb 9, 2019 in Washington, DC. Every year, USACE attends and is represented at multiple conferences.
<p>No competition is being sought. At many of these conferences, the purchase of the booth rental acts as the conference registration or the conference space has a vendor the attendee(s) must use for booth rental. These booth rentals are unique to Career Communications Group Inc.</p>
<p>Each year, thousands of minority STEM students participate in the BEYA STEM Conference. These college student participants typically have a GPA of 3.5 or higher. More than two-thirds of these attendees are college juniors and seniors with concentration in the areas of science, chemical, mechanical and electrical engineering, biotechnology and computer information systems. During the conference, students take part in seminars, interactive workshops and a career fair. These events allow participating organizations to expand their relationships within minority communities, recruit accomplished minority students in STEM fields, increase their organization's visibility within minority circles, and solidify their organization's reputation as an employer of choice. The conference provides an effective means of simplifying minority recruiting and other diversity and inclusion efforts.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations.<br />(a) Any response to this synopsis/solicitation will be considered a "quotation". <br />"Offer" means a response to a solicitation that, if accepted, would bind the offeror to perform the resultant contract. Responses to invitations for bids (sealed bidding) are offers called "bids" or "sealed bids"; responses to requests for proposals (negotiation) are offers called "proposals"; however, responses to requests for quotations (simplified acquisition) are "quotations," not offers.<br />Quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />(b) When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing, as defined at 2.101. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.<br />(c) If the Government issues an order resulting from a quotation, the Government may (by written notice to the supplier, at any time before acceptance occurs) withdraw, amend, or cancel its offer. (See 13.302-4 for procedures on termination or cancellation of purchase orders.)<br />System for Award management (SAM)<br />Offerors must be registered on the Systems for Award Management database (SAM). Information concerning SAM requirements may be viewed via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ or by calling the SAM Registration Centers at 866-606-8220. Only contractors who are registered in the Systems for Award Management (SAM) can be awarded a contract. Offerors must have electronic funds transfer (EFT) capability. Offerors proposals shall be valid for a minimum of 30 days to be acknowledged in the offerors proposal.</p>
<p>ANTI-TERRORISM TRAINING</p>
<p>Contractor must be able to provide the below training certificates within Seven (7) business days after award and before commencement of work. Certificates must be provided to the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) along with copies sent to the Contracting Officer and Contract Specialist.</p>
<p>AT Level I Training. This provision/clause/contract text is for contractor employees with an area of performance within an Army controlled installation, facility or area. All contractor employees, to include subcontractor employees, requiring access to Army installations, facilities and controlled access areas shall complete AT Level I awareness training within 10 calendar days before contract start date. The contractor shall submit certificates of completion for each affected contractor employee and subcontractor employee, to the COR and to the Contracting Officer, within 3 calendar days after completion of training by all employees and subcontractor personnel. AT Level I awareness training is available at the following website: https://atlevel1.dtic.mil/at.</p>
<p>iWATCH Training. This standard language is for contractor employees with an area of performance within an Army controlled installation, facility or area. The contractor and all associated sub-contractors shall brief all employees on the local iWATCH program (training standards provided by the requiring activity ATO). This local developed training will be used to inform employees of the types of behavior to watch for and instruct employees to report suspicious activity to the COR. This training shall be completed within 3 calendar days of the training event start date (NLT 26 September 2018), with the results reported to the COR and KO before contract commencement.</p>
<p>Contracting Manpower Recording Act (CMRA): The contractor shall report ALL contractor labor hours (including subcontractor labor hours) required for performance of services provided under this contract for the ARMY collection site as described in this associated PWS. The contractor shall complete Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) in accordance with the requirements outlined in the PWS.

<p>Unit Identification Code (UIC) for the Requiring Activity: W8BAAA</p>
<p>Issuing Office DoDAAC: W912JV<br />Discussions: The Government intends to evaluate quotes/offers and make award without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a). Therefore, the offeror's initial quote/offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price standpoint. Do not assume you will have the opportunity to clarify, discuss or revise your quote/offer. Offerors may, at the discretion of the Government, be asked to provide more information and clarification regarding their offer/quote. Request for such information does not constitute discussions. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Note: Executive Order (EO) 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal<br />Contractors, applies to all contracts subject to the Service Contract Act for which<br />the contract is awarded (and any solicitation was issued) on or after January 1,<br />2017. If this contract is covered by the EO, the contractor must provide employees<br />with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work, up to 56 hours of paid<br />sick leave each year. Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their<br />own illness, injury or other health-related needs, including preventive care; to<br />assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is ill,<br />injured, or has other health-related needs, including preventive care; or for<br />reasons resulting from, or to assist a family member (or person who is like family<br />to the employee) who is the victim of, domestic violence, sexual assault, or<br />stalking. Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections<br />under the EO is available at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.48 per hour or $179.20 per week or $776.53 per month</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE EO 13706: $4.18 per hour, or $167.20 per week, or $724.53 per<br />month*</p>
<p>*This rate is to be used only when compensating employees for performance on an SCA-<br />covered contract also covered by EO 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal<br />Contractors. A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA obligations for any<br />paid sick leave provided pursuant to EO 13706.</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor, 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **</p>
<p>An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as<br />screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives,<br />and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.<br />All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization,<br />modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive<br />ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading<br />and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like;<br />minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used. All<br />operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1),<br />dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE, Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF-1444) **</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR<br />4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor<br />prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final<br />determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which<br />shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day<br />of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure<br />to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested<br />parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the<br />date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act<br />and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are<br />included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage<br />determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the U.S.<br />Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy<br />of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See<br />29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties<br />requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage<br />determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1)).<br />Point of Contact:</p>
<p>Offerors can submit their proposal to: Richard Harvey at <br />Richard.a.harvey5.civ@mail.mil or Phone at 503-584-3773.</p>
<p>Please verify that we received your proposal.</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineering Research and Development Center - Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (ERDC-CERL) in Champaign, IL has a requirement for a Bacteriophage Rapid Anthrax Viability Evaluation System (BRAVES) Prototype. The specifics of the requirement are as follows:</p>
<p>1) Ruggedized carrying cases for each of the following methods kits. The method kits (a-c) shall be designed to process samples at a rate of 1,000 samples per day by a single operator and include enough consumable materials for processing 1,000 samples. The prototype kits (a-c) and their components shall have a shelf life of at least 1 year.</p>
<p>a) Collection Method Kit. Equipment and supplies for collecting anthrax samples from soil, plywood, concrete, and non-porous surfaces, to include surface swabs, surfactant-buffer solutions, collection/extraction tubes, and any other required materials for the collection method.<br />b) Processing Method Kit. Equipment and supplies for processing collected samples using the phage reporter method, to include growth reactors, stabilized phage inoculum, germination and growth media, shaking incubator, and any additional materials required for the processing method.<br />c) Analysis Method Kit. Equipment and supplies for analyzing samples using the phage reporter method, to include 96-well plates for bioluminescence readings, stabilized calibration standards based on Bacillus anthracis delta Sterne strain or other non-pathogenic spores that respond to the method, background controls, chemical solutions, a luminometer with auto-injection capability, and any additional materials required for the analysis method.</p>
<p>2) An operations manual for the system with intuitive graphical tutorials for the method, and also including logistics requirements and materials specifications.</p>
<p>3) A video demonstrating the use of the system, covering each step in the method.</p>
<p>4) An Excel file for importing, interpreting, and storing data in an efficient manner.</p>
<p>Delivery of the prototype to ERDC-CERL is required no later than 6 months after award.</p>
<p>ERDC-CERL intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to Guild Associates in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).</p>
<p>Market research indicates that Guild Associates, Inc. is the only source for this requirement because they hold and have developed a patent for phage reporter technology which encompasses a high-throughput method for anthrax viability analysis. This method uses anthrax-specific bacteriophage that are genetically modified to induce bioluminescence within viable anthrax. They are the only company with the trade secrets necessary to generate and propagate these bacteriophage. This method provides rapid signal detection, and employs smaller and more efficient equipment than other current methods. The capabilities that Guild possesses as the developer of this unique technology makes them the only viable source for development of a system that will meet the government's requirement for rapid and high volume anthrax detection. The system shall be designed according to the specifications listed above, and Guild Associates is the only source able to provide these specifications.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 which has a size standard of 1000 employees. This is not a small business set aside.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement. Any interested party that believes they can fulfill this requirement should submit a capability statement to be reviewed. All submissions will be considered, however there is no guarantee that submissions in response to this notice will be in any way alter the Government's acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>Please provide responses to this notice no later than the Response time listed above in this notice, to:<br />CERL-CT_QUOTES@usace.army.mil</p>
<p>Telephone responses will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice will not be considered as a response to any solicitation, a request to be added to a prospective offers list, or to receive a copy of any solicitation.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>(2) Through another subsidiary of a parent corporation.</p>
<p>(b) If the contractor reorganizes as an inverted domestic corporation or becomes a subsidiary of an inverted domestic corporation at any time during the period of performance of this contract, the Government may be prohibited from paying for Contractor activities performed after the date when it becomes an inverted domestic corporation or subsidiary. The Government may seek any available remedies in the event the Contractor fails to perform in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract as a result of Government action under this clause.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions to this prohibition are located at 9.108-2.</p>
<p>(d) In the event the Contractor becomes either an inverted domestic corporation, or a subsidiary of an inverted domestic corporation during contract performance, the Contractor shall give written notice to the Contracting Officer within five business days from the date of the inversion event.</p>

In determining whether dominance exists, consideration shall be given to all appropriate factors, including volume of business, number of employees, financial resources, competitive status or position, ownership or control of materials, processes, patents, license agreements, facilities, sales territory, and nature of business activity.</p>
<p>(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:</p>
<p>(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.</p>

If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. This can be accomplished through informal discussion between the interested party and the Contracting Officer. During the course of such discussions Contracting Officers shall ensure that the Chief of the Contracting Office (COCO) remains informed of all issues and developments as they occur. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns of the interested party, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protest through the Ombudsman Hotline at (202) 372-3695. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirements for filing an agency protest or protest with another forum. <br />Interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />Assured Supply for Soft Ballistic Material Manufacturing</p>
<p>United States Army, Program Executive Office Soldier Program Manager Soldier Personal Protective and Individual Equipment</p>
<p>1.0 Description: The U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey-Emerging Technologies Contracting Center (ACC-NJ-ET), Benet Laboratories, on behalf of the Program Manager Soldier Protective and Individual Equipment (PM SPIE) of the Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060 is requesting information on current domestic (US/Canada) capable manufacturers for the creation and/or development of domestic infrastructure to support improved Soft Armor Ballistic Insert (SABI) material and for commercial applications as well as those applications required for the US Department of Defense (DoD) needs. The offeror(s) will demonstrate how they can provide specific implementation opportunities and information that contributes towards further development of manufacturing and production technologies and increase the capacity of the domestic critical infrastructure and frameworks needed for production of lighter and higher performing personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>
<p>1.1 NAICS: The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) identifiers include: 315990 Apparel Accessories and Other Apparel Manufacturing.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, PM SPIE is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Offerors are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any are issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>
<p>2.1 The Problem: The U.S. Army has a need to deliver lighter and higher performing personal protective equipment (PPE) to the Soldier thereby increasing survivability and mobility. The Army has developed a next generation protection system called Soldier Protection System Torso and Extremity Protection (SPS TEP). The SPS TEP design consists of four (4) components: Modular Scalable Vest (MSV), Ballistic Combat Shirt (BCS), Blast Pelvic Protector (BPP), and Ballistic Battle Belt (B3). The SPS TEP allows Soldiers to tailor load and protection from Tier 1, Concealable, to Tier 4, Full Tactical. Improvements in low weight, high strength soft ballistic armor materials are the key to realizing further weight reduction while maintaining performance levels of Soft Armor Ballistic Inserts (SABI) that protect the Soldier from a full spectrum of threats. Currently the Government has an estimated near term requirement of at least 100,000 SABI and intermediate term requirement for at least 710,000 SABIs that will be produced as part of an anticipated five (5) year procurement contract. Non-U.S. competitors are challenging U.S. leadership in technology and production threatening the ability of U.S. companies to capitalize the market-driving technologies of the future and degrades U.S. national security. The current set of incentives offered by the U.S. can be better aligned to retain domestic capacity and leadership PPE.</p>
<p>2.2 Cost of Inaction: Other nations will innovate faster, capture market share, and obtain the best technology leaving the U.S. without a superior, domestic innovation and manufacturing base. The U.S. may lose the ability to realize the best ideas and capabilities across commercial and defense sectors, becoming dependent on competitor nations. A reliance on foreign-made SABI material with inferior quality and limited availability could increase risk to Soldiers.</p>
<p>2.3 Outcome Sought: DoD seeks to avoid these potentially disastrous outcomes, by assuring that the U.S. is the preferred global source for developing superior technologies faster, more efficiently, and with the highest levels protective properties. The U.S. retains and will leverage its existing infrastructure to advance SABI material development, supporting multiple domestic and DoD ecosystems providing services from material development, to component design, and integration in PPE systems.</p>
<p>Domestic development and production capabilities will drive and support these activities, sustaining leadership in translating leading-edge, advanced technology (RD&amp;D) into new products. Critical technology advancements in unique material properties, decreased areal density, improved ballistic performance, and SABI manufacturability will benefit the PPE by enabling products that are differentiated from foreign competitors by their increased performance and weight savings. Thus, DoD requirements can provide direct market incentives for assured products that U.S. commercial partners are uniquely positioned to provide.</p>
<p>3. DoD Actions and Requests: DoD recognizes the need to proactively engage with industry to make these efforts successful in delivering SABI technologies and providing value to the industrial base. DoD is executing a plan to provide SABI leadership now and into the future with a whole-of-government effort. PM SPIE is requesting information on behalf of the DoD on how to achieve the above goals most effectively. Offerors are encouraged to provide their perspective, input, and ideas for the structure and sustainability of their manufacturing capability, from RD&amp;D to production, ensuring DoD access to the capabilities it needs from domestic sources while providing value to industry through market-differentiating advantages. Sections below provide details of the response content and structure.</p>
<p>4. Technical approach: The offeror will provide an outline of the technical approach and describe capacity that could be made available immediately, 1-2 years, and through scalability over the next 3-5 years along with the associated Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) unit cost of the material in terms of cost per pound at the volumes proposed. Provide justification for how this approach meets the national innovation and DoD requirements for long term, economically viable, and assured SABI material supply across commodity and advanced specialized technologies. The business case should consider acquisition or access costs, capacity reservations or other purchase guarantees, annual operation and support costs, ownership, foreign ownership, control or influence (FOCI) concerns, support for low volume/high mix production, and the ability of the business to address US innovation and DoD special requirements and/or the diversity of its requirements.</p>
<p>5. Technical Objectives: In order to realize a significant SABI improvement, the following factor performance objectives have been developed. A description of an offeror's current values and suggestions for further improvement over the values listed in the table below, based on state-of-the-art materials, should be proposed. Material developed will be tested as SABI shoot packs to assess performance.</p>
<p>Factor - Areal Density (nonconsolidated)<br />Threshold - 0.75 lbs/ft2<br />Objective- 0.65 lbs/ft2</p>
<p>Factor- 9-mm, 124-gr Full Metal Jacket<br />Threshold- 1525 ft/s<br />Objective- 1750 ft/s</p>
<p>Factor- 17-grain V50 Fragment Simulating Projectiles (FSP)<br />Threshold- 1850 ft/s<br />Objective- 2550 ft/s</p>
<p>Factor- Maximum Back Face Deformation<br />Threshold- 44mm</p>
<p>Factor- Material Production Capacity<br />Threshold- 500,000 pounds per year<br />Objective- 5 Million pounds per year <br /><br />6. Cost/Funding Estimates and Methods: Provide a top-level break out of estimated implementation costs and the financial and other business arrangements and incentives necessary to implement capability and sustain viability. Identify recommended type of investments (loans, loan guarantees, purchase commitments, grants and cost sharing needed (e.g., RD&amp;D, production scale-up, engineering costs, equipment purchase costs, and business development costs) that would be required for implementation to include funding from all sources with special consideration for commercial and private sectors.. The business case should consider the commercial viability (e.g., customer base, market position, revenues, and profitability) of resulting property, goods, or capital. Responses should also address the anticipated impacts of increased assurance necessary to differentiate US produced products over less secure alternatives for their existing customer base to include the DoD. Describe any other factors, including policy and regulatory actions, potentially impacting the long-term availability and access to the design, material manufacturing, and SABI production in a US domestic ecosystem.</p>
<p>7. Cost Share: As it is intended that the technology required to meet the estimated outputs provided herein be readily marketable, DoD anticipates that the offeror will contribute funding as cost share if awarded a contractual instrument with the DoD. It is estimated that the offeror would provide 50% cost share to the maximum extent practicable. Estimate the likely cost share of the investment industry. Any government investments and incentives are to position domestic firms to become commercially viable, obtain a market leadership position, and support the limited DoD needs for access and availability.</p>
<p>8.0 Responses</p>
<p>8.1 Interested offerors responses may be up to 10 pages (front and back, 12 point font in Times Roman), and include their basic company identification information, which SABI material(s) they produce domestically, the location where they produce it domestically, who they produce it for (e.g., Commercial,/Law Enforcement, Federal and State government), etc.) and the quantity they produce (e.g., annual output) for each User/application. Respondents may include other information they think pertinent but it should be kept separate from the one page response.</p>
<p>Note: Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. To aid the Government, please segregate proprietary information. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Responses will be reviewed only by US government personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.</p>
<p>8.2 Offerors are requested to respond to this RFI with a white paper.</p>
<p>8.3 White papers in Microsoft Word compatible or portable document format files are due no later than 18 January 2019, 12:00 EST. Responses shall be limited to 20 pages for Section 2 and submitted via e-mail only to giuseppe.tropiano.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>9 Industry Discussions: PM SPIE representatives may or may not choose to meet with potential offerors. Such discussions would only be intended to get further clarification of potential capability to meet the requirements, especially any development and certification risks.</p>
<p>10 Questions: Questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to Giuseppe Tropiano (giuseppe.tropiano.civ@mail.mil). Verbal questions will NOT be accepted. Questions shall NOT contain proprietary or classified information. The Government does not guarantee that questions received after 18 January 2019 will be answered.</p>
<p>11. Summary: This is a RFI only and meant to identify sources that can provide Assured Supply for Soft Armor Ballistic Insert (SABI) Material Manufacturing. The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. DoD has not made a commitment to procure any of the items discussed, and release of this RFI should not be construed as such a commitment or as authorization to incur cost for which reimbursement would be required or sought. All submissions become Government property and will not be returned.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">95332419E0001 Amendment 2<br />DCO TVS Abidjan Transport Project (ATP) A-E Service in C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire<br />Synopsis</div>
<p>Amendment 1</p>
<p>The purpose of Amendment 1 is to issue the updated ToR. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>
<p>[End of Amendment 1]</p>
<p>Amendment 2</p>
<p>The purpose of Amendment 2 is (1) to issue the details of the Synopsis Conference held on 27 November 2018, (2) to extend the Questions Due Date to 1:00pm ET on 4 January 2019 (Friday), and (3) to issue updated attachments. For the overview of the Conference, refer to the Synopsis Attachment f. Synopsis Conference Presentation. The highlights/questions from the synopsis are listed below in a form of questions and answers (Q&amp;As).</p>
<p>This Amendment also includes the following attachments: Unofficial Terms of Reference in French 20181218, Updated LoEs by Deliverables, and Unofficial Synopsis Conference Presentation. The Unofficial Terms of Reference in French and the Unofficial Synopsis Conference Presentation are for reference purpose only. If there are any discrepancies among the documents, the information from the Official Terms of Reference and the Synopsis supplant the unofficial documents.</p>
<p>All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Firms must acknowledge Amendments 1 and 2 in their Cover Letter. Firms may simply state, "Firm ABC acknowledges Amendments 1 and 2."</p>
<p>List of Synopsis Conference attendees:</p>
<p>a.	Atkins Acuity<br />b.	CP&amp;Y<br />c.	Egis Group<br />d.	ERM Group<br />e.	exp Global<br />f.	IMC Worldwide<br />g.	Ing&eacute;rop<br />h.	Jacobs Engineering Group<br />i.	Louis Berger Group<br />j.	Monkey Forest Consulting<br />k.	Mott MacDonald<br />l.	Rendel Limited<br />m.	SETEC<br />n.	Tetra Tech</p>
<p>Conference Questions and Answers (Q&amp;As):</p>
<p>1.	Would MCC consider extending the questions due date until the first week of January? Some of our international offices are closed until the first week.<br />A: Yes. The questions are now due by 1:00PM ET on 4 January 2019 (Friday).</p>
<p>2.	Would MCC consider extending the SF-330 submission due date?<br />A: Yes. The submissions are now due by 5:00p ET on 4 February 2019 (Monday).</p>
<p>3.	Would MCC consider cost plus incentive fee type contract?<br />A: No.</p>
<p>4.	Will MCC provide a Microsoft Word version of the SF-330 template?<br />A: No. The SF-330 is managed and distributed by US GSA and they only have a PDF version available. After the Synopsis was posted, the CS realized that the Attachments E. SF-330 Part I and Part II Templates were corrupt. We will attempt to re-upload in this Amendment 2. However in case the upload fails again, MCC encourages the interested firms to download the templates directly from the GSA website:</p>
<p>https://www.gsa.gov/reference/forms?search_keyword=sf-330</p>
<p>5.	How will MCC share any revised Synopsis Attachments?<br />A: MCC may update the Synopsis Attachments as needed and upload it as an Amendment on FBO.gov under this announcement 95332419E0001. Firms are required to reference and use the most up-to-date Attachments from the latest amendment for their submissions. Please periodically check the FBO announcement at the following link for any revised Attachments:</p>
<p>https://www.fbo.gov/spg/MCC/MCCMCC/MCCMCC01/95332419E0001/listing.html</p>
<p>6.	How should firms confirm that the submission is valid for one year?<br />A: Firms may simply note "The submission is valid for one year" in the Cover Letter.</p>
<p>7.	In the Synopsis Section 1. Background, what does it mean by "The estimated cost range for the construction project is to exceed $10,000,000"?<br />A: This is simply a prescribed set of ranges per FAR 36.204.</p>
<p>8.	Is an SF-330 Part II required for each office where key personnel reside?<br />A: Yes. SF-330 Part II is required for each office that will be involved in this project.</p>
<p>(The complete SF-330 template has a set of instructions on how to complete the form. On page 4 of Instructions, it says to submit SF-330 Part II for the firm and each of its "branch office seeking work if the firm has branch offices.")</p>
<p>9.	How soon does MCC expect to receive the top firm's cost proposal once the firms ranking is established?<br />A: Once the solicitation (RFP) is issued to the top firm, we will expect to receive the cost proposal in two weeks.</p>
<p>10.	What is the expected award date?<br />A: MCC hopes to make the award in March of 2019.</p>
<p>11.	Who does the MCC expect to be present at the presentation/interview?<br />A: The Team Lead must be present either in person or virtually (if virtually, she/he must have a reliable connection to communicate with MCC clearly). Ideally, MCC would like all the Key Personnel members to be present, but this is not required.</p>
<p>12.	General Format. Please confirm that use of 11x17" paper for charts, graphics, and matrices is approved, and will only count as a single page within the allotted page count.<br />A: Yes. Up to five 11x17" with 1" margins pages will be permitted in Section H Additional Information for charts, graphics, matrices, or any other visual representations. These pages shall not include extensive written descriptions of your technical approach (as a general rule of thumb, if these pages reserved for visuals include paragraphs of information, we will disregard them during our evaluation). Each 11x17" page will count as one page towards the 30-page limit.</p>
<p>13.	Are resumes only required for the six key personnel or do we need to include resumes for all personnel listed on the organizational chart?<br />A: The resumes must be submitted for both key and non-key personnel that are listed on the organizational chart.</p>
<p>14.	Format of CV. In the RFP Public meeting, MCC specified offerors do not have to follow the Section E resume template; rather, should ensure that the required information is included in the CVs provided. Please confirm this to be correct.  Also, please confirm there is no page limit, nor limit on number of CVs included in Section E. <br />A: That is correct. As long as the required information is included, Section E resume template is not required for submission. If Section E template is not used, the resumes shall be compiled and submitted as a separate electronic file, collective of all relevant resumes, on 8.5x11" paper with 1" margin. There is no page limit to resumes.</p>
<p>15.	Where in the SF-330 should firms incorporate the Commitment Letters?<br />A: You may include all the Commitment Letters as a separate attachment to the SF-330 Section E. Resumes of Key Personnel Proposed for this Contract. As a reminder, there is no page limit for Commitment Letters.</p>
<p>16.	Does MCC want a confirmation of the A-E firm's commitment to this project from an authorized officer of the firm?<br />A: Yes. The Cover Letter shall include a statement from an executive of the proposing firm confirming their commitment to actualizing the proposed and negotiated plans, including the team members. Firms may simply include a statement in the signed Cover Letter, "Firm ABC confirms the commitment of carrying out our proposed and any negotiated technical plans, including mobilizing and maintaining the proposed team members."</p>
<p>An attempt by the contractor to alter the technical plans after award may not be considered favorably by MCC and may result in a termination for default.</p>
<p>17.	Would MCC consider limiting the number of projects under SF-330 Section F. Example Projects which Best Illustrate Proposed Team's Qualifications for This Contract? How should firms reflect the multiple projects?<br />A: Yes. The total number of projects in Section F shall not exceed 10 projects. Firms must complete a copy of SF-330 Section F for each project proposed, i.e. if proposing 5 projects, the firm must complete the Section F five times, one for each project.</p>
<p>18.	Can firms provide past performance references of the subcontractors?<br />A: Yes. MCC expects at least three (3) past performance references of the prime firm. The firm may choose to submit additional past performance references of its subcontractors if they have performed similar projects, in size and scope, in the past.</p>
<p>19.	The Qualification Factor 4 asks for at least 3 past performance references in a format that differs from SF-330 Section F. Will MCC clarify this?<br />A: The Qualification Factor 4 has been revised to require at least 3 but no more than 10 past performance references to match the requires of SF-330 Section F (refer to Question no. 4 above). Firms must submit at least 3 references for the prime contractor. Firms may submit 1 or 2 references for each of its subcontractors and the total number of subcontractor references may not exceed 7 references.</p>
<p>The Qualification Factor 4 has been revised to reconcile SF-330 Section F.</p>
<p>20.	Would MCC consider limiting the SF-330 Section G. Key Personnel Participation in Example Projects to the proposed Key Personnel only?<br />A: Yes. The Section G may comprise of example projects participated by the proposed Key Personnel only.</p>
<p>21.	Section G. Section G states Key Personnel be included only in the matrix. Will MCC allow Key and other Core Technical Experts be included to illustrate experience level more appropriately?<br />A: The minimum requirement is to complete Section G of the proposed Key Personnel. However, firms are permitted to include other Core Technical Experts (no junior-level staff) in Section G to illustrate a more complete picture of its proposed team's professional qualifications. Doing so may result in a higher rating for the Evaluation Factor 1 Proposed team professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.</p>
<p>22.	Can firms re-phrase the Team's roles as stated in the ToR?<br />A: No. As noted under 5.b. Submission Requirements and Instructions, "A restatement of the ToR will be deemed unacceptable and may result in a low evaluation rating."</p>
<p>23.	How much of the contract would be performed before/after the Entry-into-Force (EIF)?<br />A: The EIF is the point in time when a Compact or Threshold Program Agreement comes into full legal force and effect and its term begins. MCC estimates the EIF may take place in middle of 2019, but there is no certainty as of now so we cannot estimated this performance split.</p>
<p>24.	What is MCC's expectations on the team mobilization plan?<br />A: The team mobilization plan shall demonstrate the proposed teams mobilization and timing to complete the assignment per the proposed workplan and overall approach and methodology. Firms shall consider, among other items, how the proposed team will be initially mobilized to Abidjan to begin the assignment in earnest.</p>
<p>25.	Subcontracting Plan. In an SF 330, a proper Subcontracting Plan is generally not included, due to the costing content required therein. Will MCC consider dropping this requirement for the SF 330 submission, until prior to negotiations at which time all costs, etc can be revealed?<br />A: MCC is not seeking a formal Subcontracting Plan with the cost information. MCC wishes to verify that the prime contract has a management plan on (1) how it will oversee the subcontractor's performance and (2) what its plans are in case of subpar performance.</p>
<p>26.	Page 7 of ToR, asks for the LoEs less administrative effort. There may be uneven comparison by removing the administrative effort.<br />A: We have changed this requirement to propose the Total Estimated LoE Percentage per Deliverable. Refer to the Attachment c. LoEs by Deliverable. We are no longer seeking a total number of hours per deliverable. The sum of all the LoE percentages (including the Base Period and Option Period 1) must equal 100% and shall reflect the total hours, including both technical and administrative hours, in the calculation.</p>
<p>27.	Is there a detailed contract deliverables review and approval process?<br />A: Yes, it can be found in the ToR Section 4. Deliverables and Documentation Requirements.</p>
<p>28.	Are firms permitted to propose cost-cutting and/or value engineering methods?<br />A: Yes. Firms may propose innovative cost-cutting and/or value engineering methods that can improve the Government's requirement in Section H. Additional Information. However, this synopsis phase is strictly a technical evaluation phase and SF-330 does not allow any cost information. Therefore, firms must take care not to submit any specific cost detail. General explanations of the methods are permitted but any numbers associated to cost or even inferences that can be made to any specific cost numbers are prohibited. MCC will not advise the firms whether or not their language would be permissible before the submission due date. Firms should consult the permissible language with their legal counsel.</p>
<p>29.	Would MCC consider giving a range for the expected number of team members? Firms could propose a very effective technical approach but it could be very expensive.<br />A: No. We want the interested firms to determine the most effective and efficient team structure.</p>
<p>30.	Would MCC consider providing a range of the estimated contract value? Providing some parameter would assist firms to better prepare the submission.<br />A: Periodically, MCC updates our Business Forecast on our website. According to our Forecast, the estimated contract value for this A-E service is between $10,000,000 and $20,000,000 (https://www.mcc.gov/resources/doc/eport-business-forecast-fy-2018-mid-year).</p>
<p>This is a pure estimate and does not bound interested firms to prepare a technical approach within this range. This information is strictly for referential purpose and not a strict requirement. MCC expects the firms to submit the best, realistic, and fair and reasonable technical submissions based on their own assessment of MCC's requirement.</p>
<p>31.	During the contract performance, it may be necessary for the contractor to access various areas of the project. What would happen if there are any accessibility issue?<br />A: If the said issue arises from the fault of the Government, we will absolutely consider modifying the contract for reasonable equitable adjustments. If the issue/delay could have been resolved or avoided by the contractor, any additional costs incurred would be assumed by the contractor.</p>
<p>32.	Has there been any further determination on the site of the truck parking?<br />A: The World Bank is currently conducting a study. The site detail has not yet been established.</p>
<p>33.	Regarding the Key personnel, the terms indicate the team leader should have led and manage two similar projects valued at 175 million USD each, which is fairly high threshold for projects dealing with urban networks requalification in developing countries; would any other relevant projects be considered in the evaluation of the team leaders if projects credentials are below that threshold, while still being significant for developing countries (for example: projects within the range of 75-80 million USD)?<br />A: No. But to clarify, the projects do not have to be from developing countries. The US$175 million is for any construction projects at such value. This is to ensure a team lead who have handled similar projects in size and scope as MCC's project.</p>
<p>34.	Regarding the key-experts and their presence on site, should we consider a minimum share of their man-days to be spent in Ivory Coast?<br />A: The firm shall propose how they anticipate staffing and maintaining the appropriate level of in country presence to complete the assignment.</p>
<p>35.	Some project activities might imply generating and selecting some preferred options regarding these projects, and the consultant's level of effort might vary depending on the option(s) that will be selected (for example: Option period 1, activity 2 : "To prepare preliminary designs for the four road projects"); it is our understanding that these variance in the level of efforts would be discussed at a future stage of the selection process, once the preferred technical proposal has been selected; can you confirm this?<br />A: Yes. MCC is open to negotiating points such as this with the highest rated firm(s) during the solicitation phase.</p>
<p>36.	In relation with Attachment c. Level of efforts by deliverables: it is our understanding that the total LOE estimation presented in that table will actually correspond to the total level of efforts of all activities specific to the deliverables; can you confirm our understanding? How would you recommend that LOE related to common tasks (such as project management, etc.) be considered?<br />A: LOE shall be presented for each deliverable as a percentage of the sum total of LOE for the Base and Option Period 1, including both direct and indirect (administrative) hours.</p>
<p>37.	Levels of Effort (LOEs): we understand that the total man-hours of personnel should be provided by deliverable; do we also include support staff (administrative) and surveys team (traffic counts, technical and socio-environmental investigations...)?<br />A: Please note the required LoEs by Deliverables spreadsheet now requires the percentage of total LoEs, instead of number of hours. The percentages are to be the absolute total, including support staff.</p>
<p>38.	The terms indicate the training sessions should be meant for groups of 30 to 50 attendees. Such a big group size may impact negatively the quality of the interaction and learning. Would it be possible to reconsider the size of the groups and to reduce them to 15 to 20 attendees or to expand the number of training sessions (i.e. more or less to double them) for that purpose?<br />A: MCC agrees the training would be more effective with smaller group size. MCC agrees that the class size shall not exceed 40 participants. MCC will evaluate the firms' approach on how they will implement the training sessions.</p>
<p>39.	The proposal evaluation factors and criteria are very clear; in addition, how will the relative importance of each factor or criteria be assessed and evaluated, to produce the overall evaluation and ranking of the proposal?<br />A: MCC will use adjectival rating system per Synopsis Section 7. Evaluation Criteria. We will not use a numeric system to rank the important of the evaluation factors. Those firms that rate more highly on the more important factors, e.g. Professional Qualification, Methodology and Workplan, and Specialized Experience and Technical Competence, would be more favorable to MCC than those firms that rate more highly on the less important factors, e.g. Past Performance and Knowledge of the Locality.</p>
<p>40.	Regarding the synopsis, English seems to be the working language. But based on ToR deliverables must be in French. Would you please confirm the submission could also be submitted in French?<br />A: The SF-330 submission must be in English.</p>
<p>41.	Regarding the applicable standards for the conceptual and preliminary design, we understood from the terms of reference, that the A&amp;E was expected to provide a list of relevant standards (for instance North American and European, cf page 16 and 30). However we found the sentence "Final Designs are per US Standards" confusing. Could you please clarify whether or not the A&amp;E is expected to propose the most relevant standards, North American, European or local standards?<br />A: The final design standards are defined by level of completeness of the design per U.S. design standards.</p>
<p>42.	The Evaluation Factor 3 requires the following, "An average of at least $100 million USD in total annual revenue over the last five (5) years, totaling at least $500 million USD over the five (5) year period (reference date of issue of the solicitation)." This restricts the competition to very large firms. Please confirm that the $500 million USD is the revenue of A-E/Construction services by the Prime Contractor only and whether or not MCC would consider easing this requirement.<br />A: This value is for the prime contractor only and MCC is not consider easing this requirement, which will help us ensure sufficient experience in similar size and scope as MCC's requirement.</p>
<p>[End of Amendment 2]</p>
<p>Amendment 3</p>
<p>The purpose of Amendment 3 is (1) to extend the Submission Due Date to 5:00pm ET on 4 February 2019 (Friday), (2) to answer several questions posed by interested bidders, and (3) to issue updated Attachment a.1 Terms of Reference (ToR) 20181227 (Microsoft Word) [Official]. This Amendment 3 revises the answers to Amendment 2 Questions 1 and 2. Please note the information in this Amendment 3, including the Attachments, supplants any conflicting information you may found in previous versions of this Synopsis. Any changes to the previous version of the synopsis are highlighted in the body in yellow. Any changes to revised version of the ToR are noted in the Track Changes.</p>
<p>We have made some changes to the ToR, including the removal of one task (formerly 3.1.4.2) and its associated deliverable (Deliverable 14). We also added language regarding the bachelor's degrees for engineering positions at the senior level, namely that the degrees shall come from accredited engineering institutions. We provided the names of the accreditation institutions with links for verification in the US, Canada, France and international agreements (Washington Accords and CTI).</p>
<p>Firms must acknowledge Amendments 1, 2, and 3 in their Cover Letter. Firms may simply state, "Firm ABC acknowledges Amendments 1, 2, and 3."</p>
<p>Questions and Answers (Q&amp;As):</p>
<p>1.	Requirements for the Pavement Engineer (s) (P. 58 of the ToR): "S/he shall have a Masters' degree in Civil Engineering with specialty in concrete pavements and high modulus asphalts." To our knowledge, this specialty is acquired rather after years of practice. Would you consider lowering the education requirement?<br />A: Section 5 paragraph 7 allows for the substitution of years of experience for a Master's degree.</p>
<p>2.	TOR 5.2.1 page 57: Can PM/TL's two projects over $175 million count toward the requirement that s/he must have led at least three projects over the past 10 years? In other words, is three total projects acceptable, or is MCC looking for five total projects for the PM/TL?<br />A: The two (2) urban infrastructure projects valued at over $175 million can be counted as part of the three (3) projects over the last ten (10) years.</p>
<p>3.	Can MCC provide a copy of WSP's VGE integrated model?<br />A: MCC would require a legal approval to release this model, which may significantly delay this procurement. We also don't believe this is critical for bidders to prepare their submission. Therefore, this will not be shared with the interested bidders. However, it will be made available to the awardee after the award.</p>
<p>4.	Does a cost loaded implementation plan with WBS need to be provided for the purposes of this qualifications-based submittal?<br />A: No. this will need to be provided with the financials as part of the second phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>5.	Who will have primary responsibility for developing the Stakeholder Engagement Plan - the ESOC or the A&amp;E? (There seems to be conflicting references to SEP preparation on pages 9 and 16 of the TOR.)<br />A: The A&amp;E has total responsibility for planning and conducting all Stakeholder Engagement for all activities that are conducted under their contract scope. The ESOC has responsibility for the Project-wide Stakeholder Engagement Plan as required under the IFC PS and MCC, of which the Stakeholder Engagement program of the A&amp;E is a part. The ESOC will need to capture and document what the A&amp;E does in the larger Project-wide Stakeholder Engagement Plan and the A&amp;E will need to share information and collaborate with the ESOC on its approach and results. Note on page 17 of the ToR, it states, "The A&amp;E shall provide a preliminary stakeholder engagement plan including stakeholder mapping for completing the requirement." Therefore, this is consistent and correct.</p>
<p>6.	Who will have primary responsibility for developing the Training course - the ESOC or the A&amp;E? (There seems to be conflicting references on pages 9 and 13 of the TOR.)<br />A: The two training courses and objectives are different. Additional clarification is provided in revised ToR with this Amendment. Each consultant is responsible for their own course content development.</p>
<p>7.	Who shall bear the costs of stakeholder engagement expenses such as venues, media adverts and information materials?<br />A: The A&amp;E shall bear the costs of stakeholder engagement expenses such as venues, media adverts and information materials for all Stakeholder Engagement activities that are conducted under their contract scope. Page 10 of the ToR has been modified to reflect this.</p>
<p>8.	One of the requirements for the key personnel is to have a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and/or construction engineering. In some non-US countries, the degree is not called bachelor and not always civil, construction. Could the wording be modified to Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering or similar?<br />A: Yes, this has been adjusted. Note that MCC reserves the exclusive right to evaluate what constitutes similar; as such the firm shall provide supporting evidence to help inform the MCC appropriately.</p>
<p>9.	Can the A/E proposed different dates for the deliverables as long as the Base and Option Period do not go beyond the timeframe proposed by MCC? Also, can the A/E include additional deliverables not listed in the ToR?<br />A: Yes, the A&amp;E is encouraged to propose different dates for deliverables. The A/E may propose additional deliverables, however the MCC reserves the right to accept or decline the proposal.</p>
<p>10.	General Review and Approval Question. Please specify that the NTE Due dates provided in the schedules of the RFP are for DRAFT deliverables, which will begin the review "clock" ticking, and NOT for Final deliverables having undergone the 4-week pre-submission review process.<br />A: The dates provided are for approval of the deliverables. See Question No. 9 above. The A&amp;E may modify the deliverables schedule as long as they fit in the period of performance provided.</p>
<p>11.	It is stated that the A/E must possess an average of at least $100 million USD in total annual revenue over the last five years. Please clarify if the $100 million refers to revenue from design and/or from construction. Some design firms do not provide construction services.<br />A: This refers to annual revenue generated by the prime contractor's architecture and/or engineering design work.</p>
<p>12.	TOR Page 44. 4.2 Deliverables. The RFP specifies that the official language of all deliverables is in French; however, also references translation requirements. Later, MCC requests that Monthly Reports be provided in both French &amp; English. Please clarify language requirements for all primary deliverables as French only. (Only Deliverables 1 and 2 specifically note the French language requirement.)<br />A: Section 4.4.2.1 Base Period Deliverables notes that all deliverables are in French unless otherwise noted. This clarification has been extended to Section 4.4.2.2 Option Period 1 Deliverables.</p>
<p>13.	TOR Page 44, 4.3 Review of Work. Please consider changing the deliverable review and time schedule to a set time frame, such as "Total deliverable review and finalization will be no more than 28 calendar days, which begins at the time the draft final is delivered to the MCC, MCA and appropriate organizations for review. Review organization have 14 calendar days to provide comments for inclusion or discussion, at which time the A&amp;E has 14 days to include, discuss and revise the draft to Final. If reviewing organizations do not meet the 14-day deadline, the A&amp;E is not obliged to include them. The A&amp;E is responsible to keep record of and time stamp all received comments. This system does not preclude the A&amp;E from eliciting informal feedback and comments during the drafting process." <br />A: This change has been provided in the ToR.</p>
<p>14.	TOR Page 45. 4.3.1. and 4.3.2 CTCTR Monthly Progress &amp; Design Review Meetings. MCC requires that the CTCTR meetings include videoconferencing. Please confirm that publicly available systems, such as Skype or Zoom can be used for this purpose. <br />A: Publicly available systems are permissible as long as they provide a high quality videoconferencing environment with proper audio and video quality for all participants.</p>
<p>15.	TOR Page 46. Monthly reports. In this section of the RFP, MCC request that the monthly report must include a detailed time sheet for all personnel documenting in and out of country time. However, MCC has defined the contract terms as Firm Fixed Price, or FFP. Under FFP contracts, detailed time and costs are not required to be reviewed, presented or approved. Please clarify this requirement under the standard terms of a FFP contract structure. <br />A: This monthly report is to allow quality management by MCC. This is not to confirm the cost or invoice; this is to ensure that the contractor is providing a quality work as they proposed and negotiated.</p>
<p>16.	TOR Page 44-47. Inception Report. The RFP states the draft Inception Report is due two weeks prior to the kick off meeting but the Abidjan Kick Off, and the final report is due within two weeks of the kick off meeting. Yet, the RFP states the Inception Report is Due at Week 10. The dates do not seem to coincide appropriately.<br />A: As noted in the Deliverables Timeline 4.4.2.1.10 Base Period Deliverable Timeline and 4.4.2.2.6 Option Period 1 Deliverable Timeline, the deliverable timelines are indicative and will be proposed and finalized by the A&amp;E.</p>
<p>17.	TOR Page 18. Task 3.1.2.1.1 Data Collection. Traffic counting data is not detailed in this task. Data is supposed to be collected for traffic counts, OD, safety assessment, injuries and fatalities, truck parking needs and land availability. Only OD survey is detailed. Other types of data seem to be rather requested in further tasks.<br />A: As noted in Section 3.1.2 Multimodal traffic demand and simulation model for the Project Zone of Influence, the objectives of the task are to perform data collection to develop a Traffic Demand and Simulation Model and develop a multimodal traffic demand and simulation model for trip generation, trip assignment, modal distribution and trip assignment. The A&amp;E shall develop a methodology to accomplish this task accordingly.</p>
<p>18.	TOR Page 27. 3.1.5.1 Conceptual Design. Traffic Assessment asks to perform a specific detailed traffic counts (during AM and PM peak periods, while it is not specified in Data Collection. Does this traffic count different from the one asked in Task 3.1.2.1.1 Data collection?<br />A: The A&amp;E must propose, justify, and implement a data collection plan as part of the mandate. MCC believes traffic counts are necessary.</p>
<p>19.	Data Collection. Can you confirm the Data collection for deliverable 4 includes only the road sections from figure 2 (excluding Boul de la Paix and Yopougon)?<br />A: The Project Zone of Influence is detailed under section 1.2.2 Project Zone of Influence. Figure 2 is provided as a partial reference material for the Project Zone of Influence.</p>
<p>20.	Traffic Counting. Does the MCC expect the A/E to complete the traffic counting only with Deliverable 8-Conceptual Design at week 32?<br />A: Data collection results and simulations (to account for various network development scenarios or deviation plans) are required for the conceptual designs. The data collection may be performed earlier if needed.</p>
<p>21.	Due Date. When is the Preliminary ESIA and Resettlement Report due and what is the required content?<br />A: The A&amp;E shall include relevant ESIA and Resettlement information in the Preliminary Design Documents as outlined under Section 3.2.1.4. Deliverables found under section 4.4.2.2.1 Deliverable 9 note preliminary ESIA and resettlement risks and results shall be included.</p>
<p>22.	Deliverable. Can you clarify the requirements in terms of Preliminary ESIA and resettlement in Deliverable 8 and Deliverable 9? From the deliverable descriptions (section 3.1.5.7 and section 4.4.2.2.1.1), both deliverables 8 and 9 should include the preliminary ESIA and resettlement assessment. Please provide details of what is expected.<br />A: Section 3.1.5.7 Conceptual Design is modified to summary ESIA and resettlement assessments, while 3.2.1 Preliminary designs and its deliverables under Section 4.4.2.2.1 Deliverable 9 note preliminary ESIA and resettlement risks and results shall be included. The Conceptual Design ESIA elements are meant to highlight the major aspects that may influence the overall design selection; the preliminary design is a more completed version of the selected conceptual design with more refined resettlement, environmental and social risks and measures identified.</p>
<p>23.	Preliminary Estimates and types of PAP. What was the methodology used to estimate the preliminary number and type of PAP? What were the criteria used to distinguish permanently and temporarily displaced PAP?<br />A: It should be emphasized that the estimates of the number of PAPS are indicative only and NOT definitive. The presence of PAPs and the estimate of number of PAPS was assessed through counts made using satellite imagery coupled with windshield survey and intermittent on the ground counts. The difference between permanently displaced and temporarily displaced PAPS is that permanently displaced PAPs will not be able to resume their activities in their original location post-project completion.</p>
<p>24.	Overlap ESOC-A&amp;E. Could you clarify the responsibility of the A&amp;E vs the ESOC:</p>
<p>a)	The ESOC should develop training courses for the MCA and CTCTR, 6 courses X 16 h, all of them have the same topic as the 36h-classes provided by the A&amp;E. Can you clarify the differences between both training programs?<br />A: The ESOC courses are generalized courses meant to provide a general awareness and understanding of each of the selected topics in anticipation of the A&amp;E modules, which are meant to be more specialized and focused on providing the CTCTR with sufficient understanding to participate in the engineering design phase and to deliver the road projects during the Compact period as noted in paragraph 1 of 3.1.4.1 Training for the CTCTR.</p>
<p>b)	Who, between the A&amp;E and ESOC, is responsible to coordinate the engagement and effort of INP-HB and ENSEA?<br />A: The ESOC is responsible for engaging with the INP-HB and ENSEA for their six (6) modules, while the A&amp;E is responsible for coordination with INP-HB and ENSEA, with support from MCA-CI, for its ten (10) modules.</p>
<p>c)	What is the effort expected from INP-HB and ENSEA for those training programs? Should the A&amp;E plan a budget for local professors in addition to international trainers?<br />A: The INP-HB and ENSEA have separate budgets from the A&amp;E. Note that the A&amp;E is expected to provide the training itself and not through professors from either institution. Note that professors from both institutions may be present during the modules.</p>

<p>Award evaluations will be conducted in accordance with FAR 36.602 Selection of firms for architect-engineer contracts.</p>
<p>7.a.	Basis for Qualification</p>
<p>The Government intends to award one hybrid firm-fixed price (FFP) and time-and-materials (T&amp;M) contract with base period and two option periods to the firm that is determined to be a highly qualified and is fair and reasonable to the Government. For each evaluation factor, with an exception to the Evaluation Factor 5 Past Performance, the Government will perform a comparative analysis of the advantages and disadvantages, including their significance, and assign one of following adjectival ratings:</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation Ratings<br />Outstanding (O)	The qualification exceeds the Government's expectations. The Government expects that the firm should result in outstanding effective, efficient, and economical performance under the contract. The submission contains several significant advantages and no more than a few minor disadvantages. The performance risk is deemed to be very low.<br />Satisfactory (S)	The qualification meets the Government's expectations. The Government expects satisfactory performance under the contract. The submission contains many advantages and only a few minor disadvantages. The performance risk is deemed to be low.<br />Marginal (M)	The qualification marginally satisfies the Government's expectations. The firm demonstrates a shallow understanding of the work to be accomplished. The submission contains several disadvantages and only a few advantages. The performance risk is deemed to be moderate to high.<br />Unsatisfactory (U)	The qualification fails to meet the Government's expectations. The submission is incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, and/or so incorrect as to be unsatisfactory. The submission contains significant disadvantages that are unacceptable. The performance risk is deemed to be very high.</p>
<p>MCC will use the following adjectival risk ratings to evaluate the firms' relevant Past Performance References:</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation Ratings<br />Low Risk	The relevant Past Performance References have only positive reviews ("Satisfactory" or better using the CPARS standards) of the firm.<br />Moderate Risk	The relevant Past Performance References have generally positive reviews ("Satisfactory" or better) with possibly some negative reviews ("Marginal" or worse) of the firm.<br />High Risk	The relevant Past Performance References have mostly negative reviews ("Marginal" or worse) of the firm.<br />Neutral	Offerors without relevant Past Performance References will be assigned "Neutral" rating, which is neither favorable nor unfavorable to the Offeror.</p>
<p>7.b.	Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>All submissions will be evaluated based on the evaluation factors listed below in descending order starting with the most important factor:</p>
<p>Evaluation Factor 1: Proposed team professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.</p>
