<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for numerical modeling and system virtualization toresearch the feasibility of moving the development environment from the current linuxbased environment to an Intel based virtual machine. Work to be performed as follows:1. Create a standalone development system which mimics the current environment utilizedby the Software integration and Visualization Office (Code 610.3) for the front end tothe super computer.2. Establish performance baselines for the standalone system.3. Develop a prototype virtual machine that executes on Intel  based Host OS. As Code610.3 uses a variety of Host OS, VMWare virtualization products will provide the mostefficient path. This includes VMServer, VMServer Console and VMPlayer for Windows andLinux along with VMWare Fusion for Mac OSX.4. Test interoperability of VMWare solutions across the variety of Host OSimplementations. Host OS which will be tested include Windows XP, Red Hat Fedora Core 7and Mac OSX (flavor to be defined by Code 610.3).5. Establish baselines for performance in Virtual environments.6.
