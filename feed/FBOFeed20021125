<DESC>The SAS System for Information Delivery cannot be obtained from any other sources/vendors , because it contains proprietary software.  The SAS owns all of the copyrights to the software and controls the source code to it products.  The SSAS system for Information Delivery software uniquely provides extensive statistical capabilities that enable analysts to evalute information for both specialized and enterprise-wide analytical needs. SAS provides to analysts, application programmers, and users a variety of statistical tools including analysis of variance, regressional, categorical data analysis, and multivariate analysis.  SAS software has the strength of portability and cross-platform utilization.  Data can be easily imported from a multitutde of sources and manipulated into generic Perfromance databases to ensure data consisitency and integrity.  Centralized diverse data sources to common database enables users to perform their own analysis on a quick turnaround basis for repetitive and/or ad hoc reporting.  SAS integrated graphing capabilities enable computer performance analysts and users to visually portray their output into widely customizable graphics.  SAS Web technology now allows data to be taken from its source to publication within a single product suite. The SAS Institute, supplier of SAS for Info. Delivery is the only source of this multi-facted software.  It has been determined that no other firm has the software that can meet these requirements.   As a result, Customs plans to negotiate a FFP contract with SAS on a non-competitive basis for one year and 2 option years.

<DESC>NA The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command (AMCOM), proposes to award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract, entitled “Aviation Auxiliary Power Distribution System (APDS) for the Hybrid Electric (HE) Vehicle Integra tion and Demonstration” to: SOLECTRIA Corporation, 9 Forbes Road Woburn MA 01801. The resultant contract will consist of a twelve (12) month CPFF contract with no options.    The Contractor shall design, develop, test and deliver a lightweight compact Auxiliary Power Distribution System (APDS) for integration into the Shop Equipment Contract Maintenance (SECM) vehicle.  The SECM shall be mounted onto a Hybrid Electric (HE) High  Mobility Maintenance Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV). The input power to the APDS shall be 288 VDC, 75kW nominal. The APDS shall supply 48 kw, 3 phase, 4 wire 115/200vac, 400hz, 110/120vac, 60hz, 28vdc, and 270vdc.  Power supplied by the APDS shall be in accordan ce with MIL-STD-704E.  In addition to the APDS the Contractor shall deliver (1) test plan, (2) final test report, (3) technical data package (TDP) consisting of (a) a system performance specification, (b) operators manual/maintenance instructions, and (c) engineering drawings and associated lists to Level III or equivalent, and the Contractor shall support a Government Evaluation/Test.    At this time, Solectria is the only known source with the unique qualifications based on prior experience with the successful development of an APDS for the HE HMMWV.  Solectria is currently working a follow-on second generation to that APDS.  The Governme nt did not acquire a detail design specification or a competitive technical data package inclusive of detailed manufacturing data for another competitive source to manufacture the Solectria-developed APDS.    This requirement will use the advanced developm ent stage of that APDS as the basis upon which to build the Aviation’s more extensive integration and demonstration effort.  The objective of the demonstration effort is to define performance specification for future acquisition.   Solectria is the only kn own available source with a existing APDS for the HE HMMWV to develop the Aviation APDS requirement; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement and submit proposals.  All responsible sources may sub mit an offer to the above mailing address, which will be considered.  Alpha contracting methods with Solectria will be used.  A solicitation document is not available.  Submit inquires regarding this procurement to Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, ATTN: AMSAM-RD-AA-C (Ms. Sandra Schuck), Building 401 Lee Blvd., Fort Eustis, Virginia 23604-5577.  Point of contact is Ms. Sandra Schuck at (757) 878-4819 or by email sschuck@aatd.eustis.army.mil See Numbered Note 22 and 26.

<DESC>This is a follow-on announcement to three synopses that MARAD issued in June, August, and September, 2002,   regarding an A-76 cost comparison study of MARAD's NDRF sites at Suisun Bay near Benicia, Calif., James River near Ft. Eustis, Va; and the Neches River, near Beaumont, Texas.   

The A-76 study will review the operations at the NDRF sites to determine the least costly and most efficient method of operation.  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, "Performance of Commercial Activities", sets forth the general policy of the Government to achieve economy and enhance productivity.  The circular requires Federal agencies to review their commercial activities to determine whether it would be more economical to continue operating them in-house (i.e., with Government employees) or under contract with commercial sources.  The review will be conducted in accordance with Circular A-76 and the revised supplemental handbook.  

This synopsis serves to publish the web site with link to the MARAD Reserve Fleet Tech Library.  At present, the link is only to the updated Fleet Manual.  In the near future, the link will direct the user to the technical library, which will include, among other documents,  the updated Performance Work Statement, technical exhibits, workload data, layouts of the sites, and Government-furnished property lists.  The site for the manual is:

The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this BAA. Those offerors submitting white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA will be invited to submit a proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a subsequent contract or assistance instruments (grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction). Proposals submitted may be evaluated as they are received. A contract or assistance instrument could be awarded as a result of this BAA, as appropriate. We expect most awards with universities and non-profit organizations to be grants. Note that there is no inherent funding associated with this BAA, and any contract/assistance instrument will depend on availability of funds from other sources. For the purpose of this BAA the size standard is 500 employees (NAICS 541710) and may be amended at any time. 

B. RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS: Please refer to attachment #1 entitled, Research Requirements.

PART II PROPOSAL EVALUATION 

A. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA will be evaluated as received using the factors given below. The factors are listed in descending order of importance. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the proposals. 
1. The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, the potential contributions of the effort to the AFRL/MN mission and the extent to which the research effort will contribute to balancing this directorate's overall research program. 
2. The offeror's capabilities, related experience (to include past and present performance), facilities, techniques, or unique combinations of these that are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives. 
3. The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives. 
4. The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees if any, the proposed cost share by the offeror if any, and the availability of funds. 

B. Upon receipt of a proposal, the AFRL/MN technical staff will perform an initial review of its scientific merit and potential contribution to the Air Force mission and also determine if funds are expected to be available for the effort. Proposals not considered having sufficient scientific merit or relevance to Air Force needs, or those in areas for which funds are not expected to be available, may be declined without further review. 

C. It is the policy of AFRL/MN to treat all proposals as privileged information prior to award, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. Proposals not declined as a result of initial review will be subject to an extensive evaluation by highly qualified scientists from within the Government. The offeror must indicate on the appropriate form any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the proposal. 

D. Each proposal will be evaluated based on the merit and relevance of the specific research proposed as it relates to the overall AFRL/MN program, rather than against other proposals for research in the same general area. 

PART III PROPOSAL PREPARATION 

A. Each proposal submitted should consist of two volumes. Volume 1 should provide the technical proposal and Volume 2 should address the price/cost portions of the proposal. Volume I and II should be limited to a total of 25 pages, including resumes, charts, figures, tables, etc. Pages in excess of the specified 25 pages will be removed and returned to the offeror before evaluation starts.  A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11-inch piece of paper with information on it. Minimum print size is 10-point type, or 12 pitch. Every proposal shall have at least one copy submitted on disk or via e-mail with a hard copy of the signature page sent via regular mail. Proposals submitted on disk or sent via e-mail are to be submitted on Microsoft Office 97 or Microsoft Word 2000 format. Note: The preferred format for all proposals is via electronic means, whether on disc or e-mail. The Government intends to work proposals and awards through electronic means. To do business with the Air Force Research Laboratory/Munitions Directorate (AFRL/MN), you must have software packages that are compatible with Microsoft Office 97. 

B. The technical portion of the proposal, Volume 1, should contain the following: 1. A title and abstract that includes a concise Statement of Work and basic approaches to be utilized. The Statement of Work should indicate the effort intended for each period of research. 2. A reasonably complete discussion stating the background and objectives of the proposed work, the approaches to be considered, and the resources to be employed. Include also the nature and extent of the anticipated results, and if known, the manner in which the work will contribute to the accomplishment of the agency's mission. 3. The names, brief biographical information, and a list of recent publications of the offeror's key personnel who will be involved in the research. Documentation of previous work or experience of the proposer in the field is especially important. 4. The type of support, if any, the offeror requests of the Munitions Directorate, e.g. facilities, equipment, and materials. 5. The names of federal, state, local agencies or other parties receiving the proposals and/or funding the proposed effort of a similar nature. If none, so state. 6. The identity of facilities, specialized equipment, or other real property to be used for the work, if appropriate for an understanding of the technical work to be conducted. 7. Identify all on-going Government contracts and related past contracts or assistance instruments. Provide a technical point of contact and telephone number for each contract cited. 

C. The cost portion of the proposal, Volume 2, should contain the following: 1. Proposal Pricing Cover Sheet for total proposal. 2. Summary by cost element and profit for each contract line and sub-line item and for the total proposal. 3. Labor summary for total proposal by categories, rates, and hours. Include an explanation of how labor rates are computed, including base rates and escalation. Show that are level of effort, if applicable. For proposals from universities, the times and amounts to be charged should be identified by academic year and summer effort. 4. Identification of indirect rates by fiscal year and explanation of how established and base to which they apply. 5. Bill of materials detailing items by type, quantity, and unit price, total amount, and source of estimate. Provide vendor quotes. 6. Summary of all travels by destination, purpose, number of people and days, air fare, per diem, car rental, etc. 7. Consultants by name, rate, and number of days or hours. Furnish copy of consulting agreement, and identify prior agreements under which the consultant received the proposed rate. 8. Other direct costs by type, amount, cost per unit and purpose. Specifically identify any costs for printing and publication and computers. 9. Subcontractor's proposal with prime offeror's price/cost analysis of subcontractor's proposal. If subcontractor was not competed, include justification. 10. Forecast of monthly dollar commitments for the proposed contract period. 11. Type of contract or assistance instrument proposed. (We expect most awards to universities and non-profit organizations to be grants.) 12. State whether you are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, nonprofit, educational, or historically black college or university. 13. Other terms and conditions, if any. 

D. Grants, cooperative agreements, and other transactions are encouraged. Information regarding these can be found in the AFMC Homepage - site: http://www.afmc.wpafb.af.mil/organizations/HQ-AFMC/PK/pkt/jump.htm. The cost proposal should follow items one (1) through thirteen (13), above, as applicable for assistance instruments. 

E. Award of a grant to universities or nonprofit institutions, in lieu of a contract, will be considered and will be subject to the mutual agreement of the parties.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The Government intends to issue a modification to Contract No. DATM01-02-D-0001, Advance CounterMeasures Systems (ACMS) to add three one-year options.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Advance CounterMeasures to issue the modification a gainst the current contract under FAR Part 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  The current contract was awarded as a sole source to Advance CounterMeasures Systems (ACMS), a small bus iness located at 3034 Gold Canal Drive, Rancho Cordova, California  95670-61169838.   The current contract is an Indefinite Delivery Quantity (IDIQ)/Cost Plus Fixed Fee and Fixed Price contract for one year.  The performance period for the first option yea r will be 1 April 2003 through 31 March 2004 and the two corresponding years (1 April 2004 through 31 March 2005 and 1 April 2005 through 31 March 2006).  The contract is for instrumentation development support to include but not all inclusive: research, d evelopment, design, and production services required to support the operational test, investigation experimentation, modeling, simulation, and stimulation mission of the Operational Test Command at Fort Hood, Texas.  The contractor is responsible for all l abor, management, supplies, materials, equipment, and tools required to perform this contract.  ACMS has designed and developed three unique, one-of-a-kind instrumentation systems for use during operational testing.  ACMS designed and developed these syste ms (Improved Field Data Collector, Dismounted Field Data Collector, Threat Synthetic Communications Jammer) hardware and software, the ancillary software and hardware, plus interface hardware and software for other test and evaluation instrumentation syste ms.  These systems are in an evolutionary development and design cycle with each iteration requiring development, production, testing, and evaluation.  Each evolution incorporates lessons learned and revises performance requirements.  ACMS develops, upgrad es and produces interface hardware and software as these systems, and those they interface with, changes.  ACMS also performs Preplanned Product Improvements (PPI) to the systems delivered to the Government to upgrade performance as the evolutionary cycle progresses.  The Government projects purchasing approximately 600 systems over the next five years.  The Government does not own a data package suitable for competition or manufacture and, in accordance with DOD policy, does not intend to expend funds for a technical data package until each systems' design is stabilized.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710 with a size standard of  500 employees.  Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to res pond to the requirement or submit proposals.    This notice of  intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  The  point of contact for this requirement is Edna Smith, Contract Specialist, email SmithEdna@otc.army.mil or Craig Stark, Contracting Officer, email StarkCraig@otc.army.mil.  See Note(s) 22 and 26.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine a requirement for a three-year contract to collaborate with CDC's TB Trials Consortium in a phase 2 trial of moxifloxacin versus ethambutol in the 4-drug intensive phase of treatment of tuberculosis.  Through its field collaboration with Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, Case Western can assure access to large numbers of patients with active TB disease who can be enrolled within 7 days of the start of TB therapy, treated with FDA-approved companion medications, and monitored by an experienced clinical staff able to comply with FDA requirements for Good Clinical Practices.  The site must also have ready access to a fully qualified mycobacteriology laboratory, and must be experienced in data management for large scale clinical trials, and must have an available ethics committee meeting all Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) requirements.   The site must be capable of enrolling 150 patients over the course of two years, and following patients during the full six months of TB treatment.   Moreover, because costly supplies of study drugs and matching placebo will expire in early 2005, the site must be able promptly to begin enrollment immediately following the expected award date of April 1, 2003.  Case Western is the only known contractor with the unique capacity in the area of TB clinical trials AND who possesses the current capacity to satisfy the stringent time requirements for this procurement.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by notifying Cynthia R. Collins by email at coc9@cdc.gov or by facsimile at 770-488-2688.  Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide the technical manual, NAVAIR 03-5AA-170, and drawings referenced in the original combined synopsis/ solicitation, Drwg #955120, Dwg #955138, Dwg #955112 and Dwg #955125.  In addition, the following clarifications are incorporated: &#61607; There is no drawing available showing outline dimensions for the Governor.  However, in Specification 802027257400, paragraphs 3.5.2.1 and 3.5.2.2 give envelope dimensions.  The overall length of the Governor Assembly is 24.5 inches, including the Nose Cap.  Paragraph 3.4.2 gives the minimum test item length as 30 inches.  This length allows the Nose Cap to be removed from the Governor Assembly without removing the Governor from the test setup, allowing plenty of space for correction weights to be added to the forward balancing plane. &#61607; The bearing type and designation that is used in t he final assembly are press fit (actually heated for expansion) on to the Rotor Shaft of the Electrical Generator that is powered by the Governor Assembly.  The Governor Shaft fits inside and through the Generator Rotor Shaft, so the bearings do not actually touch the Governor Shaft.  A data sheet of this bearing is available if required.  &#61607; The previous test system used a laser with a photocell to measure blade angle.  The system determined the percentage of an individual cycle (speed independent) in which the laser was blocked, then translated that into an arc length per blade, and then converted that into blade angle.  &#61607; The closing date of the solicitation is extended to 02 December 2002.

RESPONSE: YES;  If so, what percent? RESPONSE: Do include the rate you propose as a percentage in your proposal.

8.	Does the licensing contractor collect the royalties? 
RESPONSE: No, they are sent directly to the USDA Forest Service and the contractor prepares accounts and bills quarterly. See Statement of Work for details.

ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES MAY SUBMIT A PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION. Simplified procedures will be used.  Offers to include Tax Payer Identification Number, DUNS number and business size. BACKGROUND: The USDA Forest Service Cooperative Fire Prevention Program is a comprehensive information and education awareness program that uses Smokey Bear as the vehicle for forest fire prevention messages. The program uses a variety of techniques and approaches to stimulate active support and cooperation with other public agencies, educators, business industry and organizations in working to prevent human caused wildfires.  Smokey Bear and prevention messages were introduced in 1944. By the 1950s, the icon and message were successful enough to warrant being protected by Federal law. The Smokey Bear Act. PL 82-359 and amended PL 93-318 were passed to provide protection for his image and use and allow for the collection of royalties. The law authorized the commercial use of Smokey Bear with permission of the USDA Forest Service, in consultation with the Ad Council and the National Association of State Foresters. It permitted the secretary of Agriculture to license the use of Smokey Bear and collect royalties and secure them in a fund to be used only for the prevention of forest fires. That authority has been delegated to the Forest Service.  
The current licensing program was established in 1952. A licensing contractor has managed the vendor licensing for the last ten years. Currently (2002) the program has 49 licensed vendors.  This program has roughly maintained this number since 1997. The annual royalties are approximately $100,000. SCOPE OF REQUIREMENTS: The purpose of commercial licensing of Smokey Bear and his message is to increase awareness of human caused fires through message exposure and to generate royalties for fire prevention program initiatives. However, commercial licensing ventures must retain the original purpose of the symbol and his current message ?Only You Can Prevent Wildfires.? The Image and appearance of all licensee products must meet established guidelines and standards for quality control. This includes review and approval of all artwork, costume, association, context and presentation of the trademark symbol by the USDA Forest Service in consultation with the National Association of State Foresters and the Ad Council. Final approval of all proposals, products and licensing is the responsibility of the USDA Forest Service, Fire and Aviation Management, Fire Prevention Officer.
Specific information on established guidelines is referenced in FSH 5109.18 Wildland Fire Prevention Handbook. Chapter 20 Smokey Bear Program and The Smokey Bear Style Guide located on smokeybear.com. Background on the Smokey Bear fire prevention campaigns can also be found on the web site smokeybear.com 
The objectives of the commercial licensing for Smokey Bear are to:

NIST DOCKET NUMBER:  01-021US

Title:  Method Of Minimizing The Short-Term Frequency Instability Of Laser-Pumped Atomic Clocks

Description:  The invention proposes a method of optimizing the performance of laser-pumped atomic frequency references with respect to the laser detuning and other operating parameters.  The invention establishes that the frequency reference short-term instability will be minimized when a) the laser frequency is tuned nominally a few tens of MHz away from the center of the atomic absorption line; and b) the external oscillator lock modulation frequency is set either far below or far above the inverse of the optical pumping time of the atoms.  The exact parameters for the optimization depend on the particular experimental situation and can be roughly calculated using a theory developed to simulate the clock performance.  


NIST DOCKET NUMBER:  02-004US

Title:  Bio-Affinity Gel Plugs in Microfluidic Channels

Description:  Acrylamide-modified DNA probes are immobilized in polycarbonate microfluidic channels via photopolymerization in a polyacrylamide matrix.  The resulting polymeric, hydrogel plugs are porous under electrophoretic conditions and hybridize with fluorescently-tagged complementary DNA.  The double stranded DNA can be chemically denatured and the chip may be reused with a new analytical sample.  Conditions for photopolymerization, hybridization, and denaturation are discussed.  Photopolymertization of plugs containing different DNA probe sequences in one microfluidic channel, thereby enabling the selective detection of multiple DNA targets in one electrophoretic pathway are also demonstrated.


NIST DOCKET NUMBER:  02-007PA

Title:  Non-Volatile Magnetic Solid State Memory

Description:  This invention provides an implementation of a magnetic random access memory device which uses the principle of pulsed-current induced magnetic domain reconfiguration for data storage and a nanocontact magnetoresistive effect to 'read' the encoded data.
