<DESC><p>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, MD, intends to award a modification under task order N00178-05-D-4466 M803 with Naval Systems, Inc., (NSI) of Lexington Park, MD. This modification will be for Logistics Support services for PMA-231 (E-2/C-2 Program). The services will include Logistics Program Management Support, Logistics Supportability Analyses, and Power and Propulsion System and Support Equipment. A sole source modification is consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements would result given any other action due to current circumstances. This notice is being posted because the option, under FAR 52.217-8, was not previously evaluated as part of the initial contract award. This option exercise will be at the current rates specified in the current contract, as allowed by FAR 52.217-8, and will extend the period of performance end date from 13 December 2011 to 12 May 2012. This option exercise will further allow for solicitation, evaluation, and award of the competitive follow-on procurement. The incumbent contractor is the only responsible offeror for exercise of this option, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements if this option were not exercised before the current contract expiration date of 12 December 2011. <br /><br />This notice is not a request for proposals. No phone inquiries will be entertained. All responses shall be made in writing by email, U.S. mail, or facsimile to the attention of Danita Ellison danita.ellison@navy.mil using the contact information provided in this synopsis.</p>

<DESC>Dear Prospective Offeror:
<p>The Smithsonian Institution (Smithsonian) hereby invites you to submit a proposal for solicitation #RN11SOL0032 ("RFP") for distribution, fulfillment, and call center services.

The Smithsonian is interested in achieving efficiencies and benefits in the retail stores distribution and catalog/web/fulfillment operations by consolidating its current operations. Interested Offerors will be required to submit a proposal in response to the RFP, which will be due by 2:00 P.M., DC local time on Friday, December 16, 2011. <br /><br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR A FEDERAL CONTRACT AND IS THEREFORE NOT GOVERNED BY FEDERAL PROCUREMENT PROCEDURES.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>General Services Administration, Public Buildings Service (PBS), Design &amp; Construction Division (6PC), East Acquisition Branch (6PCA), 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, MO, 64131-3088<br /><br />Request for Proposals Notice for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Task Order Construction Contract (MATOC) with Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Capabilities, for the states of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska (GSA, PBS Region 6).<br /><br />This procurement is Full and Open, and is not a set aside for small business. Task orders issued as a result of this contract may be set aside for small business. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is: 236220 and the size standard is $33.5 million.<br /><br />GSA anticipates issuing the Request for Proposals late September 2011 with receipt of proposals late October 2011.<br /><br />GSA anticipates awarding multiple contracts (one contract per successful offeror) as a result of the solicitation. Contracts will be for one (1) base year with options for four (4) additional years. Total contract length with base and all options exercised is five (5) years. Contractors will be expected to compete for design-bid-build general contractor duties, as well as CMc duties. The type of task order, design-bid-build or CMc, will be determined prior to the issuance of each individual order placed under the base contract. Offerors receiving an award as a result of this solicitation will be eligible, but not required, to place offers on all task orders issued under this contract. <br /><br />The maximum value (total of the base and all option periods) of each contract awarded as a result of this solicitation is $50,000,000. Each contract awarded will contain a guaranteed minimum amount to be identified in the solicitation. Individual task orders will not exceed $20,000,000 without the contractor's consent. However, a typical task order issued as a result of this contract will be between $150,000 and $3,000,000. <br /><br />This is a competitive negotiated acquisition. Proposals (Technical and Price) will be evaluated by the Government using source selection procedures. The Government intends to use the best value concept in making the selections. The best value concept is a method of evaluating technical qualifications and price as specified in the solicitation which in the Government's estimation provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement. Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal's acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted. The Government may make an award without discussions. Therefore, offerors will be requested to submit initial proposals to the Government on the most favorable terms from a technical and price standpoint. <br /><br />Two proposal packages will be considered: a technical evaluation package and price proposal. The evaluation factors that comprise the technical proposal package are, in descending order of importance: (1) Project Experience and Past Performance, (2) Scheduling and Cost Management, (3) Management and Technical Approach, (4) Key Personnel and Staffing, (5) Current Project Location. The technical factors are significantly more important than price. As proposals become more equal in the technical merits, price becomes more important. <br /><br />The procurement will include a wide range of construction projects over the period of performance utilizing the design-bid-build task order contract approach with optional CMc services. Primarily, task orders will consist of repair/alteration and tenant finish projects for the GSA and other government agencies in occupied federally owned or leased buildings. A typical task order could contain some or all of the following: modifications to architectural components and related electrical systems associated with, but not limited to ceilings, walls, floors (including access floor systems), roofing systems, millwork and wall covering. Work may also include modifications and replacement of mechanical systems to include, but not be limited to: air handling units, chillers, boilers, ductwork systems and accessories, piping systems (including pumps), HVAC system controls, fire protection sprinkler systems and accessories, and plumbing equipment/accessories. In addition, scope may also include work on electrical systems including, but not limited to lighting systems, primary and secondary power distribution systems and transformers. Special competencies will be required for any work involving membrane roofing, asbestos abatement, PCB removal and/or elevator work. Interested parties must be capable of providing the services associated with the aforementioned competencies. <br /><br />The Contractor's principal tasks may include, but are not limited to: field verification and site investigations, required testing, reviewing designs, preparing cost estimates, reviewing cost estimates, providing schedules, keeping records, reporting on progress, resolving problems, conducting value engineering exercises, performing constructability reviews, submittals, coordination of all documents and requirements, promptly reporting to the Contracting Officer any ambiguities or discrepancies found in the project requirements or documents, coordination of all activities, coordination of all meetings, construction, maintaining daily logs, weekly and monthly reports, administration of all subcontracts, administration and execution of quality control plan, commissioning, performing administrative collection of sustainable design and construction-related materials and processes, construction waste recycling receipts, compliance with applicable building codes and regulations, and other services as defined in the Contract Documents.<br /><br />The GSA defines CMc as a contract method/arrangement in which a firm contracts directly with a building owner to provide pre-construction services as well as general construction and construction administration services. The CMc will be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with GSA, GSA's selected A-E firm and other designated GSA consultants. The CMc will provide professional, technical, administrative and clerical personnel, as needed, to perform all required services to renovate the building, including, but not limited to, those described in the future notice to be posted to FedBizOpps. <br /><br />It is anticipated that future services of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities, which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs). The CMc must maintain a team with the expertise and capability to manage and coordinate the timely and orderly development and construction of the proposed project. The CMc will be required to assign, as needed, a team consisting of architectural, civil, structural, mechanical and electrical reviewers; cost estimators; CPM analysts; field engineers; field support staff; construction supervisors; construction superintendents; testing engineers/technicians; and other disciplines, as needed. <br /><br />Required Pre-Construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, review and evaluation of the concept, design development and construction document submission for constructability, value engineering suggestions, identification of any problems or errors in the design documentation, consultation during construction document production, preliminary project schedule development, primary cost estimates during design development and construction documents, and development of subcontractor and supplier interest. <br /><br />Required Construction Phase Services shall include, but are not limited to, renovation and conversion of the building in accordance with the specifications, administration of the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordination of regular construction meetings, critical path method (CPM) scheduling, maintenance of construction records including daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, and turnover to designated facility management staff, performing administrative collection of sustainable design and construction-related materials and processes, construction waste recycling receipts, and other required supplemental services as requested by GSA. The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, and the principles of Federal construction and contract administration.<br /><br />The CMc services may be delivered using a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP). GMP is defined as the lump sum for the Contractor's construction phase services, the cost of the work, general conditions, construction contingency, and the fee. The contractor guarantees this lump sum amount. The GMP may be converted to a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) at an amount that is mutually agreeable to both the Contractor and the Government.<br /><br />Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) and the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database are available for use by all Federal agencies. You must be registered with CCR before registering with FedBizOpps. No federal material can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites. The solicitation will be available through the Federal Business Opportunities website (FedBizOpps.gov). FedBizOpps is a secure website designed to safeguard sensitive but unclassified (SBU) acquisition information. You may access FedBizOpps via the following address: www.fedbizopps.gov. You will then be required to register as a vendor by selecting the "register now" hyperlink. At a minimum all vendors must supply the following information: Your Company DUNS Number (contact Dun &amp; Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 for a free DUNS Number if you do not have one), Your Company Information and Personal Information. It is the vendor's responsibility to monitor FedBizOpps for any changes and/or conditions. <br /><br />The use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) is required in Federal solicitations as part of the bid submission process, thereby eliminating the need to submit a paper copy of Representations and Certifications with each offer. Please enter and maintain your representation and certification information via the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. Once there you will find detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance. To prepare for and register in ORCA you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) as identified in the CCR record.<br /><br />The base contract and task orders issued as a result of this solicitation will include Buy American Act clauses. As a result, one or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.<br /><br />The Contracting Officer for this procurement is Christopher Cox, 816-926-7894, christopher.cox@gsa.gov. The alternate Contracting Officers for this procurement are Michael Flanigan, 816-823-4912, michael.flanigan@gsa.gov and Chad Jasper, 816-823-2171, chad.jasper@gsa.gov.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Government currently leases 13,952 ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet of office space located at 1110 Montlimar Drive, Mobile, AL 36609, under a lease scheduled to expire January 31, 2012.  The Government intends to negotiate a ten (10) year, five (5) year firm lease at this location at the same square footage based on economic advantage, agency mission, and other factors.  The Government will only consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.  All services, supplies, utilities and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration.
<p>EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST: If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information to Alexandra Chagares, Jones Lang LaSalle, at alexandra.chagares@am.jll.com by 5:00 pm EDT, Friday, November 18, 2011.</p>

<DESC>The Office of the Program Manager - Saudi Arabian National Guard Modernization Program (OPM-SANG), located in Riyadh Saudi Arabia, intends to procure a Job Order Contract (JOC) Unit Price Book and technical specifications to be utilized for a new Job Order Contract to be established for construction projects in vicinity of Riyadh. Essentially this is two requirements: <br><br>a. Procure Unit Price Book - the Saudi Arabian-specific price book must be purchased by the Government and provided to potential offerors for the eventual multiple-award JOC. Ideally, the Unit Price Book purchased is part of an overall software package eventually used by the Government to also develop the technical specifications for the new task orders (after the JOC has been awarded).<br><br>b. Establish a Job Order Contract - establish a pool of multiple contractors with the technical capability to complete an array of minor construction tasks at reasonable and realistic prices.<br><br>See attachment for full requirement description.

<p>Program Overview</p>
<p>The Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) is seeking information to improve overall support of our Information Technology acquisitions. These initiatives are for Information Technology labor services to support the entire agency and will result in three acquisitions. The Software Acquisition Directorate operates as a center for application development, maintenance, testing, sustainment, and deployment of DCMA unique systems including Mechanization of Contract Administration Services (MOCAS), Shared Data Warehouse (SDW) and the DCMA Service Center. DCMA places high priority on ensuring that applications meet Agency requirements and are stable, reliable and secure.</p>
<p>Scope of Project</p>
<p>Three acquisitions to be awarded will be for the following IT efforts:</p>
<p>1) Software Development and Environmental Support - referred to as the Primary Integrator contractor S5105A-12-R-0002<br />2) Software Development and Database Support - referred to as the Primary Database contractor S5105A-12-Q-0001<br />3) Lifecycle Support/Software Development - referred to as the Primary Application Development contractor S5105A-12-Q-0002</p>

<p><br />*** NEW TECHNOLOGY/DEVICES UNDER DEVELOPMENT***</p>
<p>For products under development, describe the current stage of development and whether the product has undergone independent laboratory testing or FDA testing/trials etc.</p>
<p>Firms and organizations that currently develop or manufacture auto-injectors described in this RFI or that have technologies, devices or manufacturing capabilities under development are invited to submit information to DLA Troop Support. Data obtained from this RFI will be used by DLA Troop Support in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate planning and procurement strategy for auto-injectors.

<DESC>Sources Sought. This is the public notice for acquisitions over $10,000. The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), located in Miami, FL intends to issue a fixed price type contract for services to distribute sea turtle tags and management of Cooperative Marine Turtle Tagging Program (CMTTP). The period of performance of the base year will be 4/1/2012 through 3/31/2013, with 4, 12-month option years, making the anticipated performance period of the contract effective through 3/31/2017. It is the Government's intent to award a contract on a sole source basis to the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL. Until April 1999 there were two sea turtle tag distribution and archival centers for the Western North Atlantic: NMFS Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) and the University of Florida Archie Carr Center for Sea Turtle Research. The Archie Carr Center distributed tags to many collaborators in all areas of the world since 1955, having distributed over 200,000 tags. They have established an internationally known database system and communication network. Individuals of that network communicate throughout the world with local fishermen and other citizens and help to arrange for the return of tags from captured turtles. NMFS had maintained its CMTTP since 1980 and had distributed about 100,000 tags. In April 1999, NMFS consolidated its database with that of the Archie Carr Center, transferring funds to the Center to support the purchasing of tags and for managing the consolidated database. The purpose of this acquisition is to support the consolidated activities of the two groups. This service eliminates the duplication of necessary infrastructure, saving federal dollars, and minimizes the duplication of tag identification numbers among programs and confusion associated with returning recovered tags to two separate entities. Services include but are not limited to: The purchase and distribution of tags and applicators according to NMFS/CMTTP tagging protocol (http://accstr.ufl.edu/cmttp:html); Recovery costs of tags and applicators from organizations requesting tags, when possible; Maintain database for tag distribution records and webpage for tag distribution inventory (http://accstr.ufl.edu/taginv.html); Archive, as hard copy or electronic files, all tagging data submitted by the cooperating tagging programs; Maintain the databases for tag releases; Maintain the databases of recovery records from recaptured turtles; Continue to reorganize and improve database structure to facilitate use by NMFS SEFSC; Disseminate data to "data owners" (per CMTTP policy) as requested; Facilitate the sharing of tagging information among researchers; Provide NMFS SEFSC Lab with access to the databases; email NMFS SEFSC updated database files on request; Maintain the CMTTP webpage (http://accstr.ufl.edu/cmttp.html); Provide annual summary of activities. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the Authority of FAR 6.302. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This sources sought is not a request for competitive responses. However, all responses received within seven calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Responses can be sent via email to: jackie.a.shewmaker@noaa.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications; and sufficient information that describes or demonstrates the firms knowledge of the CMTTP and its policies; provides a discussion on the firms experience that demonstrates its capability for maintaining a database for tag distribution, records and inventory; a plan for transferring data, loading data and maintaining a database for tag distribution, records, and inventory. Interested firms shall describe their ability to disseminate data and facilitate the sharing of tagging information among researchers. Only affirmative responses to this notice will be evaluated to the extent necessary for the Government to determine whether it is feasible to conduct a competitive acquisition considering demonstrated knowledge and experience. Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide the required services as stated herein. If no affirmative responses are received, the government intends to award a contract to the University of Florida. DOC, EAD requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No contract/purchase order can be made to a company not registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division - Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with DAVIS WIRE PRODUCTS LTD. For an economical, one-handed balloon launch pay out reel or unwinder with 120 feet of string to support up to 5.5 pound packages of ozonesonde and water vapor instrumentation. A reliable, but inexpensive, balloon launch reel is critical when considering the value of the payload it is assisting in launching. Each ozonesonde launch costs approximately $700. When a water vapor sensor is added to the suite, the cost is $2,600. If a balloon launch reel fails or slips and allows the payload to fall, the typical result is the sensors smashing into the ground and breaking without possibility of repair. <br /><br />***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric (NOAA) market research and expert knowledge in determining that DAVIS WIRE PRODUCTS LTD. is a unique source to fulfill this need based on the company's inexpensive unique proven product and past performance. The Request for Information (RFI) NRMJ1000-10-04558WGC yielded no workable, economical solutions to the government's requirement other than the one proposed by DAVIS WIRE PRODUCTS LTD.<br /><br />***This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $150K). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 10 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement, a market survey for written information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. 

The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWCPCD) is seeking information on shipboard fastening hardware concepts for use on skirt systems of U.S. Navy Hovercraft, such as Landing Craft Air-Cushion (LCAC).  A LCAC skirt system is a flexible, rubber-coated fabric that captures pressurized air under the hull to reduce drag and provide amphibious capability.
  It is held together with over 1000 individual fasteners.  While the current fastener system maintains high reliability, it requires a pneumatic tensioner device for installation and is difficult to remove for replacement of the skirt components.  

The desired system will utilize common hand tools for installation and removal to reduce maintenance and repair efforts, thereby increasing combat readiness and reducing life cycle maintenance costs.  Two grip ranges are desired: 0.312-in to 1.250-in, and 0.750-in to 1.625-in.  The fastener diameter should be 0.25-in for compatibility with existing systems.  The weight of the systems should be kept to a minimum, as the subject craft is very weight sensitive.
 It is desirable that the vendor be able to provide the minimum tensile strength for the proposed fastener.  Additionally, the components must be corrosion resistant and capable of use in the maritime environment.   

This announcement will serve as a first step for evaluating alternatives and supporting testing efforts planned for fiscal year 2012.  This search is restricted to current, off-the-shelf approaches that could be acquired for immediate Test and Evaluation and future installation onboard a U.S. Navy Hovercraft.

Responses to this announcement should include a technical description and detailed characteristics of the fastener system for use on the skirt system of LCAC or a similar craft.
  System descriptions should have enough information for the government to make informed decisions regarding the concepts applicability.  Information submitted shall be marked with restrictive legends as deemed appropriate by the potential vendor.  Data with restrictive markings will be handled in accordance with the restrictions thereto.  Interested parties must provide paper submittals with copies on disks in MS Word or Adobe Acrobat format.  The government will evaluate the submittals for their potential to provide an improved skirt system fastening system.  Organizations that submit materials/designs, which are determined by the evaluation team as possessing significant potential for contributing to the solution of the fastening problem, may be provided an opportunity to demonstrate their system.
  Technical questions should be directed to Mr. Rob Cole at (850) 235-5947 (email Robert.e.cole1@navy.mil ).  Mailing address for submissions is:   Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, Code E32, ATTN: Robert E. Cole, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001 or email: Robert.e.cole1@navy.mil.  Responses to this sources sought should be sent to the address stated above not later than 30 January 2012.  This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or to ultimately award a contract.  In the event a solicitation is developed, it will be assigned a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) number and the announcement will be published on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) NAICS 339993.

The current contract is driven by the number of samples. The sample pricing is loaded with equipment maintenance, Full time equivalents (FTE) and supplies. Although all components are related to the success of the mission, the cost realism of the samples are not captured.
<p>The Government is seeking to recompete the expiring laboratory analysis and collection requirement currently performed by MRI under requirements contract number HQ0034-07-D-1009. All FTEs performing on this effort require at a minimum a SECRET Clearances.</p>
<p>The Government desires to restructure the existing requirement. In efforts to execute this requirement, the Government intends to separate the laboratory sample collection/ anaylsis and equipment maintenance from the supplies required for the mission.</p>
<p>The Government solicits responses to this notice from all sources to include small businesses (including small businesses in all socio-economic categories) teams, and joint ventures. The purpose of this sources sought is to request feedback from industry about capability of accomplishing this requirement as follows:</p>
<p>Option A: Split Services and supplies<br />This option puts the analysis, collection and equipment maintenance on a single contract then procuring the supplies for the lab as a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) or Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ).</p>
<p>Contract #1: New Analysis/Collection CLIN Structure Contract:<br />0001 Laboratory Analysis-This CLIN will focus on the FTE required to analyze the projected samples. The contractor would propose number of FTE and hourly rates / contract years<br />0002 Laboratory Collection-This CLIN will focus on cost to pick-up/deliver samples to designated location.<br />0003 Equipment Maintenance- This CLIN will focus on the required maintenance performance by authorized vendors to maintain system operation in compliance with the applicable ISO standards.</p>
<p>Contract #2: New BPA or ID/IQ Structure Contract:<br />This contract will be competed amongst prospective contractors to provide competitive pricing for the list of supplies required for the operation of the CBRN laboratory. After award, Calls/Orders will be placed against BPA or ID/IQ for the supplies. The orders could be executed by the COR (if the order value is under $3,000) then AD executes all order above $3,000 OR AD could execute all order against the BPA or ID/IQ. The expected delivery turnaround for supplies would be a least 7 days.</p>
<p>Option B: Create 3 separate contracts <br />This option allows each requirement to stand alone.<br />Contract #1: Analysis/Collection<br />Contract #2: Equipment Maintenance <br />Contract #3: Laboratory Supplies</p>

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Natick Soldier System Center (NSSC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to:  Ridgeline Industries, 745 Graves Street, Clayton, NY 13624-1503   <br><br>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <br><br>1.	 FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) Solicitations may be limited to one source only if the contracting officer determines that only one source is reasonably available.  This determination must be supported with full justification for sole source from the customer.  When the customer describes an item with a purchase description that limits the availability to one source, the justification must explain why the item is the only one that will meet the government's requirement. Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  The customer shall provide the following information:<br>2.	Brief description of supplies or services required and the intended use.<br><br>One Hundered and Four (104) EA Green 3K Insulated Water Bag Cover Assemblies, NIIN: 01-532-3841 which are critical components of the Force Provider Reset Winterization Kit urgently needed in theater (Afghanistan) for the approaching winter season for the Force Provider 600-man modules being deployed.<br><br> 3. Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used:<br>Due to significant issues with the specification, the ability to order this material has been significantly delayed but the need for a portion of the total requirement cannot be late.  The cause for the delay is that the insulating material called out in the original specification did not meet new testing standards released by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). Significant and unavoidable delays occurred as the configuration control manager for the item had to go through a process to determine an acceptable alternative.<br><br>4. Reason that suggested source is the only source which can provide the supplies or services:    <br>The configuration control manager approved one alternative, "Reflectix", for use. There is a total field requirement for 1040 of these Insulated Water Bag Cover Assembles, 104 of which are needed urgently. There is only one company known, Ridgeline Industries, that has produced the item, and can meet the required delivery schedule of 6 weeks with the required quantity of 104 each. This is the only avenue to meet the urgent requirement.  <br><br>5.   A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<br>The Government investigated several other sources for the materials, all of whom offered materials that failed to meet the new specification.<br><br>6.   Explain why an adequate purchase description or other information suitable to solicit by full and open competition has not been developed or are not available:<br>Specifications were recently finalized, after technical difficulties but this product must be ordered immediately to ensure timely delivery to deployed personnel for the minimum quantity of 104 required.<br><br>7.   Provide a statement of actions, if any, the government may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before future acquisitions are required.  If this is a follow-on action to a previously competed action, so state:  <br>Now that the specification issues have been resolved, the Government will attempt to discover other sources for complying materials for the remaining 936 that will be required in theater via full and open competition.<br><br>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: greg.n.wilson@us.army.mil no later than 4:30p.m. on November 17, 2011. <br><br><br><br>Contracting Office Address: <br>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<br>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<br>Kansas Street, Building 1<br>Natick, MA 01760-5011<br><br>Point of Contact:<br>Greg Wilson, Contract Specialist<br>Greg.N.Wilson@us.army.mil<br>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Total Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-1886 <br />Name: Tape, Vinyl Backing, Rubber Adhesive, Yellow, 36 yds <br />Description: Floor safety aisle marking tape, 2" W x 108 ft. roll. Solid yellow, vinyl, resists abrasion, moisture and weather. Mark off traffic areas, physical hazards and work sites with this attention-getting adhesive-backed tape. UOI is RO.</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-1890<br />Name: Tape, Safety Stripe, Rubber Adhesive, Black/White, 36 yds<br />Description: Floor safety striped tape, 2" W x 108 ft. roll. Black/White stripe, vinyl, resists abrasion, moisture and weather. Mark off traffic areas, physical hazards and work sites with this attention-getting adhesive-backed tape. UOI is RO.</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-1891<br />Name: Tape, Safety Stripe, Rubber Adhesive, Black/Yellow, 36 yds<br />Description: Floor Safety Striped Tape, 2" W x 108 ft. Roll, Black/Yellow Stripe, Vinyl - Resists abrasion, moisture and weather. Mark off traffic areas, physical hazards and work sites with this attention-getting adhesive-backed tape. UOI is EA.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-1886 <br />Similar Items: MMM 471- 2-YELLOW; Uline S-386, Incom PST210 (Fastenal part #1014652); Grainger 2A678 (3M 471); Brady 58200 (Grainger 6N810); Grainger 6FXW0, Grainger 6FXU6</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-1890<br />Similar Items: MMM57002; Uline S-13512; Incom 1014652 (Fastenal part #1014659); Brady 55292; Brady 104319 (Fastenal part #1031847)</p>
<p>NSN: 7510-00-NIB-1891<br />Similar Items: MMM57022; MMM7622; TCO14711; SPR11794; Uline S-2183; Brady 55302 (Grainger 6N779); Grainger 2A682 (MMM57022); Grainger 6FXV5; Grainger 6FXV7; Grainger 82CM6 (LB11571Y); Incom WT2110 (Fastenal part #1014657)</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 30, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC><p>Synopsis: <br />THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A SOLICITATION. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this Special Notice; all costs associated with responding to this Special Notice will be solely at the interested party's expense.</p>
<p>Description: The Office of Naval Research (ONR) plans to conduct a workshop to present a new program for the Autonomous Aerial Cargo / Utility Vehicle (AACUS) Innovative Naval Prototype. Industry participation in this workshop is encouraged in order to promote discussion of relevant current state-of-the art technologies, potential technical and sociotechnical gaps, and Broad Agency Announcement teaming possibilities.</p>
<p>The primary focus of AACUS is to develop advanced autonomous capabilities to enable unmanned and optionally manned VTOL air systems to be fully capable of providing affordable and reliable rapid response cargo delivery to distributed small units in demanding conditions. AACUS will lead the way in developing and implementing VTOL-based obstacle detection and avoidance and autonomous landing site selection and dynamic execution capabilities for unprepared landing sites, with goal-based supervisory control by any field personnel with no special training. These capabilities, expected to form part of an open architecture framework in order to be used across different VTOL platforms, should have sufficient reliability to be entrusted with precision cargo delivery and evacuating human casualties from remote sites.</p>
<p>The purpose of the workshop is to provide an overview of AACUS for FY12-FY17 including expected milestones, deliverables, demonstrations, and approximate funding levels. A preliminary concept of operations (CONOPS) will be posted to the ONR website in advance of the workshop. Participants from a cross-section of industry, government laboratories, FFRDCs, and academia are encouraged to attend. However, all workshop participants will be expected to present, in an open setting, their areas of expertise that they see contributing to the AACUS program. These presentations will take the form of 5-10 minute presentations and/or poster presentations depending on the interest level.</p>
<p>The workshop will be held at the Crowne Plaza Washington National Airport, 1480 Crystal Dr.<br />Arlington, VA 22202, 703-416-1600, www.cpnationalairport.com, on 1-2 November 2011. Check-in will begin at 7:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time and the meeting will begin at 8:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time both days. The meeting will conclude each day at 4:30 PM. There will be a no-host networking reception on the 1 of November, venue to be announced at a later date. Details concerning registration to attend this event are available at the following website: http://www.onr.navy.mil.</p>
<p>Pre-registration for the ONR AACUS Industry Workshop is required. Walk-ins will not be permitted. Registration is limited to two (2) representatives from each organization attending the Industry Workshop. However if requested attendance exceeds the capacity of the conference room, it may be necessary to further limit attendance of personnel from each organization to just one (1). ONR will reply via e-mail with the registration confirmation. All expenses associated with attendance will be the responsibility of the participant(s). Registration by telephone will not be accepted. Security clearances are not required and all discussions will be unclassified. The deadline for submitting registration requests is 28 OCT 2011 at 4:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time.</p>
<p>Parties interested in submitting proposals in response to any future solicitation regarding the subject of this workshop are advised that they must be in compliance with the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) at the time of proposal submission.</p>
<p>Questions/comments related to the AACUS INP Workshop will be accepted via e-mail until 27 October 2011. Submit questions/comments to the following e-mail address: Angelo Collins, collinsa@centratechnology.com. Questions/comments shall be reviewed and addressed at the workshop.</p>
<p>Related questions/comments submitted after the AACUS INP Workshop will be accepted via Angelo Collins (collinsa@centratechnology.com) from the date of workshop conclusion on 2 November 2011 until 23 November 2011. This limited time frame for questions/comments is to allow for potential feedback to be incorporated into any resulting BAA /solicitation.

Point of contact Jessica Ely, Contract Specialist, e-mail: Jessica.ely@us.army.mil<br><br>The following verbiage is directly from the Justification and Approval for sole source and is posted in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6).<br><br>The Edstrom automated watering system is required to replace the exisitng Edstrom watering system.  In utilizing the same brand equipment, many of the current pieces of the equipment will be re-utilized in the new automated watering system.  By remaning with the manufacturer of the exisiting system, the Government is able to see a monetary savings in utilizing some of the exisiting equipment, as well as a reduction in mission loss days due to the renovations.

<DESC>This notice is to all parties expressing an interest in the United States Secret Service (USSS) Request For Information HSSS01-09-RFI-0001 "Block 1: IT Infrastructure Modernization, Database Architecture and Maintenance and Cyber Security" (Block 1) initiative posted October 16, 2009 on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) and the subsequent FBO Special Notice titled "Information Integration and Transformation - Pre-Block One - Study, Analysis and Stabilization" posted March 5, 2010 under solicitation number HSSS01-10-J-0041. The HSSS01-10-J-0041 solicitation envisioned an acquisition via the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) EAGLE contract that would provide the USSS with a study, analysis and equipment stabilization effort. This solicitation was subsequently cancelled, but with the expectation that the Government's needs would be fulfilled by other methods.<br />
<p><br />The USSS currently expects to perform multiple predecessor acquisitions in advance of the complete initiative. The purpose of these separate tasks will be the rapid acquisition of hardware and software elements and their installation, configuration and integration into the current USSS IT infrastructure. These acquisitions are to ensure that current IT assets continue to function effectively and seamlessly while the remainder of the initiative proceeds through the various phases of the acquisition process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These initial predecessor acquisitions are presently planned to be conducted via an existing U.S. Government acquisition vehicle for efficiency purposes. Current expectations are to conduct these separate tasks via the DHS FirstSource contract vehicle. This notice is provided as guidance only for the information of interested parties and is subject to change. Additional FirstSource contract information, including contract awardees' information, may be found at:</p>

<p>http://www.dhs.gov/xopnbiz/opportunities/gc_1249920282614.shtm</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The USSS continues to plan for the IT Infrastructure Modernization, Database Architecture and Maintenance and Cyber Security initiative to be acquired via an anticipated unrestricted open market acquisition conducted via FBO. The USSS encourages interested parties to frequently monitor FBO for future notices of the complete initiative.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE - THIS IS A NOTICE OF THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE AWARD TO CACI-CMS INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INC. FOR CONTINUATION OF EXISTING MISSION ESSENTIAL WORK FOR THE OSD COMMUNITY.
<p>Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) Acquisition Directorate intends to extend the performance period on contract HQ0034-10-C-0057 issued to CACI-CMS Information Systems, Inc. the incumbent contractor, on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>The existing contract with CACI-CMS Information Systems, Inc. will be extended for four (4) months from 01 JAN 2012 through 30 APR 2012, and will include two (2) one-month option periods. The options are being included to allow the Government to extend the performance period on a month-to-month basis in the event that the award and/or performance under the follow-on competitive awards is delayed. The clause at FAR 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, will also be included into this extension.</p>
<p>This contract will provide for an approximate 30-day transition phase with performance currently projected to commence 01 APR 2012 under the follow-on competitive task orders, resulting from the award of the basic multiple award contracts from the Net-Centric Integrated Enterprise Information Technology Solutions (NIEITS) solicitation, HQ0034-10-R-0046.</p>
<p>The delay in issuing the follow-on competitive task orders is due to the extended litigation regarding the above awards and solicitation, which was reviewed by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The Court rendered a decision on 31 OCT 2011 in favor of the Government. Based on the Court's decision, the Government is proceeding with the follow-on competitive task orders. Therefore, this action is necessary in order to maintain continuity of vital mission essential recurring services for IT systems and business applications, affecting operations within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Pentagon, and National Capital Region.</p>
<p>Operations services include IT Helpdesk, Server and Desktop Operations, Asset Management, Information Assurance, Governance and Configuration Management, Security Services, and Applications Development and Support. Engineering services provide for system patches, upgrades, changes, repair of systemic problems, and facilitate transition to the OSD Target Architecture, including transitioning servers to the Army's Information Technology Agency. Both the Operations and Engineering services provide support to a customer base of approximately 6,500 users. The user base is located throughout the National Capital Region; primarily in the Pentagon, Rosslyn, Crystal City, and the Mark Center.</p>
<p>CACI-CMS Information Systems, Inc. is the only source that can provide uninterrupted service with no degradation in support within the timeframes discussed in this memorandum as they hold critical knowledge and expertise which are vital to the continued operations of the IT infrastructure, business applications, and processes, while the Government completes the awards for the follow-on acquisition. If this extension is awarded to a new contractor, major disruptions will occur as the new contractor learns to operate and maintain the numerous unique and specialized applications within a very short period of time and for a very short period of time. Award to any other source during this interim period would result in a lapse in service which would result in mission failure.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition pending award of the follow-on contract would be advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be issued without further notice. Interested parties may identify their capabilities with respect to this requirement by Tuesday, 29 NOV 2011, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. All information received will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541513 with a size standard of $25.0 million.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.

Brand Name Justification:  Juniper Hardware Maintenance Renewal

This brand name justification is for the negotiation and issuance of an open market order to acquire Juniper Hardware Maintenance renewals for the Pearl Harbor, Portsmouth, and Puget Sound Naval Shipyards.

The Shipyards are currently using the Juniper hardware.
  Juniper is the publisher of this proprietary equipment and is the only vendor capable of maintaining it.  Hardware maintenance is the right to software upgrades and replacement units if necessary.  Juniper and its licensed resellers are the only firms that have the source code and therefore the only firms to offer hardware maintenance.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protests issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer of Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), United States Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 2100 2ND Street, SW, Stop 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202-372-3695.</p>

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p><br />(a) Contract line item is incrementally funded. For this item, the sum of $1132 of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause.</p>
<p>(b) For item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government." As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s).</p>
<p>(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government."</p>
<p>(d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.</p>
<p>(e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled "Disputes."</p>
<p>(f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.</p>
<p>(g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled "Default." The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.</p>
<p>(h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled "Termination for Convenience of the Government."</p>
<p>(i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.</p>
<p>(j) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule:</p>
<p><br />On execution of contract<br />$ 566 <br />November 21, 2011<br />$ 566</p>

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

In accordance with HSAR 3052.228-70, Insurance (DEC 2003), the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with proof of insurance for the duration of the contract, including: 1. Ship Repairer's Liability - $500,000 per occurrence., 2. Comprehensive General Liability - $500,000 per occurrence., 3. Full insurance coverage in accordance with the United States' Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act., 4. Full insurance coverage in accordance with the State's Workmen's Compensation Law (or its equivalent) for all places of performance under this contract. The insurance certificate must provide the name of the US Coast Guard vessel and the contract and/or solicitation number as specifically insured. WELDING CERTIFICATIONS AND QUALIFICATIONS - This solicitation may contain welding line items as either Definitive or Optional Items. With his/her quote the Contractor shall provide the necessary welding certifications and qualifications as required by the specification for the applicable work item(s), and SFLC Standard Specification 0740_STD. MAY BE CONSIDERED INCOMPLETE AND MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED QUOTES MUST INCLUDE ALL DOCUMENTS REQUESTED IN THIS SOLICITATION (WELDING CERTIFICATES, DRYDOCK CERTIFICATION, PAST PERFORMANCE, ETC). QUOTES THAT DO NOT INCLUDE ALL DOCUMENTS REQUESTED GROWTH WORK (a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated. (b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal. (c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC. COMPOSITE LABOR RATE: -The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract. (a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following: (1) direct labor wages and salaries;(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies; (6) profit (fee); and(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions: Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating; Material Handling Housekeeping; Engineering Transportation/Drivers; Quality Assurance Contract Administration; Security Testing (b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated. (c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. To further this policy, the Commandant has created the position of Solicitation Ombudsman who is empowered to investigate issues raised by prospective offerors and resolve them, where possible, without expensive and time-consuming litigation. Potential quoters who believe that a Coast Guard solicitation is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the quoter should then contact the Coast Guard Solicitation Ombudsman at the address below: Commandant (CG-9131),United States Coast Guard Headquarters, Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0203,Washington, DC 20593-0001,Telephone: (202) 372-3695, Fax: (202) 475-3904 Potential quoters should provide the following information to the Ombudsman in order to ensure a timely response: Solicitation number, Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States government's top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country and the Afghan government.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI launched a new program in Afghanistan in July 2009, in line with US Government priorities. The program implements civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, during the shape, clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. The program seeks to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects. In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partners manages an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities focus on stability assistance, which incorporates a range of sectors, including, but not limited to, irrigation and small infrastructure, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, and small livelihood activities. All activities are community driven and strive to address sources of instability which often includes increasing the legitimacy of GIRoA.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<SUBJECT>Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS)
<SOLNBR>RFI-WNS-JTCTRS
<NTYPE>SRCSGT
<RESPDATE>112211
<CONTACT>Thomas D. Sharkey, Contract Negotiator, Phone (937) 255-2666, Fax (937) 656-7538, Email Thomas.Sharkey@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><strong>Request for Information and Sources Sought<br />Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System</strong> <br /><br />This is a request for information, issued for the purpose of identifying potential sources with the capability to accomplish the effort described herein. The ASC/WNS (Simulators Division) will be competing the Joint Terminal Control Training and Rehearsal System (JTC TRS) with deliveries beginning in fiscal year (FY) 2013. Our primary interface with industry will be the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) (https://www.fbo.gov/) site. We anticipate releasing the Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) for industry comment in early calendar year (CY) 2012 and expect contract award in late 2012 or early 2013. If you have any questions or comments, please contact Tom Sharkey, Contract Negotiator, at 937-255-2666, email: thomas.sharkey@wpafb.af.mil.<br /><br />This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government does not presently intend to award a contract based on responses to this RFI, but is in need of information on potential sources for a system in support of the Combat Air Forces' (CAF), Special Operations Commands' (SOCOM), and Air Force Special Operations Commands' (AFSOC) Tactical Air Control Party and Combat Controllers in performance of Terminal Control, Terminal Guidance, Close Air Support and Joint Fires operations. The potential exists for the future contract to also provide systems to support the Marine Corp ANGLICO's, US Army Forward Observers / Joint Fires Observers and various units throughout SOCOM. This RFI is intended to help the government formulate the acquisition strategy and schedule. <br /><br />JTC TRS is an OSD derived program designed to fulfill an immediate need for realistic training and mission rehearsal for Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC), Joint Fires Support, and Air Traffic Control in a simulated and controlled environment. The anticipated system(s) will be used to train basic procedures in the schoolhouse environment as well as mission rehearsal in large scale exercises. Mission rehearsal capabilities to practice, validate, and verify Joint Doctrine Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) are essential. This training capability provides direct support to Overseas Contingency and Combat Operations. Both manual real time control and automated simulation of airborne assets is required. Multiple configurations of the basic training system are anticipated which include a fixed version and a portable version suitable for forward deployment and/or ship board operations. The fixed-platform version will be configurable to suit student groups in a school house environment, team training and individual mission rehearsal. Instructor Operator Station(s), robust simulated threat environment, simulated natural environment, and Brief/Debrief Systems are all required subsystems. The military services are investing heavily in high fidelity, globally networked, combat mission simulations to provide training in virtual environments that approach live operations. All services are stressing interoperability as a basic requirement. By the time JTC TRS is expected to be fielded, many air-to-ground platforms will have simulators that are fully network interoperable. <br /><br />This requirement drives visual simulation requirements, geographically accurate visual databases, high fidelity representations of weapons systems that interact with JTACs, and high fidelity simulation of weapons effects. Each JTAC site will connect into the Distributed Mission Operations Network (DMON) as well as other service and joint networks. This will require the JTC TRS to comply with CAF DMO Interoperability Standards (described at http://www.dmodmt.com/) and follow the guidelines of CJCSI 6212.01C. An associate contract agreement with the DMON network provider and other simulator manufacturers will be required in support of distributed mission integration.<br /><br />The JTC TRS acquisition strategy was planned to be "build-to-print" based on a Production Representative Article (PRA); however, the PRA does not meet all of the requirements of the Government Performance Specification (PSpec). The Government intends to set aside a period of the contract period of performance for the development and test of an engineering development model before a Milestone C production decision is made.<br /><br />Detailed performance requirements can be found in the attached notional PSpec. Please note that this attachment may be updated. The Government anticipates scheduling both industry days and&nbsp;PRA demonstration days prior to RFP release. The USAF has a requirement for at least 55 systems to be delivered beginning in FY13 through FY19. The Government anticipates a contractor logistics support concept for the CAF. All systems will be housed in Government facilities. Government-contracted instructor/operators will support assets acquired for SOCOM/AFSOC under a separate contract. <br /><br />In response to this RFI, please provide the following information:<br /><br />1. A description of your company, including address, CAGE Code, DUNS and Point of Contact information and your intentions for competing for this award.<br /><br />2. A description of your company's experience in developing and deploying high fidelity training devices and simulations for combat training, including a description of your experience in networking simulators and working with interoperability mechanisms such as Distributed Interactive Simulation and High Level Architecture protocols<br /><br />3. A description of your capability to develop, produce, test, and support a training system that meets the basic requirements described in the attached draft Government PSpec. Include information about your software development, manufacturing and production capabilities (including any ISO, CMMI or other certifications that you have achieved), as well as any subcontractor/teaming relationships that might pertain to this effort.<br /><br />4. Provide an estimate of the length of time that your company would require to either complete the PRA development or provide your own solution that would meet the requirements of the PSpec. Address any risks that you foresee in completing the limited development using the PRA versus proposing your own solution.<br /><br />5. A description of your company's capabilities and experiences in the worldwide deployment and support of complex training systems. Assuming a contract award in the 1st quarter of CY13, how soon could your company deliver an operational trainer to a CONUS/OCONUS location, and how many systems per year can your company deploy?<br /><br />6. A description of your company's experience integrating disparate simulation software and hardware into an immersive mission training system with emulated equipment.<br /><br />7. Identification of the top five risks you foresee in executing an acquisition of this scope.<br /><br />8. Comments to the attached Government performance specification. The Government is especially interested in the technology challenges each offeror sees in the draft performance description, as well as any areas where the PSpec does not provide sufficient detail for any requirement that would allow a JTAC to complete a training activity or mission rehearsal. Your inputs will be evaluated to determine if changes are required to the performance spec.<br /><br />9. Any other relevant topics, concerns, and information that will help the Government in forming an acquisition strategy.<br /><br />10. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is expected to be 541512, with a size standard of $23M. Indicate whether you are a large or small business in relation to NAICS 541512 and if small, your small business type (Small, SDB, etc.).<br /><br />Technical questions may be directed to Kenneth Millard, Program Manager at 937-255-4786, email: kenneth.millard@wpafb.af.mil. Contractual questions may be directed to Tom Sharkey, Contract Negotiator, at 937-255-2666, email: thomas.sharkey@wpafb.af.mil. Formal responses should be e-mailed (preferred), faxed or mailed to: ASC/WNSK (Attn: Tom Sharkey) 2300 D Street, Bldg 32 Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7249 e-mail: thomas.sharkey@wpafb.af.mil. FAX: (937) 656-7538.<br /><br />Responses are requested no later than close of business on 22 Nov 11. Given the need for a rapid response to this RFI, lengthy and elaborate presentation material and explanations are discouraged. Marketing materials are not a sufficient response to this RFI. Please limit responses to no more than 10 pages, excluding comments to the draft Government PSpec. A point of contact that can speak for the responding company should be identified to support further Government inquiries as well as explanations that might be needed with regard to the information provided. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for Independent Data Analysis & Solution Development (IDA & SD) for the FAA Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) and the Common Automated Radar Tracking System (CARTS). These systems collect information from radar and other surveillance sources (including multilateration and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Services (ADS-B)), weather sensors, and flight plan information for each aircraft.  Each system integrates the collected data into graphical and textual presentations used by air traffic controllers to safely and efficiently direct aircraft in Terminal Service Areas. These systems are currently operational nationwide at Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities and Air Traffic Control Towers.  The systems undergo evolutionary and complex software development, often including new and improved functionalities including those for alerts and safety.  The FAA has a continuing need for IDA & SD to ensure that system software evolution continues to allow Air Traffic Controllers to decrease possible accident risks, reduce the number of safety-related incidents, and reduce traffic delays while allowing for inclusion of future software enhancements that meet the challenges of growth and change.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>The following adjectival ratings shall be used to evaluate offerors proposals.</p>
<p>Poor Unfavorable<br />Marginal More unfavorable than favorable<br />Good More favorable than unfavorable<br />Excellent Entirely favorable</p>
<p>The following evaluation factors will be evaluated utilizing the adjectival ratings listed above: <br />&bull; Past Performance Information<br />&bull; Specifications (Technical)<br />&bull; Price;</p>
<p>The following evaluation factors will be given a rating of pass or fail:; Green Guard Certification; ISO 9001 Certification; MSDS. Any offeror who receives a fail on any one of those evaluation factors may be ineligible to be included in the competitive range.</p>
<p>&bull; Environmentally Friendly to the environment and the workplace <br />&bull; ISO 9001 Certification<br />&bull; MSDS Sheets <br />Specifications (Technical) and past performance, when combined, are equal compared to price <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<p>Offerors are advised that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions. Therefore, the initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p>Tradeoff Process: It may be in the governments best interest to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technical rated offeror. This process may include tradeoffs among cost/price and non cost factors and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest prices proposal if the perceived benefits of the higher priced proposal are determined to merit the additional cost.</p>

<DESC>The quantity and types of shoreline protection systems that will be selected will be determined through a three-phase competitive ranking process. Phase I shall consist of the submission and evaluation of Technical and Cost Proposals which demonstrate the Offeror's ability to design, fabricate, transport and install a non-rock shoreline protection system. Up to seven (7) Offerors whose Technical and Cost proposals are deemed to represent the most highly ranked viable and economically feasible systems shall progress to Phase II. Phase II shall consist of submission and evaluation of a detailed Site Specific Design of the non-rock shoreline protection system for the locations designated by the NRCS. In Phase III, up to five (5) proposals / systems may be selected and awarded a contract for the actual construction of the non-rock shoreline protection system, contingent upon availability of funds provided by the CWPPRA Task Force.
<p><br />The NRCS is encouraging the submission of technical proposals which present ideas, concepts, and techniques which preclude the use of currently adopted standards. Technical proposals shall contain new technology that has not been fully developed for routine application in coastal Louisiana or in certain regions of the coastal zone. The system length at each of the three sites shall be 500' linear feet (LF) for a total cumulative length of 1500 linear feet for each system selected. <br /><br />TECHNICAL PROPOSALS</p>
<p>The technical proposal shall be clear, concise, and shall include sufficient detail for effective evaluation and for substantiating the validity of stated claims. The proposal should not simply rephrase or restate the Government's requirements, but rather shall provide convincing rationale to address how the Offeror intends to meet these requirements. Offerors shall assume that the Government has no prior knowledge of their facilities and experience and will base its evaluation on the information presented in the Offeror's proposal.</p>
<p>Offerors shall submit a technical proposal which demonstrates the Offeror's ability to design, fabricate, transport and install a non-rock shoreline protection system, including their existing or developed expertise and experience. Page 1 of the technical proposal shall address the pre-selection criteria described below as well as include information identified in the Instructions to Offerors noted in Section L of the solicitation package. Technical proposals shall include shop drawings which include details of all aspects of the proposed system including the dimensions of the system, the anchoring method, installation details for all features, access requirements, and any other pertinent information necessary to convey the details of the system. Technical proposals shall describe how the system will function to reverse, eliminate or reduce shoreline erosion. The technical proposal shall also include details, analysis, assumptions, and other pertinent information to develop and install the system. Technical proposals shall contain sufficient information relative to resources to be used in installation, construction and removal of the proposed system, and whether work will be performed in-house or subcontracted. The technical proposal shall include a clear statement of the objectives and approach to be pursued, background experience and the expected performance of the shoreline protection system. The technical proposal must contain information concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, etc. so that the contractor's understanding of the statement of work may be evaluated. Technical proposals shall also contain sufficient information relative to past performance performing this type of work either in Louisiana or other coastal areas.</p>
<p>INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE NRCS</p>
<p>1. Survey data at each site;<br />2. Geotechnical Report;<br />3. Water level and wave height data at each site</p>
<p>COST PROPOSALS:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.403-1(b) and 15.403-3(a), data other than certified cost or pricing data is required to support price reasonableness. This data shall be provided in accordance with FAR 15.403-5. If, after receipt of proposals, the Contracting Officer (CO) determines there is insufficient information available to determine price reasonableness and none of the exceptions in FAR 15.403-1 apply, the Offeror shall be required to submit certified cost or pricing data. A detailed breakdown of the proposed man-hours, materials and other costs to accomplish the proposed effort shall be included. Significant pricing assumptions, scope limitations, and/or qualifications of the Cost/Price should be summarized. The cost proposal should identify the name of major subcontractors, the type of contract anticipated and an explanation of the subcontract effort. The proposed man-hours and costs by task, all pricing rates used and equipment and materials listings should be specified, if applicable. Subcontractor cost proposals, if applicable, including pricing rate details, shall be provided concurrent with the Offeror's submission.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the Contracting Officer will review this determination and if in the Contracting Officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists, cost information under FAR 15.406-2 will not be required. However, if at any time during this competition the Contracting Officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists, Offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of the price.</p>

<RESPDATE>121511

<DESC>This is Amendment 0001 to Sources Sought Synopsis N44255-12-R-5000, which serves to extend the response submission deadline.

This is a Sources Sought Synopsis. There is no solicitation available at this time. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for Market Research purposes only. No contract or cooperative agreement will be awarded from this announcement.

Naval Facilities Engineering Command Northwest is conducting market research to determine the interests and capabilities of entities that possess potential sites for upcoming compensatory mitigation requirements for impacts to aquatic resources in the Puget Sound area.  This program will establish a list of candidate sites which support compensatory mitigation using permittee responsible mitigation either via preservation of high-value aquatic habitat through a conservation easement for permanent protection of the site or restoration of the site to increase the sites existing function(s) and value(s).
  A combination of preservation, enhancement, and restoration may also be used at the site. Compensatory mitigation may be required for both fresh-water riparian wetlands and nearshore aquatic/marine habitat.  The candidate mitigation sites must be owned in fee simple or have options to purchase by the respondents at the time of the response and must demonstrate the ability to obtain all required entitlement for execution of the restoration within one year.  Additionally, respondents need to have the expertise, experience, or business partnerships in place with organizations who can demonstrate knowledge, expertise, and a proven performance record for long-term monitoring, maintenance, and adaptive management of these mitigation sites to fulfill compensatory mitigation requirements as specified in a Mitigation Action Plan for the site.
  Preference will be given to candidate sites and responses which demonstrate existing habitat value and capacity at the time of response. The current estimate is to provide compensatory mitigation for the loss of 0-10 acres of Nearshore aquatic resources.  The amount of mitigation required will depend on the functions and values of habitat and resources at the candidate sites and the proposed mechanism of mitigation (preservation, enhancement, restoration, etc.). The candidate mitigation site(s) must be able to comply with all requirements of Compensatory Mitigation for Losses of Aquatic Resources; Final Rule (USACE, 2008). Requirements may include compensatory mitigation in the Hood Canal Watershed including work in Kitsap, Jefferson, or Mason County.
 Requirements may also exist in Island and Snohomish Counties.

The proposed permittee responsible mitigation program will be established to improve existing aquatic resources, repair a damaged existing aquatic system or naturalize an area that was once an aquatic system, create a brand new aquatic resource system where one never existed, or protect an existing aquatic resource permanently through an appropriate real estate or other legal instrument.

The proposed program will address watershed needs and how locations and types of compensatory mitigation projects address those needs. The final determination of compensatory mitigation requirement will be based on the attributes of the Navys impacted site, its type, size, function, and regional characteristics, and the type, size, function, and regional characteristics of the selected mitigation sites.
  

Other items for consideration include, but are not limited to: landscape scale, historic and potential aquatic resource conditions, and terrestrial connections between aquatic resources.

Entities interested in participating in this program or having any of the above qualifications should submit a statement of qualifications describing potential sites, capabilities to perform long-term maintenance, adaptive management, and permitting, or experience with wetlands mitigation or restoration projects. Please also include any direct experience in or knowledge of compensatory mitigation vehicles and/or mitigation bank projects. Please ensure the statement of qualifications includes the following:

1.
 Quantity of Habitat (in acres) currently with Real Property Interest, availability to perform conservation on these parcels, and specific details regarding the habitat of these parcels.

2. Quantity of Habitat (in acres) currently with Real Property Interest, availability to perform restoration on these parcels, and specific details regarding the habitat of these parcels.

3. Quantity of Habitat (in acres) with current Real Estate options, availability to perform conservation on these parcels, and specific details regarding the habitat of these parcels.

4. Quantity of Habitat (in acres) with current Real Estate options, availability to perform restoration on these parcels, and specific details regarding the habitat of these parcels.

5.
 Past experience performing long-term maintenance and adaptive management of  restoration sites.

6. Past experience performing long-term maintenance of conservation sites.

The statement of qualifications should not exceed 10 pages. If the entity does not currently have existing restoration or conservation sites, please state when the entity expects to have real property interest in those sites.

Additionally, if a business relationship is required to provide the prospective sites long-term maintenance and adaptive management, submit a statement of when and with whom those relationships will be formalized.  

This announcement is not a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, contract award, or cooperative agreement nor will it reimburse the respondent any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.
 The synopsis does not constitute a request for proposal. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this announcement.

All submittals received will be reviewed for informational purposes. Interested sources must submit their statement of qualifications via e-mail to Ian Robinson, Contract Specialist, NAVFAC NW, e-mail ian.robinson1@navy.mil, phone (360) 396-1865. Responses must be received no later than 2:00PM on 15 December 2011.

<DESC>Modification is being issued to post questions/answers received and extend the response date from 11-18-2011 to 11-25-2011;

1. Is this a request for non-developmental solutions vs. developmental? In other words are you only looking for a fully capable, off the shelf solution?"

Currently, there are no 25MM APFSDS-T cartridges qualified for Navy use. Consequently, the Navy anticipates that test and evaluation (i.e. design verification) would have to be conducted in order to achieve qualification. In order to minimize schedule and budget requirements, the Navy would likely want to minimize any RDT&E efforts for this item.

2. In bullet (1) there is mention to using the Navy's patented projectile design (super-cavitating).
 Does this mean you need us to mention how we would work with the Navy in integrating this projectile into a round?"

Change notice language from "The U.S. Navy holds a patent on a super-cavitating APFSDS projectile design." to " The U.S. Navy holds a patent on a super-cavitating APFSDS projectile design. The Navy may make this information available in conjunction with any future procurement action for this item. Respondents need not describe any method for sharing of intellectual property with the government. Respondents may wish to describe how a super-cavitating capability would be incorporated into their design."

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract with a 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The project objective is to design and construct a school to replace the existing Antilles Elementary School which has reached the end of its useful life.

<DESC>The United States Secret Service (USSS) has been pursuing an initiative named Information Integration and Transformation (IIT) Program which consists of Infrastructure Modernization, Database Architecture/Maintenance and Cyber Security elements.&nbsp; A Request For Information (RFI) and several notices have been posted on this Government site to request information from interested parties and to notify the public of the Government's intent to conduct this acquisition as open market acquisition with public notices posted to this Governmentwide Point of Entry (GPE) known as FedBizOpps.<br /><br />The purpose of this special notice is to inform interested parties that as a result of program improvements over the past two years since release of the RFI, a number of changes in the program structure and strategy have resulted.&nbsp; While modernization plans remain essentially unchanged, the baseline of the current infrastructure has been improved from that described in past FedBizOpps notifications.&nbsp; These improvements resulted from a comprehensive two-year stabilization program that implements the latest versions of database management system software and provides form/fit/function equipment replacement in six technology refresh areas; Servers, Network, Storage, Database, Cyber Security &amp; Back-up.&nbsp; These improvements provide the current stabilized infrastructure which has resulted in reduced risk of catastrophic failure, augmented disaster recovery, and implemented database failover capability.&nbsp; The stabilized infrastructure has significantly improved the performance of the network and associated systems.&nbsp; Additionally, plans for other improvements to the Database Architecture and Maintenance requirements are being finalized.&nbsp; However, the ultimate objective of a modernized hierarchical, converged network with a scalable database architecture that supports mission critical applications and data analysis at the strategic and tactical levels remains to be developed.&nbsp;<br /><br />Further, the Government is currently preparing a solicitation that will be released under GSA's Alliant Government-wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for this acquisition.<a name="_GoBack"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is anticipated that a Solicitation will be issued in the first or second quarter of fiscal year 2012.&nbsp;<br /><br />The USSS is aware that there is considerable interest within industry to assist the USSS in meeting its anticipated needs under this planned acquisition.&nbsp; Interested parties are therefore advised to investigate opportunities available under the Alliant GWAC at their first opportunity.&nbsp; While GSA has stated that "The Alliant contract is no longer open to new prime contractors", GSA has also stated that subcontracting opportunities continue to exist for qualified parties.<br /><br />Interested parties may obtain information about the GSA Alliant contract and how to become a subcontractor to Alliant prime contractors by referring to the following sites:<a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104793"><span style="mso-ansi-language: FR">http://www.gsa.gov/portal/ content/104793</span></a><a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/103908"><span style="mso-ansi-language: FR">http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/103908</span></a>

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, VISN 6, National Contract Authority plans to contract by means for a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition for purchase request 558-12-1-271-0003.  

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  The purpose of this memorandum is to document justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Durham, NC Medical Center (VAMC) for Wheel Chair Van Service. This action will be awarded as a firm- fixed-price sole-source procurement to H2GO, by a purchase order.  

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Durham, NC (VAMC) provides diagnostic and therapeutic services through primary care, acute inpatient care, psychiatric care, chronic spinal cord care, long-term care, hospice palliative care and domiciliary rehabilitative residential care. Wheel Chair Van service is required for patient transportation to various area facilities while providing basic transportation for the beneficiaries of VAMC on an as needed basis, and for patients with regular standing appointments at either VAMC and private facilities in the community.  Estimated value of 30 days of service is $110,000.00 based on current monthly cost.  Period of performance is 10/1/2011 through 10/31/2011.
 
4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	(  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	( X ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): Given the immediate need to provide these services and the stringent requirement regarding Durham VAMC mandated procedures, it is imperative that a contractor experienced with Durham VAMC processes and requirements for patient medical transport provide these services.  H2GO LLC provides these services at the Durham VAMC and has the staffing and vehicles in place, ensuring that services will be seamless to the beneficiary.  H2GO LLC is available to provide immediate service to meet this requirement.  H2GO LLC is the only firm capable of providing the supplies and services described above without the Durham VAMC experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.  This is intended to allow for uninterrupted patient transportation through November 1, 2011. Award for wheelchair Van is currently pending contract start date is scheduled for January 1, 2012. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: Due to the emergent nature of this requirement service cannot be interrupted.  This 30 day purchase order is only intended as a temporary measure to allow for sufficient time for 30-day start-up time for new contract awardees.  This J&A will be posted as required by FAR 6.305(a)

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  H2GO LLC has agreed to provide continued services at the rates outlined in the current contract.  IAW FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(vi)  market research  showed average cost for wheelchair transportation per trip cost range from $56.00- $68.00 within the United States.  H2GO is immediately available and currently performs this function.  Cost associated with reprocurement, contractor cost,  training, administrative cost and burden for a new contractor, during a thirty (30) days of service is unrealistic and will compromise beneficiary access to care for wheel chair van patients. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Market research revealed that a contractor is available to provide the services required, however due to emergent nature of this requirement,  and the necessity to have uninterrupted service H2GO is the only contractors who could provided seamless service.  Contractors must be familiar with Durham VAMC requirements and be able to immediately execute the requirement.   

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  As stated in above paragraph 8 due to the emergent nature of this requirement, and the ability of H2GO LLC, Incorporated  to continue service; it is not in the best interest to the Government to solicit for full and open competition at this time.  Doing so would cause interrupted services to the veterans serviced by this contract.  

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  Through competition of the pending award action.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  Due to the emergent nature of this action there was no time to promote competition.  It is the Government's intention to award a new contract for the Durham VAMC Wheel Chair Van Service.
