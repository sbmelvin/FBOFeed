<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for<br />Electronic System Center's (ESCs)<br />Materiel Solutions for Positive Command and Control (Pos C2) and <br />Integration, Interoperability and Interface (III)<br />Development Planning (DP) Efforts
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI), as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e). The Government is issuing this RFI in an effort to understand market availability, technical characteristics, and functionality of Information Technology (IT) tools, applications or products capable of satisfying the technical, functional, and/or operational capabilities described in this RFI.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposal, request for quotation, or invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to an eventual acquisition approach. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses from this RFI or pay for the preparation of any information submitted or use of such information. All information received from this RFI will be used for planning and market research purposes only.</p>
<p>All information received in response to the RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. <br />BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to gather information on materiel solutions incorporating cost-saving approaches and best practices for accomplishing Positive Command and Control (PC2), and Integration, Interoperability and Interface (III) environment for the 624 Operations Center (OC). The information received as a result of this RFI will be used in the formulation of one or more Concept Characterization Technical Description (CCTD) documents required by the III and PC2 Early Systems Engineering Development Planning (DP) efforts currently being accomplished for Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) in support of the 624 OC. ESC/XR has been tasked with leading the DP support effort and provides the following high-level descriptions of PC2 and III:</p>
<p>The PC2 DP effort is in response to an Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) Commander (CC) request to provide assistance in the development and support of a PC2 capability. In a memorandum to the AFMC/CC dated 18 Dec 2009, the AFSPC/CC stated the need to provide situational awareness that must "allow positive C2 to issue, track, acknowledge, and complete orders." The PC2 capability will allow 624 OC operators to perform C2 functions within the cyber domain.</p>
<p>The III DP effort is in response to an AFMC request to provide assistance in the development and support of an III capability. The overall approach for the effort will be to support the 624 OC, a subordinate of AFSPC's 24th Air Force. In the same memorandum to the AFMC/CC dated 18 Dec 2009, the AFSPC/CC stated the need to provide for situational awareness that must "integrate and interoperate with coalition, joint, other Service components and National Guard and Reserve organizations" and "interface and integrate with Joint Operations Centers, the JSpOC, and AOC systems to collaborate on commander's intent, defended asset lists, and targeting priority." The III capability will allow 624 OC operators to achieve battlespace and situational awareness and to perform C2 functions within the cyber domain.</p>
<p>REQUESTED INFORMATION:</p>
<p>The material solutions must use Open Technology Development (OTD) practices with open interfaces, open standards, and open software. Solutions are to be compatible with a service-oriented architecture (SOA) compliant integration framework. Use of this SOA framework permits third party capability providers to develop and easily integrate future capabilities as mission-centric services for the 624 OC in accordance with the standards and service interface specifications implemented within the SOA framework.</p>
<p>a) The products shall provide a standards-based, SOA compliant, common integration infrastructure to accept, store, aggregate, and display data with a robust User Defined Operational Picture (UDOP) that is flexible and modifiable to maximize operational situational awareness for Cyber C2. <br />b) The products will fully enable rapid integration of data from Cyber sensor feeds, C2 and other applications, as well as Situational Awareness (SA) tools. <br />c) The products should include on&#8208;site integration support for data feeds integration, aggregation, and third party Cyber capability integration.</p>
<p>This RFI includes, but is not limited to, the review of the following trade spaces:</p>
<p>1. Network Mapping<br />2. Visualization<br />3. Task Order Generation and Tracking<br />4. Data Normalization/Translation<br />5. Geospatial/Geo-locational Mapping (GPAS)<br />6. Multi-Interface Chat<br />7. Configuration Management/Oversight<br />8. Infrastructure Elements<br />a. Databases (to include distributed vs. centeral)<br />b. Network Storage iSCSI vs. Fibre Channel<br />c. Operating Systems (Win32 vs. Win64 vs. Linux 32 vs. Linux 64 vs. BSD)</p>
<p>Product capabilities should include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>1. Ability to work in a virtualized environment.<br />2. Collaboration<br />3. Correlation<br />4. Log Management<br />5. Vulnerability Analytics <br />6. Configuration Analytics<br />7. Asset Analytics<br />8. Performance Analytics<br />9. Network Behavioral Anomaly Detection<br />10. End-to-End Data Collection &amp; Correlation<br />11. User Management/Role Based Access Control (RBAC)</p>
<p>Additional data should include but is not limited to:</p>
<p>1. Complete list of ports and protocols used by each system.<br />2. What data format is used by each system?<br />3. What is the content of each data format?<br />4. What is the system's "native" data format?<br />5. What other formats can the system use?<br />6. What is lost in the file conversion?<br />7. Does the file conversion increase or decrease the file size?<br />8. Operating system dependency.<br />9. What is the product's Technology Readiness Level?<br />10. DoD certifications, if any.<br />11. Training requirements.<br />12. Cost<br />a. Licenses<br />b. Support<br />c. Maintenance<br />13. Product roadmap.</p>
<p>In addition to addressing the PC2 and III capability, interested vendors are requested to submit a capabilities statement describing their knowledge of and abilities to perform the following:</p>
<p>Discuss current/recent past experience [within the last five (5) years] in supporting similar efforts in the Department of Defense (DoD) (preferred) or other U.S. Federal Government department/agency (if applicable). Describe any proven experience delivering complicated systems engineering and technical development services within the Federal Government, with emphasis in the telecommunications and network security environments, successful implementation of SOA, and use of collaborative technologies in delivered capabilities.<br />RESPONSES:</p>
<p>Product capability responses to this RFI are requested to be submitted by e-mail to Tim.Greene@hanscom.af.mil and Alan.Hoyt.ctr@hanscom.af.mil not later than 1500 hours EST on&nbsp;30 June 2011. Responses should be single-spaced, Times New Roman, 12 point font, with one inch margins all around, compatible with MS Office Word 2007, with a total page count not to exceed fifteen (15) pages of text with no more than twenty (20) pages of attachments. The response should not exceed a 5 MB mail limit.</p>

<DESC>Sole Source Intent. The Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center-Yuma, U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground (USAYPG), Arizona, intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price contract on a sole source basis with the Arizona Department of Game and Fish, 5000 Carefree Highway, Phoenix AZ 85086. The Arizona Game and Fish Department are the subject matter experts when it comes to researching and monitoring wildlife in the state of Arizona and they have been working on and with USAYPG for nearly 20 years. They are identified in the Sikes Act as being a preferred agency for conducting planning level surveys and other wildlife conservation activities identified in the Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan (INRMP). Pursuant to FAR 6.302-5, the Sikes Act 16 U.S.C. Chapter 5C Conservation Programs on Government Lands, as amended, Public Law 99-561, requires the Secretary of each military department to use trained professionals to manage the wildlife and fishery resources under their jurisdiction and requires Federal and State fish and wildlife agencies be given priority in management of fish and wildlife activities on military reservations. The Sikes Act states "priority shall be given to the entering into of contracts for the procurement of such implementation and enforcement services with Federal and State agencies having responsibility for the conservation or management of fish or wildlife." The Arizona Department of Game and Fish has this responsibility for managing fish and wildlife resources, to include military installations in Arizona. An award to any other source would not be in compliance with the Sikes Act and be detrimental to USAYPG not being able to execute the INRMP as mandated by the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. 670a). THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If you feel that your firm possesses the ability to provide these requirements, then you must respond by demonstrating your firm's technical capability to meet these requirements by 13 June 2011, 10:00 AM MST.

<p>The Department of Education's Policy and Program Studies Service (PPSS) requires technical assistance and support services to Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) grantees of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2011 GEAR UP grant competition. These services will support grantee efforts to access existing sources of longitudinal student-level data and to analyze that data for the purposes of performance reporting and continuous project improvement.</p>
<p>The Department is interested in providing assistance and guidance to GEAR UP grantees as they move from collecting and reporting on data for accountability and compliance purposes to using data to improve practice and promote continuous improvement. Robust longitudinal data systems have been developed by many states and are a major source of information on student performance, enabling use of data to align program services with student needs, to examine student performance over time to measure academic improvement, and to compare student performance with targets. This requires grantees to have new skills and knowledge in understanding, accessing, analyzing, and using data to link data results to improve student performance. This requirement will assist grantees in acquiring new knowledge and skills by issuing a limited number of data utilization awards to grantees to support accessing and analyzing longitudinal student-level data to determine students' performance.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The primary goal of this technical assistance contract is to promote the use of high quality data in the reporting of student outcomes for GEAR UP participants and fostering continuous improvement with the GEAR UP program. In providing technical assistance, the contractor shall focus on assisting grantees in accessing existing sources of high quality data to obtain high quality outcome data on GEAR UP participants and analyzing data to inform grantee practices. To accomplish this, the contractor will perform the following activities:</p>
<p>&bull; Written reviews of the data access and data analysis designs presented in grantees' respective proposals, with recommendations for improvement to the designs.<br />&bull; Regular technical assistance telephone calls with the grantees to monitor the progress of accessing and analyzing data, to identify any challenges encountered, and to make suggestions for addressing these challenges. <br />&bull; Workshops at annual GEAR UP conferences to discuss challenges and issues in accessing and analyzing data.<br />&bull; Annual reports that summarize key elements of the progress of grantees, and discuss challenges encountered and resolutions implemented. <br />&bull; Develop an "On-Line Resource Center" to serve as an information hub, and provide grantees with a range of resource tools to enhance their knowledge and understanding of data usage as well as to assist them in accessing and analyzing data. The On-Line Resource Center will include as a key component an On-line Learning Community.<br />&bull; Conduct periodic site visits to grantees.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be twelve (12) months with two one-year option periods.</p>

<a href="mailto:robert.c.taylor-ii@faa.gov">robert.c.taylor-ii@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for hardware and software maintenance of ISS Proventia Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Appliances in support of the Remote Maintenance System Engineering Team (RMSET).  These appliances are located at the William J. Hughes Technical Center, the National Operations Control Center (NOCC), the Atlantic OCC, and the Pacific OCC.  The FAA is aware that ISS has made the Proventia A-Series IDS appliance "end of life" on April 10, 2011.  However, because the FAA does not plan to upgrade to a new IDS at this time, the Government requires ongoing maintenance of its existing ISS Proventia A1204 appliances.  Therefore, the FAA is conducting this market survey to seek potential sources capable of meeting technical and delivery requirements. Specific requirements are identified in the Schedule of Services attached. Any vendor that believes it can provide these services is invited to submit a Capability Statement (in contractor format) addressing its abilities to meet all of the requirements identified in the Schedule of Services.
This award is anticipated to be a Firm-Fixed Price Contract with a one-year base period and two additional six-month option periods.
At this time the nature of the final competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. The Principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 443120 Computer and Software Stores. 
All responses (one per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 5 typewritten pages. No type font less than 11 point may be used. 
PURPOSE:This market survey is designed to provide information for the FAA to consider in choosing the method and type of procurement competition. The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate SBA 8(a) or other small business participation may result in a determination to conduct this procurement under other competitive procedures.
The FAA requires proof of documentation from interested service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and from eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) 8(a) Program. 
In order to make this determination and to be considered responsive, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:
a. Capability Statement (addressing the ability to meet all the requirements identified in the schedule of services)b. Completed Business Declaration Form (attached)c. Copy of SBA 8(a) Certification Form or proof of documentation from service-disabled veteran-owned small business (if applicable).

<a href="mailto:kimberly.proko@faa.gov">kimberly.proko@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>This public announcement is being issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management System Section 3.2.2.4.
The FAA, William J. Hughes Technical Center intends to issue a Phase III, Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Contract to CHI Systems Inc., of Fort Washington, PA.  The purpose of the SBIR program is to stimulate technological innovation by increasing small business participation in federally funded Research and Development (R&D).
SBIR Phase III contracts can be entered into without competition, in accordance with 20 U.S.C. 2304(b)(2) and 41 U.S.C. 253(b)(2).  The Phase I and Phase II awards made by the United States Air Force satisfy any statutory provisions for competition.
The proposed contract is for a 12 month Base Year and two 6 month options periods.  The FAA is pursuing the use of software agents as Human Behavioral Representations as synthetic simulation pilots and air traffic controllers.  The use of synthetic simulation pilots in high fidelity air traffic control simulation will reduce the cost of Human-In-The-Loop experiments.  The use of synthetic air traffic controllers will enhance the fidelity of sectors adjacent to the sectors under study.  The FAA may also use synthetic air traffic controllers to explore, evaluate and compare various design alternatives in preparation for the Next Generation Air Traffic Control System (NextGen). To minimize risk and cost, the FAA is using software developed under existing SBIR contracts F33615-03-M-6347 (Phase I) and FA8650-04-C-6455 (Phase II).
CHI Systems Inc., is uniquely qualified to perform the work required under the proposed contract on the basis of unique products and specialized expertise currently at hand.  
This is not a request for proposal synopsis nor is the FAA seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA is not liable for costs associated with replies to this announcement. This announcement is prepared for informational purposes only. Inquiries relative to this public announcement are to be submitted in writing to kimberly.proko@faa.gov.

Notice Type:  Notice of Intent to Sole Source


 Based on FAR Part 6.302-2 "Unusual and Compelling Urgency" The Department of Veterans' Affairs VISN 9 Network Contracting Activity (NCA)  will awarded  a sole source procurement to Kinetic Concepts, Inc.(KCI) , located at 3750 Torrey View Court, San Diego, CA 92130-2635, for VAMC, Memphis, Tennessee on June 10, 2011.  

Award of this sole source contract was made to KCI for the continued rental of KCI Wound V.A.C. units currently in use at VAMC Memphis.  The KCI Wound V.A.C systems are utilized in the treatment of various types of wounds from acute applications such as Open Abdomens, Surgical Dehisced Wounds, Traumatic and Grafts to Chronic such as Stage 3 and 4 Pressure ulcers.  This treatment is known as negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT).  

The period of performance, for rental of KCI Wound V.A.C systems, will be from June 14, 2011 to September 30, 2011.  

A solicitation/synopsis will not be issued as this is an urgent need, in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-2.  This is a one hundred and eight day obligation so as not to disrupt patient care prior to a solicitation/synopsis being posted on eBuy for one base year and four option years.  The Veterans' Administration Medical Center, Memphis , Tennessee, is unable to obligate funds from the remainder of Fiscal Year 2011 to the new base year plus four option years contract set to begin in Fiscal Year 2012; therefore, the continued service of Kinetic Concepts, Inc.(KCI) is necessary to finish out Fiscal Year 2011 so as not to disrupt patient care prior to the award of a new contract.

This award is for a limited one hundred and eight day period from June 15, 2011 to September 30, 2011 and will be awarded competitively, through GSA/FAA, for a rental contract of wound vacuums to begin on October 1, 2011.  The competitively awarded contract will be for one base year and four option years, subject to the availability of funds.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is implemented by FAR 6.302-2 (unusual and compelling urgency) as interruption in service to veterans will adversely impact patient care.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.

This is limited source procurement.  The NAICS code for this procurement will be 423450 (Medical Dental Hospital Equipment and Supplies) Size standard 100 personnel.
This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.   Request for information can be sent by email to christina.jackson2@va.gov .

<DESC><p>Introduction<br />The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID's Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement for developing and providing in vitro assays in order to advance the development of therapeutics for infectious diseases.</p>
<p><br />Description <br />NIAID's role in developing medical products to counter emerging, re-emerging and other infectious diseases, as well as agents of bioterrorism, is part of a larger national strategy, involving multiple governmental agencies. As such, NIAID supports integrated efforts in basic and applied research, product development, and technology development based on national priorities for medical products. Since 2001, NIAID has established a comprehensive infrastructure with extensive resources that support all levels of biodefense research. With this solid framework of research and product development resources for biodefense in place, NIAID is now transitioning this infrastructure to provide the flexibility required to meet the challenges of emerging, re-emerging and other infectious diseases in addition to biodefense.</p>
<p>The use of in vitro assays helps advance our understanding of infectious diseases as well as the development of therapeutics and vaccines. Therefore, DMID is committed to developing and providing in vitro assays to benefit the research community and public health.</p>
<p>For the most part, in vitro assay services and other research resources are currently provided through multiple, specialized programs. DMID now seeks to adopt an integrated approach to the provision of services and resources by creating unified, comprehensive, coordinated programs. This strategy is being employed to: advance science by promoting cross-fertilization across and within disciplines and approaches; serve the research community more conveniently; achieve efficient use of resources through economy of scale and avoidance of duplication; and provide the flexibility needed to respond to changing priorities. Accordingly, DMID is establishing the In Vitro Assessments for Antimicrobial Activity program, which will utilize the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract mechanism.</p>
<p>Under IDIQ contracts, base contract awards are made to multiple offerors that successfully propose a general approach to the technical requirements of the solicitation, providing a guaranteed minimum award. Task Orders for specific tasks requiring specialized expertise are competitively solicited and funded within the program Contractor pool. DMID is replacing multiple pathogen or class specific solicitations with one broad IDIQ solicitation for multiple contracts to cover all areas of current and potential future interests.</p>
<p>The work under this acquisition has been broken into five Parts. Work under Parts A, B and D require Biosafety Levels (BSL) 1 through 3, and compliance with Select Agent Regulations through the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and/or the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) (42 CFR Part 73, 7 CFR Part 331, and/or 9 CFR Part 121). For offerors submitting proposals for more than one Part, separate Technical and Business Proposals are required for each Part. Offerors may not submit more than one proposal per Part A, B, C, D or E.</p>
<p>1. Part A - Bacteria and Fungi - Will support the development and use of in vitro assays for routine screening of products against a wide range of bacterial and fungal pathogens, to include all bacteria and fungi on the NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens list (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/CatA.htm) and other bacterial and fungal pathogens that cause disease in humans.</p>
<p>2. Part B - Viruses - Will support the development and use of in vitro assays for routine screening products against a wide range of viral pathogens, to include all viruses on the NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens list, and other viral pathogens that cause disease in humans.</p>
<p>3. Part C - Parasites and Vectors - Will support the development and use of in vitro assays for routine screening of products against a wide range of parasitic pathogens, to include all parasites and vectors on the NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens list, and other parasitic pathogens that cause disease in humans. This Part also includes screening against cell lines from insect and other arthropod vectors.</p>
<p>4. Part D - Toxins - Will support the development and use of in vitro assays for routine screening of products against a wide range of toxins, to include all toxins on the NIAID Category A, B, and C Priority Pathogens list.</p>
<p>5. Part E - Central Data Management System - Will support the development, implementation, operation, and maintenance of a Central Data Management System to support all activities conducted under Parts A, B, C and D.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), Request for Quotation, Invitation for Bid, nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to set-aside any subsequent acquisition based upon known sources and/or responses to this synopsis.<br /><br />
<p>Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems (NGAS) is currently the only known source to possess the capabilities needed to perform the effort described below.</p>
<p>1.0 SUBJECT:</p>
<p>Sources sought for Force Development Evaluation (FDE) System Engineering Support (SES) engineering, analysis and management support for HQ Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC).<br /><br />2.0 DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>HQ AFGSC at Barksdale AFB, LA issues this Sources Sought Synopsis for information and planning purposes in support of the anticipated acquisition of FDE SES work. AFGSC requires support in planning, analyses, trade studies, problem resolution and associated systems engineering in order to meet mission needs as specified in Air Force instructions and Joint/DoD directives. NGAS has developed and maintains approximately 350 software and firmware programs (257 of which are under NG configuration control) crucial to current FDE planning and analysis.</p>
<p>The contractor will provide technical support for new ICBM operational support programs, ICBM operational communication programs, ICBM codes programs, ICBM launch control center programs, ICBM maintenance programs and ICBM mission support through helicopter and security forces operations. The command also requires support in tasks necessary to develop, produce, deploy, operate, secure, test, and evaluate ICBMs.</p>
<p>HQ AFGSC is responsible for conducting the ICBM FDE program for the Minuteman weapon system. The basic objectives of this program are to establish accuracy and reliability planning factors under representative operational test conditions, detect changes in weapon system accuracy and reliability, identify areas for weapon system modification or improvement, and verify operational effectiveness and suitability.</p>
<p>The contractor must demonstrate extensive ICBM weapon system expertise. This expertise is critical in providing the SES. SES tasks include planning, analyses, trade studies, problem resolution and associated systems engineering support tasks necessary to develop, produce, deploy, operate, maintain security, and test and evaluate missile, command control communications, basing, reentry and launch vehicle systems and technology.</p>
<p>Additionally, the contractor must demonstrate the capability to perform systems engineering and analysis including, but not limited to, a working knowledge of ICBM system and subsystem principles and practices, ability to evaluate technical approaches for future MMIII alternatives, provide system and subsystem engineering analysis capability to develop/evaluate system and subsystem requirements, alternatives, and recommend best solutions and support design decisions. Provide support in the development of architectures and evaluation of proposed requirements and specifications for completeness, adequacy and use of a common lexicon across the industrial community. The contractor must also possess the resources to review data and drawings for applicability.</p>
<p>Some specific areas of expertise needed include the ability to provide engineering support to investigate flight test anomalies and provide analyses in determining causes/malfunctions and develop corrective action solutions that mitigate recurrence. The ability to develop, modify, and maintain as needed 6-Degrees of Freedom (DOF) boost to impact simulations and engineering support to range support planning and analysis activities.</p>
<p>The contractor will also need to be able to determine Best Estimate of Trajectory (BET) from deployment to impact for each Reentry Vehicle (RV) and perform Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) hardware analysis using processed Global Positioning System (GPS) data and booster telemetry data to estimate the guidance and control contribution to Multiple Object Track Radar (MOTR). Be able to determine Arming and Fuzing (A&amp;F), Position of Burst (POB), and Height of Burst (HOB), and perform an A&amp;F miss breakout for all A&amp;F instrumented RVs and perform RV separation miss analysis on MK21 JTA4 vehicle.</p>
<p>To accomplish these functions the contractor will, develop, modify, and maintain software to include evaluation of flight mode failures, Instantaneous Impact Points (IIPs), probability of impact, and expected casualties. Maintain regression software to determine guidance error, best estimate of trajectory, miss allocation budget, and A&amp;F accuracy and performance. Develop, modify, and maintain software to support post flight data processing of radar signature data and evaluation of 6-DOF best estimate of trajectory. Current software tools, associated databases, and technical skills used in this work reside only with NGAS.</p>
<p>Develop, modify, and maintain the software tools for engineering estimate activities including error models, trajectory simulations, and propagation algorithms. Develop and maintain software for MM III Accuracy Database including accuracy data, data storage and retrieval, and statistical analysis. Closely identified with the statistical analyses performed, maintain complete databases for Minuteman III and Peacekeeper. The Minuteman III database alone has over 600 attributes. NGAS possesses the Data Management Office (DMO) with over 6000 classified documents and over 4,000 unclassified documents that capture the engineering history of the ICBM program over the past 40 years. This historical information and analyses contribute critically to current work being performed and are the single largest searchable, statistical analysis ICBM database. This database and the configured software tools are the intellectual property of NGAS and access and use require skills and expertise possessed only by NGAS.</p>
<p>Other required support includes ICBM Related Studies, interacting with Air Force offices and other DOD agencies. Contractor shall provide, obtain, manage and apply systems and specialty engineering resources to meet HQ AFGSC requirements for SES for the ICBM weapon systems. Contractor must be able to obtain and maintain a top secret clearance and coordinate on Non-Disclosure Agreements as is necessitated by this contract. The contractor shall support and participate in technical interchange meetings, program status and design reviews, program audits, progress report meetings and other meetings having significant technical content.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information/Comments:
This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only; it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  A contract may not be awarded as a result of this RFI.  
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Organization's seek to acquire information from NAS users and vendors which will help the FAA develop Standards and Requirements for the Airborne Access to SWIM (AATS) concept. The FAA is soliciting information from all commercial sources. Information submitted in response to this RFI will be used to support and enhance the project concept and the project's services. 
The purpose of this Request for Information is to solicit comments from competent commercial sources regarding the FAA's plans to provide aircraft access to the System Wide Information Management (SWIM) system data via Internet Protocol (IP).  The RFI will allow the Federal Aviation Administration to determine what information would be best suited for aircrew use and the capabilities of IP/Satcomm vendors. The FAA has established an Aircraft Access to SWIM (AATS) Workgroup which will review each response received and utilize this information to establish requirements for subject project.
The AATS Program expects this RFI to help provide better understanding of potential solutions and the functional capabilities for AATS in fulfilling FAA's requirements by soliciting input from the airline, commercial, and vendor communities on the FAA's planned approach. Any information provided is strictly voluntary and will be provided at no cost to the Government.

Aircraft AccessTo SWIM Description
The New ATM Requirement Program addresses FAA's goal for capacity and the DOT Reduced Congestion Strategic Objective to "Advance accessible, efficient, inter-modal transportation for the movement of people and goods". It also supports the FAA's National Aviation Research Plan goal for "Fast, Flexible, and Efficient" which supports development of a system that safely and quickly moves anyone and anything, anywhere, anytime on schedules that meet customer needs. Also, this program fits the NextGen goal of expanding capacity by satisfying future growth in demand (up to three times capacity) as well as reducing transit time.
The need for extensive information sharing between collaborating decision-makers has been described in the NAS Concept of Operations. Flexibility in the distribution of roles and responsibilities in planning and Air Traffic Control (ATC) is essential to the achievement of dynamic collaborative decision making. Airborne SWIM integration of various NAS information systems, along with information from NAS users and other information producers, will benefit the NAS by ensuring information interoperability for seamless communications.
It is envisioned that NextGen will require Airborne SWIM-based exchange of flight, aeronautical and weather information between aircraft and ground-based FAA systems. There is currently not an appropriate air-ground data management and exchange mechanism for this information exchange. This program is needed to develop concepts and requirements for an air-ground, Airborne SWIM-based information exchange mechanism compatible with NextGen operational planning.  Airborne SWIM is part of the NextGen portfolio of programs and is critical to ensuring all stakeholders can communicate with each other. For example, Airborne SWIM will allow airline operations, air traffic managers and controllers, Federal Air Marshals, and the military to share information in near real-time. 
Aircraft Access to SWIM benefits include:
Standards and requirements for air-ground communications for non-safety criticalinformation exchange Well-understood concepts of use for air-ground SWIM-based information exchangeBetter weather information to ground-based processing systemsImproved Collaborative ATMImproved management and use of special-use airspace.
The Airborne Access to SWIM project is to be briefed at the Annual FAA National Small Business Procurement Opportunities Training Conference and Trade Show
Description:
The FAA System Operations Offices will conduct the conference session titled "Aircraft Access to SWIM" on Monday, July 18, 2011 12:30pm - 2:00 p.m. at the Annual FAA National Small Business Procurement Opportunities Training Conference and Trade Show. This session will provide a comprehensive overview of the Aircraft Access to SWIM project and concept.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Office of Computer and Communications Systems (OCCS) provides efficient, cost-effective computing and networking services, application development, technical advice, and collaboration in informational sciences to support NLM's research and management programs.</p>
<p>OCCS develops and provides the NLM backbone computer networking facilities, and assists other NLM components with connectivity and local area networking. OCCS provides professional programming services and computational and data processing to meet NLM program needs. OCCS also operates and maintains the NLM Computer Center; develops software; and provides extensive customer support, training courses, and documentation for computer and network users.</p>
<p>OCCS engages to coordinate, integrate, and standardize the vast array of computer services available across the organizations within the NLM, and also provides technological resources for other parts of the NLM and for other Federal organizations with biomedical, statistical, and administrative computing needs.</p>
<p>The Medical Language Branch (MLB) within OCCS is responsible for providing technical support for many of NLM's national and international programs. This application development branch provides: requirements definition services, recommendations for system architectures and implementation strategies, design and develop computer solutions including hardware and software, plans for and implementation of database management solutions, maintenance and enhancements for existing systems, consulting services to NLM offices related to information technology, and evaluations of emerging technologies.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROCUREMENT</p>
<p>The Medical Language Branch of OCCS recently relocated to commercial office space in Bethesda, MD, and requires immediate assistance to supply, install and configure audio-visual gear in a newly renovated conference room. The MLB initially envisioned a conventional room-based video-teleconferencing platform supporting room-to-room audio/video (A/V) to interoperate with similarly configured rooms elsewhere. These requirements have narrowed, and now describe an HD projector/screen and audio-telephony solution. Audiovisual design work has been performed that describes describe these requirements in more detail. The narrower design retains features and engineering to permit the efficient build-out of this A/V provisioning to a broader video-teleconferencing solution that may be needed in the future.</p>
<p>This conference room will be used in high-level presentations and meetings with other developers, customers, and dignitaries. Consequently, this A/V solution must reliably offer clear and noise-free audiovisual access from point to point, and deliver these signals with high fidelity. This A/V solution must offer a low-effort, easy-to-use, user control interface. Switching across different inputs, A/V sources, and functions shall be simple for the untrained user. The system shall be configured to permit responsive and near-seamless presentation of differing sources. The A/V solution shall be well integrated with the current space and furnishings, and, at very least, not detract from the character of this office environment to support leading-edge designers and developers of state-of-the art programming for international medical lexicons.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>Independently, and not as an agent for the government, the contractor shall provide the equipment and qualified and experienced personnel needed to install and configure this equipment to provide an easy-to-use solution for audiovisual control in a conference room for the National Library of Medicine. This work shall include:<br />&bull; Provisioning audiovisual equipment, <br />&bull; Professional installation of this A/V equipment into the conference room and furniture,<br />&bull; Programming/customizing the user control panel interface, <br />&bull; Configuration, testing, and optimization of this installed solution, <br />&bull; Scheduled tune-up/optimization follow-up,<br />&bull; The work may also, at the government's discretion, include the exercise of an optional agreement to provide on-call, as-needed, service support to maintain this solution.<br />The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13.5. The period of performance will be for one year from the date of the award plus four option years. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine. This Sources Sought notice is not a Request for Quotes (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.</p>
<p>Interested firms responding to this sources sought notice must adhere to the following:</p>
<p>(a) Provide a capability statement demonstrating relevant experience, skills and ability to fulfill the Government's requirements for the above. The capability statement should contain enough sufficient detail for the Government to make an informed decision regarding your capabilities, however, the statement should not exceed 10 pages.</p>
<p>(b) The capability statement must identify the responder's small business type and size.</p>
<p>(c) All capability statements must be submitted electronically no later than 3:00pm eastern standard time on Monday, June 20, 2011 to Ryan Singletary ryan.singletary@nih.gov</p>
<p>A draft of the statement of work is attached.</p>

<DESC>****NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) with Marport Stout, Inc. of Snohomish, WA for a TE-150W Compact Trawl Explorer Net Sounder with standard options that include an RPO-0-00 Pitch, Roll DOO-0-0, SS-00-00 Master 144Khz distance Sensor MFX, and an M2REC, Receiver with accessories.<br />**** The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA), Alaska Fisheries Science Center's (AFSC), need for updating current inventory of portable trawl monitoring equipment with newer equipment that still maintains communications compatibility with the old equipment. The AFSC outfits numerous chartered commercial fishing vessels and dedicated NOAA research vessels with standardized trawl monitoring systems for obtaining mission critical data. It is AFSC's goal to eventually replace all of their old stock as funds become available. Continuity in data collection, redundancy in operation and deployment, maintainability, and maximizing opportunities for exchange of gear between vessels are all important aspects of these portable systems. For the purpose of upgrading inventory, they have moved to Marport products which are uniquely compatible with AFSC's current Scanmar inventory of net mensuration equipment. The acoustic communications receiver is required to process the signals from underwater transmitting sensors into distance information to monitor the trawl gear's performance. These sensors must use C-2 or C-5 Boat Code and operate Channels 1-5. The Marport system is the only trawl system that meets all requirements and needs of NOAA /AFSC. Delivery by September 30, 2011.<br />***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the space and service as described that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.

	The case will be made entirely of corrosion proof materials, plastic is desired, which can withstand extended exposure to all climate categories ranging between -25 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit in temperature, at any relative humidity, without detriment to case durability or operability.
 Of particular interest is the cases ability to withstand extreme temperatures, ultraviolet, solvents, impact, and fungus exposure. The case, including operating mechanisms, shall be predominantly 97 percent or more black in color with minimal reflective surface area, less than 1 percent, for tactical purposes. 
	The case shall provide for pressure relief, either automatic or manual, to preclude the case from becoming vacuum locked due to the transition between high-altitude transit and the relative barometric pressure supporting ground operations post-transit.
	The case lid will be hinged in a manner which retains the lid with the case in both open and closed positions, and the lid will be limited to a fully opened angle of more than 90 degrees but less than 110 degrees; this to preclude the lid from being allowed to strike the ground.
 
	The case will provide for the lid to be closed and locked in the closed position through the use external padlock or other external restraining measures. The case lid shall be secured to the lower position of the case by no less than two latches, also made entirely from corrosion-proof materials as stipulated above. The case will have two integrated handle assembly, hinged so that it can lay flat against the exterior surface to minimize footprint in transit. 
	The case size will be determined by the manufacturer design to best fit the gages that are required to fit the inside of the containers; but will not exceed the maximum allowable size to be shipped by private shipment carriers (i.e.
 FedEx or UPS)
	The case interior will be of sufficient size to accommodate the 52 infantry weapon gages, arranged within custom-cut foam insert. The design of the custom cut foam will be determined by the manufacturer to accommodate safe transportation of the weapon gages from being damaged and avoid calibration certification from being voided. The manufacturers will be invited to NSWC, Corona to measure the dimensions of the gages for the needed foam cut out and determine the size of case needed. The foam shall be 2 pound or denser polyethylene closed-cell foam, uniformly gray, charcoal or black in color, which provides organization, protection, and moisture-resistance for said equipment which meets MILSPEC standards.
 

Any sources who can meet ALL of the listed requirements and are interested shall indicate so by adding their company information to the interested vendor list. 
The Government will not award a contract solely on the basis of this Sources Sought Synopsis.

  Band-specific signal capabilities to include band centers from 32.5 to 10,000 Hz.
	2) TRIDENT to include RTA measurement capabilities with microphones for all aspects of experimenter's REAT calibration of S12.6-2008 and experimenter's MIRE and ATF calibration/presentation/measurement for both continuous and impulsive measurement methods of S12.42-2010.  TRIDENT to include all licenses for 1/n measurements, narrowband FFT, loudness in sones per ISO 532, and time waveform.   TRIDENT to accommodate all measurement requirements of S12.6-2008 and S12.42-2010, including signal measurement peak handling, ANSI S1.11 Type 0 filtering, etc., as specified in the Standard.


	3) Turnkey hardware, consisting of wiring, preamplifiers, power amplifiers, equalizers and loudspeakers for a 3-channel signal presentation setup in NSMRL's reverberant room to meet all requirements of ANSI S12.6-2008 (for all aspects of REAT with signal ceiling capabilities for the highest-attenuating double hearing protection and ANR devices) and of ANSI S12.42-2010 (for all aspects of MIRE and ATF testing, not including signals for impulsive measurements).
  Hardware for signal presentation system to interface with REATMaster and TRIDENT systems.  Signal presentation system to accommodate these needs in a Reverberant Room of dimensions:  W 199", L 355", H short wall 120", H high wall 142".  Vendor is responsible for the sound field's calibrated levels, dynamic range, and diffusivity characteristics for the required signals in the S12.6 and S12.42 standards as well as the instrumentation noise floors of the REATMaster and TRIDENT systems. 
	4) On-site setup and calibration of the Systems of 1 and 2 above to meet the REAT and MIRE portions of ANSI S12.6 and S12.42 in NSMRL's reverberant room.  For informational purposes, older reverberation time measurements of the current room show RT60 reverberation times of approximately 2.1 sec at 100 Hz, 2.4 sec at 500 Hz, 2.4 sec at 1500 Hz, and lower reverb times as frequencies increase.
   I mention the RT60's because the S12.6 standard requires RT60 to not exceed 1.6 s for any test band between centers at 125 Hz to 8000 Hz.
	5) Preparation and provision of a document which demonstrates, with all measurement protocols and data there from, the above Systems' compliance with ANSI S12.6-2008 and ANSI S12.42-2010 (excepting impulsive signal presentation in S12.42).    Your document is to include guidance on NSMRL's recommended daily and periodic calibration schedules.
Interested sources are invited to respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis no later than June 27, 2011 at 12:00 pm EST.  The responses should be submitted electronically via e-mail to Rhonda Nielsen, Contracting Officer at Rhonda.nielsen@navy.mil.
  The point of contact for questions regarding this synopsis is Rhonda Nielsen at (860)694-4821.

The goal of these two new acquisitions is to strengthen ARCs abilityto meet the Centers and the Agencys strategic goals for NASA missions by providingcontinuity, flexibility and competiveness. A summary of each acquisition is providedbelow. Both contracts are needed for the full lifecycle of missions. The Fully IntegratedLifecycle Mission Support Services (FILMSS) contract will focus on up-front activities(Phase A) necessary to initiate a project, such as integrated mission planning. In PhasesB, C and& D, FILMSS will be the contract mechanism to provide special studies andanalyses support for programs/projects and technical authorities.   FILMSS becomes theprincipal tool to support programs and projects in Phase E as missions enter theoperations phase. The Project and Engineering Support Services (PESS) contract willprovide multi-disciplinary engineering, testing and fabrication for program and projectefforts. This consolidated engineering support will focus on project implementation,design and fabrication, or work typically performed in phases B, C and D of the programlifecycle and will include spacecraft missions design development and analysis. Together,PESS and FILMSS will provide our programs and projects access to all skills and servicesnecessary to promote a consistent, leveraged, and efficient approach to managing theCenters missions.Fully Integrated Lifecycle Mission Support Services (FILMSS):  The sources sought forthis acquisition has not been posted yet; however, we do anticipate posting the sourcessought in the next month.

The contract is for a period of 90 days pending the award of the successor solicitation SPM7LX08R0179.  The current contract will expire on December 16, 2009 and this contract will incorporate all technical products and service requirements and contract terms and conditions contained within Contract SPM75005D7426 by a contract modification action. The sole source award by contract modification is being issued through other than full and open competition procedures (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B)) and will expire on March 16, 2010.

There is currently a large Army reset program in the works and any delay in the procurement process will impact readiness of the Up Armored HMMWV fleet.  These vehicles are those that are needed in support of SWA.  The current contract with BAE is helping us maintain a readiness rate of 92%.  With the contract currently in place with BAE, they can support these urgent requirements and can supply these items with a delivery of 5-10 days (depending on Priority code) directly to the customer. It is in the Governments best interest to make this sole source award to BAE Survivability Systems.

Contract Number: 	V797P-4443a


Notice Type:  Notice of Intent to Sole Source


 Based on FAR Part 6.302-2 "Unusual and Compelling Urgency" The Department of Veterans' Affairs VISN 9 Network Contracting Activity (NCA)  will awarded  a sole source procurement to Kinetic Concepts, Inc.(KCI) , located at 3750 Torrey View Court, San Diego, CA 92130-2635, for VAMC, Memphis, Tennessee on June 10, 2011.  

Award of this sole source contract was made to KCI for the continued rental of KCI Wound V.A.C. units currently in use at VAMC Memphis.  The KCI Wound V.A.C systems are utilized in the treatment of various types of wounds from acute applications such as Open Abdomens, Surgical Dehisced Wounds, Traumatic and Grafts to Chronic such as Stage 3 and 4 Pressure ulcers.  This treatment is known as negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT).  

The period of performance, for rental of KCI Wound V.A.C systems, will be from June 14, 2011 to September 30, 2011.  

A solicitation/synopsis will not be issued as this is an urgent need, in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-2.  This is a one hundred and eight day obligation so as not to disrupt patient care prior to a solicitation/synopsis being posted on eBuy for one base year and four option years.  The Veterans' Administration Medical Center, Memphis , Tennessee, is unable to obligate funds from the remainder of Fiscal Year 2011 to the new base year plus four option years contract set to begin in Fiscal Year 2012; therefore, the continued service of Kinetic Concepts, Inc.(KCI) is necessary to finish out Fiscal Year 2011 so as not to disrupt patient care prior to the award of a new contract.

This award is for a limited one hundred and eight day period from June 15, 2011 to September 30, 2011 and will be awarded competitively, through GSA/FAA, for a rental contract of wound vacuums to begin on October 1, 2011.  The competitively awarded contract will be for one base year and four option years, subject to the availability of funds.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is implemented by FAR 6.302-2 (unusual and compelling urgency) as interruption in service to veterans will adversely impact patient care.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.

This is limited source procurement.  The NAICS code for this procurement will be 423450 (Medical Dental Hospital Equipment and Supplies) Size standard 100 personnel.
This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.   Request for information can be sent by email to christina.jackson2@va.gov .

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health intends to award a sole source contract to Johnson-York to perform the test and evaluation on the condenser and evaporator shell and tube sheets, pump and motor sets, and cooling towers and electric systems for chiller and cooling tower systems 16 through 21 for repowering units to operate on refrigerant 134a. The National Institutes of Health has a Central Chiller Water Plant that houses twelve (12) five thousand (5000) ton industrial centrifugal chillers (refrigerant R22). The Large chillers provide chilled water to the entire campus at the Bethesda, Maryland location for comfort, process, research, etc. cooling for over 11 million square feet of space. The current nominal capacity in the central utility plant is 60,000 tons. The contract vehicle for this A/E service is a Firm Fixed Price contract for a six month period. The total contract award value will not exceed $1M. NIH anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 to provide this service to meet mission critical requirements for the following reasons:<br /><br />&bull; The testing and evaluation must be performed by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) because they possess the proprietary data such as design and specification documentation, tools, software, etc. to analyze their systems and components that will remain in service for another 25 years to 30 years as well as the new components to match the existing components to remain in service. Johnson-York is the only company that can return (with guarantees and warranties) the chillers and systems to minimum or better OEM standards with R 134a. <br /><br />&bull; Johnson-York has the professional liability of existing OEM documents since they authored them. No other architect or engineer could work to administer the construction of these documents without specific authority granted by Johnson-York and no other architect would be able to totally accept the liability of these Johnson-York documents. <br />Background
<p>The National Institutes of Health has a Central Chilled Water Plant that houses twelve (12) five thousand (5000) ton industrial centrifugal chillers (refrigerant R22 and R134a). The large chillers provide chilled water to the entire campus at the Bethesda, Maryland location for loads for cooling comfort, processes, research, etc. for over 11 million square feet of space. The current nominal capacity in the central utility plant is 60,000 tons. Like others in the industry, NIH maintains a chiller capacity arrangement of N+1, &lsquo;N' is equal to the firm capacity and the &lsquo;1' is the standby or backup capacity (the largest unit). Specific to NIH, N is 5000 tons (times 11) and 1 is 5000 tons; therefore, the firm capacity is 55,000 tons with 5000 tons as backup. The current load or demand in 2009 and 2010 for several days during the summer months have warrant operating eleven chillers (53,000 to 54,000 tons). As stated in various utility studies and Utility Master Plans, six of the twelve chillers are old and are approaching their useful life as well as inefficient with respect to energy and sustainability policies, regulations, and laws..</p>
<p>Purpose and Objective</p>
<p>The purpose of this scope of work (S.O.W.) is to evaluate and report on the condenser and evaporator shell and tube sheets, pump and motor sets, and cooling towers and electric systems for chiller and cooling tower systems 16 through 21 for repowering units to operate on refrigerant 134a.</p>
<p>The evaluation will determine the possibility of salvaging the evaporator and condenser shell and tube units (heat exchangers), with necessary modifications, while replacing the compressor driveline, the evaporator and condenser pump and motor systems, and possibly the intercooler, cooling towers and controls for a more efficient operation without loss of cooling capacity.</p>
<p>This comprehensive assessment shall include but not be limited to all associated components of the chiller system(s) mentioned above including the chilled water piping back to the common header for integrity and size, and the entire condenser water piping system to and from the towers including the common header. The assessment shall also include the structural support of the evaporator and condenser, the isolation pad layout, proposed components for the new chiller system, and system modeling to predict performance and capacity for chillers using 134a refrigerant.</p>
<p><br />This notice of intent is not request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This procurement is not set-aside for small business.

<p><strong>Description of Requirement:</strong></p>
<p>EPA Region 1 in Boston, Massachusetts requires the use of the LifeLine Wireless Monitoring system produced by Safe Environment Engineering which enables IP-based communication between emergency response equipment field sensors and a command station which can be located near a field, or anywhere accessible via the internet. LifeLine supports a wide range of field sensors including all of the field sensors cited for managing personnel safety protocols within the emergency response community of EPA.</p>
<p>All sensor data managed with LifeLine Wireless Monitoring System is geo-referenced and communicated in the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) standard format which is recommended by DHS to enhance interoperability among agencies collecting environmental data.</p>
<p>The LifeLine Wireless Monitoring components are integral components of the VIPER Sensor Communication System developed by USEPA-ERT. This system is designed to support the use of field sensors in a wide range of mobile and fixed field applications ranging from emergency response to long term site control monitoring. The use of VIPER enables EPA to integrate and communicate sensor data without dependence on vendor-specific proprietary data communication systems.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 5.201(b)(1)(ii), this is a notice of the West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center's intent to exercise its option to extend the service on contract VA248-P-1376 for eyeglass dispensary services at the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center from July 1, 2011 through September 30, 2011. This contract is with Superior Optical, Inc. This action is authorized by contract clause FAR 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services to allow for sufficient time to undertake and complete a new procurement for these services which is currently underway. This option was previously exercised for a period of 3 months from April 1, 2011 to June 30, 2011. This current action is necessary because of the lack of adequate transition time due to administrative delays and consideration of additional procurement costs. The anticipated release date for the solicitation for the services under the new procurement is July 15, 2011 and this solicitation will be posted through the FBO website. Responses are not being solicited to this notice.

<p><br />4. National Plant Germplasm Quarantine Center <br />Temporary Rental Chiller Vendor Requirements</p>
<p>The National Plant Germplasm Quarantine Center (NPGQC) in Beltsville, Maryland, is a mission critical APHIS facility that operates 24/7. Two aged 150-ton McQuay air-cooled rotary screw chillers attempt to supply 42 degree chilled water year-round throughout the complex. The chilled water is utilized in providing critical temperature controlled environmental conditions for the BSL-3AG High Containment Facility, growth chambers, growth rooms, and diagnostic laboratories. Continual operation of the two McQuay chillers is critical for conducting plant pathogen testing and guaranteeing containment of foreign pathogens at NPGQC.<br />The two chillers are not capable of providing adequate cooling to the laboratories and facilities on hot humid days in the summer. NPGQC has experienced constant breakdowns of the chillers since they were installed. APHIS Engineering is currently designing the addition of a third chiller along with an upgrade chilled water distribution system. The design and installation will not be completed until late fall at the earliest. A temporary 300+ ton capacity chiller will need to be rented and installed immediately at NPGQC this spring in order to guarantee the 24/7 supply of 42 degree F. water until the current chilled water system can be upgraded. The temporary rental chiller requirements include: <br /><br />4.1 Contractor shall provide: Portable rental air cooled chiller, 300 ton Minimum required capacity with 30% ethylene glycol. Chiller shall include an Integral chilled water pump package consisting of bypass, strainer and triple duty valve.<br />4.2 Rental period shall be for a minimum of three months with option for additional monthly rental extensions. Initial costs include delivery and labor for installation and setup.<br />4.3 Contractor shall provide temporary piping from rental chiller into flanged piping connections existing after removal of spare chilled water pump.<br />4.4 Rental chiller shall have the ability to deliver 42 degree chilled water with 52 degree return temp.<br />4.5 Contractor shall adjust and balance the temporary chiller installation systems to maintain existing flow conditions varying from approximately 400 to 772 Gallons per minute. <br />4.6 Chiller should have multiple compressors and refrigerant circuits to unload down to minimum loads of approximately 75 tons.<br />4.7 Chiller needs to have the ability to "auto reset" after power fluctuations, bumps, or outages.<br />4.8 Contractor shall provide temporary electrical supply and all associated breakers disconnects and wiring from main building electrical panel to chiller. <br />4.9 Contractor shall provide written and oral instruction on resetting chiller in the event of a failure.<br />4.10 Contractor shall provide all temporary chilled water fittings, piping and ethylene glycol solution in order to connect temporary chiller. <br />4.11 At the end of the rental period contractor shall be responsible for removal of and disposal of Ethylene Glycol before deconstructing the temporary piping.<br />4.12 Contractor shall be responsible for providing plywood sheets or other support under trailer wheels and landing gear to prevent trailer from settling into grass.</p>

Authorized Workers Notice to Potential Bureau of Reclamation Contractors(a)	Definitions.  		IRCA - Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986		INA - Immigration and Nationality Act		INS - Immigration and Naturalization Service 		SSA - Social Security Administration		INS SAVE Program - The INS Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements Program		ESA - Employment Standards Administration (Department of Labor)
(a) Authority.  Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (8 USC 1101 as amended) and the Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 274A.
 	(b) Who is Covered.  INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment verification, and nondiscrimination.  These provisions apply to all employers, including government contractors.
 	(c) Basic Provisions/Requirements.   Under IRCA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the U.S., i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S. and aliens authorized to work in the U.S.  The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired, which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Verification Form (I-9).  Employers must keep each I-9 on file for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer.  Detailed guidance on the I-9 is available at the INS web site:http://www.ins.gov/graphics/services/employerinfo/index.htm .
	(d) Employment Verification Pilot Programs.  The INS and the SSA are conducting the following programs that provide employers a way to confirm the employment eligibility of their newly hired employees.  Any employer located in a pilot state may volunteer to participate in a pilot program.  If employers are not located in a pilot state, they would verify employment eligibility by following the procedures currently in place, i.e., by completing Form I-9.
(1) The Basic Pilot is a joint pilot being conducted by the INS and SSA in the States of California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New York, and Texas. This pilot involves verification checks of the SSA and INS databases of all newly hired employees, regardless of citizenship. To receive information on the Basic Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981, or write to USINS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO Building 4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536. You may also contact the Social Security Administration by calling (410) 966-1940, or writing to Social Security Administration, Office of Program Benefits Policy, 6401 Security Blvd., 760 Altmeyer, Baltimore, MD 21235.
(2) The INS is conducting the Citizen Attestation Pilot in the States of Arizona, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Virginia.  The Citizen Attestation Pilot permits participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly hired alien employees by using a personal computer with a modem.  To receive information on the Citizen Attestation Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981.  Employers may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
(3) The INS and the SSA are conducting the Machine-Readable Document Pilot in the State of Iowa. The Machine-Readable Document Pilot is identical to the Basic Pilot in all respects, except for the geographic scope of the pilot and for one additional feature.  If an employee presents an Iowa's driver's license or identification card containing a machine-readable SSN, the employer will make an inquiry through the confirmation system by using the machine-readable feature.  To receive information on the Machine-Readable Document Pilot program please call the INS SAVE Program toll free at 1-888-464-4218, or fax your request for information to (202) 514-9981. You may also write to US/INS, SAVE Program, 425 I Street, NW, ULLICO-4th Floor, Washington, DC 20536.
 	(e) Employee Rights.  The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.
 	(f) Compliance Assistance.  More detailed information, including copies of explanatory brochures and regulatory and interpretative materials, may be obtained from local offices of the Department of Labor's Employment Standards Division, Wage and Hour Division, and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.
 	(g) Penalties/Sanctions.  Employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The INS enforces the INA requirements on verification of employment eligibility. The Justice Department enforces the anti-discrimination provisions.  As part of their ongoing enforcement efforts, the ESA's Wage and Hour Division and Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conduct inspections of the I-9 forms.  They report their findings to the INS and to the Department of Justice when they find cases of disparate treatment or unauthorized employment.  A debarring official may debar a contractor, based on a determination by the Attorney General of the United States, or designee, that the contractor is not in compliance with the INA. The Attorney General's determination is not reviewable in the debarment proceedings.

Other hotels in the metro Atlanta area were considered as a host site for guest sleeping rooms for the EIS Summer Course. Such hotels include: Residence Inn - Lenox Park and Courtyard by Marriott - Executive Park. Some hotels were located within a 5 mile radius and others were not.
<p>The Atlanta Marriott Century Center hotel has agreed to provide complimentary<br />shuttle service to surrounding CDC facilities. The hotel has the capacity to provide onsite meeting space for 200 people.The hotel has also agreed to provide the microwave and refrigerator combo in each guest room, complimentary High Speed Internet and Local and Long Distance Phone Calls within the US in each guest room and the hospitality suite.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Irrigation Fluids. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project. <br /></strong>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) areas of responsibility (AOR) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. This Standardization Action (SA) will apply to all MMESOs. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance requirements as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical the clinical preferred threshold, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor (s) for this SA support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br />The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, National Naval Medical Center, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brook Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital; MMESO West: Naval Medical Center San Diego, Madigan Army Medical Center, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, the 48th Medical Group, Lakenheath, UK; and Operational U.S. Forces.<br />This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESOs Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<br />This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is August 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. Points of Contact: Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3270; Mr. Jim Quinn, Clinical Analyst, james.e.quinn@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3295.</strong><br />B. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs, are seeking product line items in the category of Irrigation Fluids. Within the MMESOs, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $2,792,436.22. This forecast is based on historical Prime Vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data 20 line items of the total 63 line items, account for 91.93% ($2,567,222.86) of the total volume in sales ($2,792,436.22) in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below, consolidated by product type to reduce duplication within the top 20 lines. This represents the line item, or SKU, reduction that is an additional objective of this program.<br />C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>A vendor interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Kevin Hill, MMESO South, Team Leader, Kevin.w.hill@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3270; Mr. Jim Quinn, Clinical Analyst, james.e.quinn@amedd.army.mil, 210-292-3295.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO South that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO South via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong>A vendor who does not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</strong> <br />D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO South reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br />Phase I Technical / Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. A vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.<br />Technical/Company Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the technical/company requirements outlined below. The six (6) requirements below must be answered and all supporting documentation provided with the vendor's initial submittal by the response date stated in the FBO announcement. A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br />1. Vendor MUST provide a line of Irrigation Fluids products that includes at a minimum the specific products and sizes identified below for Irrigation Fluids within the categories of Latex Free, 0.9% Sodium Chloride Irrigation, USP; Sterile Water for Irrigation, USP and Lactated Ringers Irrigation, USP. <br />a.

Vendors MUST provide Irrigation Fluids products that are approved for use by the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA). The Irrigation Fluids products shall comply with the National Patient Safety Goals (NPSG), and the Center for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC), Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration (OSHA) Standards, and provide literature to support this requirement with the initial submittals. American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM); ASTM F2172-02: Standard Specification for Blood/Intravenous Fluid/Irrigation Fluid Warmers, 1.1 Scope Addition: This Standard Specification specifies requirements for FLUID WARMERS as defined in 2.2.101. 1.2 Object Addition: The object of this Standard Specification is to establish requirements for FLUID WARMERS which minimize hazards to PATIENT and OPERATOR and to specify tests by which compliance can be verified. <br />3. Vendor must provide guidelines for solution warming parameters with initial submittal. At a minimum these guidelines must include recommended storage temperature, recommended maximum warming temperature along with length of time warmed fluids will maintain their integrity.<br />4. Vendor MUST have a DAPA or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA for the Irrigation Fluids product line. Vendor MUST provide the DAPA number with initial submittal or provide documentation that DAPA has been applied for with response submittal. Vendors without a DAPA number or those that have not applied for a DAPA will be disqualified in Phase I. <br />5. Vendor MUST have agreements with the current Med/Surg prime vendors for each MMESO AOR, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Irrigation Fluids or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements. Vendor must provide documentation to support agreements with initial submittal. Vendors whose products are not available through the Prime Vendors or who have not applied for PV distribution will be disqualified in Phase I. <br />6. Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for the products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA in Phase III for ALL products will be disqualified.).<br />Phase II Acceptability Evaluation Clinical Performance<br />Clinical Performance Requirements <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO South, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the CPT members at the participating MTFs. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. <strong>Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process. Vendor must send the MMESO South verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor. <br /></strong>Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. (Unused samples will not be returned). One case or 12 of each type and size of Irrigation Fluids listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation. <br />Item to Send Number Each to send per MTF Size<br />Solution Irrigation Sodium Chloride 0.9% 1000ml Bottle 1 case (or 12 bottles each) 1000ml<br />Solution Irrigation Sodium Chloride 0.9% 3000ml Bag 1 case (or 12 bags each) 3000ml<br />Solution Irrigation Sterile Water 1000ml Bottle 1 case (or 12 bottles each) 1000ml<br />The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for 14 calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be conducted using the below listed requirements with responses as either a "YES" (meets/passes requirements) or "NO" (does not/fails to meet requirements) answers. The MMESO JPRB has established that the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization will be eighty percent (80%) of the requirements questions answered as "YES" (meets/passes requirements). A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative.<br />A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Of those vendors who are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO South, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review. Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line.<br />There will be approximately eight MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products. <br />Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the MMESO CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. (NPSG.03.04.01: Label all medications, medication containers, and other solutions on and off the sterile field in perioperative and other procedural settings. UP.01.01.01: Conduct a pre-procedure verification process). The container labeling must be easy to read and includes type of fluid, volume gradient and expiration date. The container must be clearly labeled to assist in avoiding serious errors and harm to the patient by adhering to the "Five Rights" (Right Patient, Right Medication, Right Dose, Right Time, and Right Route).<br />2. (NPSG 03.04.01 &amp; 07.05.01) Implement evidence-based practices for preventing surgical site infections). The fluid container must be optically clear, making it easy to determine the condition of the fluid. The product must be free of any sediment, particle threads, and opaque quality of the fluid, or foreign materials that could be acutely and potentially deadly to a patient.<br />3. (NPSG.07.05.01: Implement evidence-based practices for preventing surgical site infections) The package must be easy to open and allows for aseptic delivery to the sterile field. The container must be easy to open to prevent contamination of the sterile field which would prolong the surgical procedure and could increase the potential for patient harm.<br />Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Price Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO South and must be received by 5:00 PM CST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong>

Vendors must provide a dual role combat arms earplug that features 1) a nonlinear acoustical design with a calibrated filter within its stem allowing most low level sounds to be heard virtually unaffected during wear (allows for better communication allowing speech through) and 2) a second feature allowing the choice for steady protection with an NRR of 22 to24 dB; which is the ideal wearing position when exposed to constant high-level sound sources (85 dB and above) such as aircraft, watercraft, armored vehicles or machinery. In this mode, the plug provides excellent protection against noise, but it will block speech and other ambient sounds as well.<br />5. Vendor must provide ear plugs that allow an increase in attenuation as noise increases.<br />6. Vendor must provide dual role ear plugs that incorporate breathable, moisture resistant acoustical filters that improve sound quality when the ear is overloaded with excess noise.<br />7. Vendor must provide ear plugs that provide a reliable fit that contours to the shape of the ear, allowing the user to wear these earplugs for extended periods of time without discomfort, irritation or constant removal from the ear for re-insertion. <br />8. Vendor must provide a statement confirming their Ear Plugs-Combat product line comes in a labeled package demonstrating the size and style of the contents and lot numbers.<br />9. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Ear Plugs-Combat. Vendor must provide the DAPA number with initial submittal or provide documentation the DAPA number has been applied for with response submittal. <br />10. Vendor must have agreements with the current Med/Surg Prime Vendors for each MMESO AOR, i.e. Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor for Ear Plugs-Combat or be in the process of obtaining Prime Vendor agreements.<br />11. Vendor must submit discounts off of DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. A vendor who fails to submit a discount off of DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price. A vendor shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative. A vendor who does not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in Phase II will be disqualified. <br /><br />Phase II Acceptability Evaluation Clinical Performance<br />Clinical Performance Acceptability Requirements <br />Following acceptability of the technical/company requirements, the MMESO Europe, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to the specific CPT members at the participating MTFs as directed. Vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the issue of the notice in which to deliver the product samples for clinical evaluation at Phase II. <strong>Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the designated addresses by 5:00PM local time for each MTF on the 30th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendor MUST be able to deliver product literature, training materials and evaluation samples to the MMESO Pacific via FedEx or UPS AND to the MMESO Europe via United States Postal Service (USPS) and throughout the United States when requested in Phase II. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendor who cannot or does not meet this requirement will be disqualified from the standardization process.</span> Vendor must send the MMESO Europe verification regarding the shipment of literature and samples. This information will include the date of shipment, final delivery date, tracking numbers and the carrier used by the vendor.</strong> Vendor will provide ONLY the following no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation. Unused samples will not be returned. Five (5) pairs of each size and style listed below are to be provided to each of the evaluation sites as identified in the letters of invitation.<br />1. Single-sided combat ear plug, ear plug must be within the range of an NRR 21 to 24dB, in sizes small, medium, and large, 5 pairs of each size per MTF, or a universal size, and only 5 pairs per MTF test site<br />2. Dual role* combat ear plug, ear plug must be within the range of an NRR 22 to 24dB, in sizes small, medium, and large, 5 pairs of each size per MTF, or if a universal size, and only 5 pairs per MTF test site<br />*Dual role, see technical requirement #7 above</p>
<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)-Completely Unacceptable, two (2)-Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3)-Partially Unacceptable, four (4)-Acceptable, and five (5)-Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization. A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Europe, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review. Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line.<br />There will be approximately nine (9) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. Patient Safety/Compliance/DoD Hearing Loss Prevention /OSHA 1910.95 Occupational Noise Exposure - The ear plug is comfortable (soft, flexible flanges) and allows easy insertion into the ear canal. The ear plug must be easy to insert and allow for user comfort to ensure the user will wear the device continually providing the desired result of noise induced hearing protection. <br /><br />2. Patient Safety/DoD Hearing Loss Prevention /OSHA 1910.95 Occupational Noise Exposure - After insertion the earplug provides a good seal. The product must provide noise induced hearing protection for noise greater than 84 dB and peaks of 140 dB. A good seal should be accomplished by a vacuum sensation (a back pressure) and voice should sound muffled.</p>
<p>Price Analysis Process:<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. <strong>Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Europe and must be received by 5:00 PM CET, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors' offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ear Plugs-Basic. </span>The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the MMESO North, South, West, Pacific, Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. It is intended for this initiative to result in the standardization of a technically and clinically preferred product (s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the best possible price. It is intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor (s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single award for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs include, but are not limited to MMESO North Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Bethesda Naval Hospital, Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South Wilford Hall Medical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; MMESO West Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath, and Operational U.S. Forces. This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Region, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA TS Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor (s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to advance and participate Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is September 2011.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <strong>Points of Contact: Mr. Robert Halliday, Clinical Analyst, Robert.halliday@us.army.mil 011-49-6221-172109 and Mr. Tom Winkel, Data Analyst, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil 011-49-6221-172106.</strong></p>
<p>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Ear Plugs-Basic. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $1,006,736.69. This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period. Based on the recent 12-month usage data, one hundred eleven (111) of the total one hundred eighty one (181) line items represent the top two (2) products and account for 65.03% ($654,751.53) of the total volume in sales $1,006,736.69 in the MMESOs and are procurement significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mr. Rob Halliday, Clinical Analyst, at robert.halliday@us.army.mil and Mr. Tom Winkel, Data Analyst, Tom.winkel@us.army.mil. The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Europe that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the MMESO Europe via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM Central European Time (CET) (GMT +1 hour) local time on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFIAQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.</span></strong></p>
<p>D. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO Europe reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary. <br /><br />Phase I Technical/Company Requirements<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements and determine acceptability. A vendor must meet the technical requirements for continued consideration in this initiative. A vendor who does not meet the requirements will be disqualified. Failure to provide any requested information or meet any of the technical requirements will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. A vendor who meets the following technical/company requirements will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance selection process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication. All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate or notices of disqualification) should be digitally signed.</p>
<p>Technical/Company Requirements: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the company/technical requirements outlined below. The nine (9) requirements below must be answered with the vendor's initial submittal and required documents by the response date stated in the FBO announcement will be disqualified in Phase I. <strong>A vendor who does not meet these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements with initial submittal will be disqualified in Phase I.<br /><br /></strong>1.

<p>The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for fourteen (14) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1)-Completely Unacceptable, two (2)-Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3)-Partially Unacceptable, four (4)-Acceptable, and five (5)-Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization. A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical /performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Europe, and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review. Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating all sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. Each evaluator will evaluate or trial each participating vendor's product line. <br />There will be approximately nine (9) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements: During the acquisition planning process, the CPT validated/approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. <br />1. Patient Safety/Compliance/DoD Hearing Loss Prevention /OSHA 1910.95 Occupational Noise Exposure - The ear plug is comfortable (soft, flexible flanges) and allows easy insertion into the ear canal. The ear plug must be easy to insert and allow for user comfort to ensure the user will wear the device continually providing the desired result of noise induced hearing protection. <br />2. Patient Safety/DoD Hearing Loss Prevention /OSHA 1910.95 Occupational Noise Exposure - After insertion the earplug provides a good seal. The product must provide noise induced hearing protection for noise greater than 84 dB and peaks of 140 dB. A good seal should be accomplished by a vacuum sensation (a back pressure) and voice should sound muffled.</p>
<p>Price Analysis Process:<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified /invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. <strong>A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit IA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Europe and must be received by 5:00 PM (CET)(GMT +1 hour) local time, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes.</strong> Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor. Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendors' offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong>Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</strong></p>

<p>This solicitation is open to all vendors under NAICS Code 611430 (Professional and Management Development Training)<br /><br />1. Quote shall be based upon the attached Statement of Work (SOW).<br /><br />2. Quotes will be evaluated based on best value with the evaluation criteria listed below.<br /><br />3. All quotes shall include not only the total cost, but all costs associated with the requirement.</p>
<p>EVALUATION 52.212-2 EVALUATION -COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br />The contract awarded as a result of this Request for Proposal (RFP) will be an integrated assessment of the results of the evaluation based on the evaluation factors and their relative order of importance, as indicated below. Award shall be made to the Offeror whose RFP is determined to best meet the needs of the Government after consideration of all factors. The two (2) technical factors - Technical Acceptability and Past Performance when combined are more important than Cost (non-technical factor). "Best value," for the purpose of this RFP, is defined as the procurement process that results in the most advantageous acquisition decision for the Government and is performed through an integrated assessment and trade-off analysis between the non-cost/price factors and cost/price factors. Ultimately, the source selection decision will take into account the contractor's capability to meet the requirements of this solicitation on a timely and cost-effective basis. Accordingly, the Government may award any resulting contract to other than the lowest priced Offeror, or other than the Offeror with the highest technical rating.<br /><br />FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY<br />Technical acceptability is the most important factor for the acquisition and will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of the extent to which the contractor's solution will achieve the stated objectives as outlined in the SOW. The evaluation will include an assessment of whether the contractor's solution: <br />Demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive understanding of the development and delivery of a customized training course outlined in the SOW.<br /><br />FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCE <br />The Offeror will be evaluated on the Offeror's proven ability to meet technical acceptability for similar efforts in the recent past. The Offeror should provide a narrative of experience for similar courses or workshops. The narrative should address when the workshops or courses were taught and the approximate number of students.<br /><br />NON-TECHNICAL FACTOR<br />Cost (Non-technical Factor): The Offeror is to demonstrate the ability to provide a sound competitive offer associated with the services identified within the solicitation. The government will evaluate the Offeror's cost for fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>Cost, while being an important factor, it is not in and of itself the determining factor in the selection of the successful Offeror for award of the contract by this solicitation. Cost is not scored or weighted; rather, each Offeror's cost will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness.<br /><br />FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.<br /><br />FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders -Commercial Items, apples to this acquisition.<br /><br />CONTRACTOR'S QUESTIONS<br />All questions pertaining to this solicitation shall be submitted electronically only to Jeremy Weatherman at Jeremy.Weatherman@wdc.usda.gov. The deadline for receipt of questions or clarifications is June 17, 2011 at 3:00 p.m., EDT. Phone calls will not be accepted for questions pertaining to this solicitation. Amendments shall be issued for all responses to questions and if any part of the RFP is modified as a result of questions received.</p>

<CONTACT>Amy Sheib, Phone 3014966546, Email ap370t@nih.gov
<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement. This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect in the March 2005 FAR Revision, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis. It is the intent of the Center for Information Technology (CIT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), to negotiate on a sole source basis with Schrodinger LLC, 101 SW Main Street, Suite 1300, Portland, Oregon 97204, to renew NIH-wide licenses for a group of Schrodinger proprietary molecular modeling software products and support. CIT has acquired annual licenses to Schrodinger molecular modeling software products on a sole-source basis since 2000 which currently consist of interchangeable tokens (i.e., "floating licenses") that allow NIH researchers to concurrently run the various Schrodinger molecular modeling software products as required. Renewal of the Schrodinger software licenses are required by the Center for Molecular Modeling (CMM), Division of Computational Bioscience, CIT. CMM is a major supplier of molecular resources and expertise to the NIH research community, organizes molecular modeling users at the NIH by sponsoring the NIH inter-institute Molecular Modeling Interest Group, and created a distributed molecular modeling environment that is accessible from UNIX workstations and personal computers maintained by individual NIH investigators. CMM's computational chemists collaborate with NIH researchers on molecular modeling-related projects by providing expertise on scientific interests that include modeling of macromolecular structure and dynamics, structure-function relationships of macromolecules, macromolecular interactions, and ligand binding. In order to continue providing expert support to the NIH research community, CMM requires the continued use of commercially available molecular modeling software products for the 12-month period of 08-01-11 through 07-31-12 that provide all of the following functionalities: (1) a powerful and innovative software application for accurate protein structure predictions; (2) a fully-integrated protein structure program that provides an easy-to-use interface that takes a novice user intuitively from sequence to alignment to refined structure; (3) the ability to provide the expert user complete control over calculational settings to maximize accuracy of predictions; (4) a powerful and complete tool for generating accurate receptor models for structure-based drug design; (5) the ability to combine leading force fields, accurate effective solvation models, and advanced conformational searching methods that provide the most complete molecular modeling package suitable for a wide array of research; (6) a complete solution for ligand-receptor docking which provides the full spectrum of speed and accuracy from high-throughput virtual screening of millions of compounds to extremely accurate binding mode predictions with consistently high enrichment at every level; and (7) the ability of the software products to work with each other to simulate receptor flexibility in response to ligand-binding events. After consulting with NIH researchers, particularly from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), CIT has determined that the Schrodinger software products are the only commercially available ones that can provide the required combination of comprehensive molecular modeling functionalities described above that are required by NIH researchers. This notice of intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsible and responsive sources may submit descriptive literature fully documenting their molecular modeling software applications and support which will be considered by the agency. Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide software and support that can fulfill all of the requirements specified above. Information received in a timely manner will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government to conduct a competition for this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This requirement is being processed for CIT by the National Library of Medicine (NLM). NLM intends to make an award for these commercial items in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web site http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/SAP/sap.htm: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors; 52.212-3, Offeror's Representations and Certifications; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions, and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes. The contractor shall comply with all other applicable Federal, state, and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations in effect at time of award. Full text of FAR clauses and provisions are available at: http://www.arnet.gov/far/index.html. Responses must be received by the NLM Point of Contact within seventeen (17) calendar days from the publication date of this notice. NLM Synopsis No. NLM-11-103-AS shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement. RESPONSES SHALL BE SENT VIA EMAIL TO: Amy Sheib, Contract Specialist at ap370t@nih.gov.

<p>CAR 1352.271-71 METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer ;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.<br />(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.<br />(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>FAR clause 52.212-2, EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) ADDENDUM:&nbsp; Paragraph (c) is hereby deleted.&nbsp;<br /><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:&nbsp; Technical approach and Past PErformance.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Technical approach and past performance are more important than price.</strong> <br /><br />(b) "Options." The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(End of Provision)</p>

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) in Orlando, Florida intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, a contract to buy Line Driver Circuit Cards (LDCCs) and Technical Data Package (TDP) for the Type-18 periscope of the Submarine Tactical Visual Training System (STVTS) using FAR Part 13 SAP.  The LDCCs will provide the interface between the STVTS periscope barrel and the systems host computer.  The TDP will provide a technical description to allow fabrication of the LDCCs.  Currently, there are no working spares for these cards and if a card currently in the system were to go down there is no backup, therefore the necessity to produce these spare parts is time critical.
  The Government seeks a remedy for this issue in the form of requiring a TDP for the LDCCs being produced and once available will be used to facilitate future competitive procurements.

N00244L332, UNIT PRICES (OCT 2001) (FISC SAN DIEGO)
Contractor unit prices, when incorporated into a Government contract, will be released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) without further notice to the contractor submitter.
  If the Contractor takes issue with the release, it should submit its proposal data with the appropriate legends and explain in detail why such data cannot be released as a public record under the Freedom of Information Act.

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation: The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible Offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government considering price and price related factors. The Government intends to award the contract to the eligible, low-priced, responsible offeror (see FAR 15.304).  Award will be made upon price reasonableness determination, contractor determination of responsibility within the meaning of FAR Part 9, and acceptance to the provisions set forth herein.
 The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
(i)	Technical capability of the item to meet the requirement
(ii)	Ability to meet the required delivery date
(iii)	Price
The Government intends to make award on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the two non-price factors. (The Government will not, however, provide additional credit for those proposals that may exceed the standards.)
Offerors proposals will be evaluated under Factor (i) above, which represents minimum acceptable criteria. Under this factor, the Government will rate the products offered as either technically acceptable or unacceptable.
 Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the entire proposal technically unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 
Only those Offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii). Under this factor, the Government will rate delivery time as either acceptable or unacceptable. Failure to receive a rating of acceptable for this factor will render the entire proposal unacceptable and the proposal may not be considered for award. 
For those proposals that are rated acceptable on Factor (i) and Factor (ii), the Government will then evaluate Factor (iii), Price.  Technical and delivery time, when combined, are equal to price.
 
At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
(b) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF PROPOSED ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), will be assessed by evaluating commercial product brochures, drawings and technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS - COMMERCIAL ITEMS, Subparagraph (b)(4) which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation. Offerors technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.
 Items offered, as provided in Offerors technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technically unacceptable. Offers which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award. 
(c) The Governments required delivery date is clearly defined above.  Ability to meet the required delivery date and shipping terms shall be demonstrated by the offerors submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required date and terms.
A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or electronically furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
 Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 
This announcement will close at 1 PM PST on 24 June 2011.  Submit offers via email to Shannon La Com who can be reached at (T) 562.626.7104 or email Shannon.lacom@navy.mil .  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  
 
Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/  . 
 
Questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing via email to the above Government point of contact.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(see attached poster below).  The restoration would recreate a series of interconnected pools and potholes of open water, intersperse open water in a 50:50 mix with emergent plants, connect pools to the main pool for water level management, improve productivity of 150 acres of the Dry Marsh, create improved habitat suitability and bio-diversity and attract an abundance of wildlife.The Fish and Wildlife Service is seeking competitive quotes on a short term lease (13 weeks) of two (2) Long Front Excavators to perform this work.  Suppliers will NOT provide operators or fuel  this will be supplied by licensed FWS employees who have completed a certified class in Heavy Equipment Operation.  The estimated time needed is 13 weeks or 520 hours.  If additional time is needed an appropriate modification will be issued reflecting the increased cost.  Period of performance starts July 5th and runs until October 3rd.  An additional line item allows for pricing the cost of delivery and return.

Regarding the1-2 hours of monthly in-person coaching, would you be open to having a one-hour on-sitecoaching session following and focusing on the material presented during the trainingsession and a one-hour telephone coaching session mid-way between the training sessions? Our experience points to telephone coaching being as effective as in-person coaching andmore cost-effective for the organization.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Additionally, a follow-on pre-solicitation conference will not be conducted. Written inquiries and comments are welcome. To maximize the ability to incorporate feedback into documents for formal coordination, feedback pertaining to the DRAFT RFP package is requested by 2 February 2011.<br /><br />The tentative schedule for a formal RFP release is 11 March 2011. Assuming this date, the anticipated deadline for receipt of the Past Performance Volume is 1 April 2011 with the technical volume due two weeks later.

Work under this PWS will support the mission of 92 Communications Squadron at Fairchild Air Force Base WA by providing highly reliable wired telecommunications and networked voice, video and data services. The Contractor shall perform Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) and other services required to ensure the Base Telecommunications System (BTS) is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

<a href="mailto:deidra.zerzavy@conus.army.mil">MICC - Fort Sill</a>
<DESC>This synopsis is notification of the Fort Sill Contracting Office's intent to award an interim bridge contract to extend the services of the current Electronic Warfare (EW) contract, for a base period of performance beginning 20 July 2011 - 24 April 2012 plus three 1-month option periods.  A competitive task order was awarded to Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems, 100 Sun Ave NE, Ste 300, Albuquerque, NM  87109-4660. The interim contract will be performed under the same terms and conditions of the existing contract, DABK01-03-D-0008-1L04, which was competitively awarded at MICC Center-Fort Eustis, Virginia, and will expire on 19 July 2011. This will be an unrestricted sole source procurement. The bridge contract will be issued to the current contractor, Northrop Grumman Space & Mission Systems, 100 Sun Ave NE, Ste 300, Albuquerque, NM  87109-4660.  The contract type is a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  This bridge contract will provide critical services to the USAFCOEFS .  This action is accomplished under authority cited in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement requires mandatory instructor certifications to be held prior to teaching this course.  Certifications normally take up to 150 days to obtain for the EW Course.  Due to time constraints there is not enough time to provide Fair Opportunity to the FCoE contractors per guidance in following the task order competitive procedures which would allow a new contractor a phase-in period for non-certified instructors to obtain certification.  Award to any other source would result in a lapse in service which would result in mission failure. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and is posted for five (5) calendar days.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this base seven month period plus five one-month option periods would be advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be issued without further notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this contract is based on this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code remains 611430.   Any comments or questions to this notice, or detailed capabilities must be emailed to Deidra Zerzavy:  deidra.zerzavy@us.army.mil or Karen Warner:  karen.l.warner@us.army.mil, at the Mission Installation Contracting Command, Fort Sill Contracting Office.<br><br><br><br>

<a href="mailto:mvasquez@blm.gov">Bureau of Land Management</a>
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for one or more pasture facilities to maintain from 800 - 5,000 wild horses each for one year, with 4 additional one year option periods. The facilities must be located in the Continental United States and provide a free-roaming environment. Based on this Request for Proposal (RFP) the Bureau of Land Management anticipates the award of one or more contracts, each contract having the capacity to maintain 800 - 5,000 wild horses for long term wild horse holding facilities located in the continental United States.  Each contract shall be for one (1) base year, plus four (4) option years. The facilities must be prepared for the conduct of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an inspection for specification compliance, to be performed by the BLM upon contract award.  Once a facility meets the minimum requirements of the EA and the specifications contained herein, BLM will begin shipping animals to the facility.  This is anticipated to occur within 90 calendar days from the date of award.  No payments shall be made until after animals are received at the facilities and have resided at the facility for a full one month period.

<DESC>The contract modification of Contract SPM75005D7426 is a sole source award to BAE Survivability Systems to extend contract coverage for the NSNs and PNs for the Up Armored HMMWV.  Listed below are the sole source FSCs which we propose to award a 181 day contract: 1005, 1010, 2040, 2510, 2530, 2540, 2590, 2815, 3040, 3110, 3120, 3830, 3990, 4010, 4130, 4210, 4210, 4320, 4710, 4720, 4730, 5305, 5306, 5307, 5310, 5320, 5325, 5330, 5340, 5365, 5930, 5945, 5970, 5975, 5985, 6150, 7690, 9320, 9340, 9515 and 9905. The contract is for a period of 181 days pending the award of the successor solicitation SPM7LX08R0179.  The current contract will expire on March 16, 2010 and this contract will incorporate all technical products and service requirements and contract terms and conditions contained within Contract SPM75005D7426 by a contract modification action. The sole source award by contract modification is being issued through other than full and open competition procedures (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B)) and will expire on September 13, 2010.

There is currently a large Army reset program in the works and any delay in the procurement process will impact readiness of the Up Armored HMMWV fleet.  These vehicles are those that are needed in support of SWA.  The current contract with BAE is helping us maintain a readiness rate of 92%.  With the contract currently in place with BAE, they can support these urgent requirements and can supply these items with a delivery of 5-10 days (depending on Priority code) directly to the customer. It is in the Governments best interest to make this sole source award to BAE Survivability Systems.

If you should have any questions or concerns about this notice, or if you have an interest in this procurement, please contact Margaret Mickey at 614-692-8868 or email at margaret.mickey@dla.mil.

The award for Portion #1 will be made before the award for Portion #2 and award for Portion #2 will be made before the award for Portion #3. To ensure that multiple sources are available, and to ensure the continuous availability of reliable sources of supply, the offeror who is selected as the best value for Portion #1 will be eliminated from competition on Portion #2 and Portion #3, and the offeror who is selected as the best value for Portion #2 will be eliminated from competition on Portion #3 based on the authority in FAR 6.202(a)(4).

<DESC>06/09/2011 Amendment 9 Notice and Q&amp;A
<p>Notice<br />No classified documents will be distributed Friday, June 10 or Monday, June 13. For those vendors that are eligible to receive classified documents under this Solicitation, as confirmed, follow the same instructions but with a suggested date and time other than 06/10 or 06/13.</p>
<p>Q29. We offer A/E design and facility assessment services globally. Is it anticipated that these services will be required to assist in the decision-making process for the deployment of the systems discussed to the field? We are assuming that fixed systems, in particular, could be deployed in facilities that could require renovations/upgrades to house and/or secure the equipment. Additionally, we assume that facility assessments could be required to confirm whether sufficient utility services and physical infrastructure is in place to accommodate the installation of deployed systems into existing facilities. Are these assumptions consistent with the projected requirements for this contract?<br />A29. Generally, this Solicitation has portable field assessments, not fixed.</p>
<p>Q30. Can we substitute 5 years of experience for a Bachelor's degree? As you know, all positions require a minimum of a Bachelors. We have several individuals that meet all of the requirements (retired military) accept for the four-year bachelor's degree. Please let me know.<br />A30. The Government will evaluate all proposals using the instructions stated in the Solicitation. Using those standards, the possibility exists that experience directly related to the position may be substituted.</p>
<p>Q31. Can we submit resumes as an annex to the Tech-Management Volume? We will certainly address personnel in our Tech &amp; Management Volume, but we would prefer to submit resumes as an annex.<br />Q31. Are resumes part of the 25 page limit?<br />A31. Resumes will not count towards the page limit and may be submitted as an appendix, keeping them in the same section.</p>
<p>Q32. Re the classified Statement of Work, should the job titles in tasks 3 and 4, be unclassified while leaving the descriptions classified?<br />A32. The job titles are unclassified and the final SOW is updated to reflect this change.</p>
<p>Q33. Can there be a clarification as to the distinction between having a SCIF and the contractor's ability to handle classified information?<br />A33. A Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) is an area accredited by an individual agency, and that accrediting authority is responsible for the protection of Sensitive Compartmented Information as well as any other classified information processed within the SCIF. For this Solicitation, the level of safeguarding needs to be determined by the Defense Security Service, as verified by a company's CAGE.</p>
<p><br />Q34. Will the Government allow offerors to submit part/all of the proposal at the SCI level instead of SECRET/NOFORN?<br />A34. You determine the level of classification; the Government will accept a proposal at the SCI level. The Government has no preference as to classification level.</p>
<p>Q35. One mission of the SCEO is to provide unbiased analysis and assessments of special communication capabilities and field hardware. Does this constitute an un-mitigatable organizational conflict of interest for special communication systems and field hardware developers since they cannot provide this unbiased analysis and assessment of their own corporation's product.<br />Q35. There is an indication that the contractor will review JCIDS documents. If a contractor is involved in building a system will an OCI mitigation plan be required? What will be the submission requirements?<br />A35. Though this occurrence is expected to be rare, if a contractor is involved in building a system, an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) mitigation plan will be required. If an offeror chooses to address a possible OCI issue, that should be included in the proposal as an appendix without page limit in Section 2 Technical and Management.</p>
<p>Q36. In the Solicitation, Section M.1.3 concerning Section 2 - Technical Management, the Technical Approach sub-factor 2b, indicates that field assessment requirements are derived from Task 4. The SOW says Task 3.<br />A36. Section M.1.3 should say Task 3. However, all positions may be pulled to assist.</p>
<p>Q37. In the SOW paragraph 10.4.1, the 5-year ... experience conflicts with the Junior Engineer position requiring 2 years experience. Is it 2 years for Junior?<br />A37. Two years experience is required for Junior, not five. Please also see Q30 and A30.</p>
<p>Q38. Who pays for the training and time if firearms are necessary for staff?<br />A38. Certain courses are required by the Government, as specialized and specific training. Government-mandated training will likely be paid for by the Government.</p>
<p>Q39. Is the growth rate of the staff gradual? Is space the main factor restricting growth? Will additional FTEs be needed if office space increases? <br />A39. The growth rate is dependent on many variables, such as requirements, mission priorities, funding. Space or lack of space does not determine mission response or requirements.</p>
<p>Q40. There are multiple levels indicated for engineers. See the numbers in the cost worksheet. What do those mean?<br />A40. Please remove those levels or numbers in the cost worksheet. I will post another cost worksheet. The levels are Senior, Mid or junior.</p>
<p>Q41. SCEO is a 24/7 program. If contract support is required during non-duty hours, how will it be addressed? <br />A41. 24/7 operations for the DoD SCEO are very rare, i.e., once a year and are of short duration, such as 1 to 2 days. The requirement for contractor personnel to support 24/7 operations is also rare. Planning for this requirement should be considered an extreme contingency. In those instances where contractor personnel are required on a 24/7 basis, the Contracting Officer's Representative and the Contracting Officer will work with contractor personnel, especially Program Management and Contracting Staff, to satisfy the requirement.</p>
<p>Q42. The requirement for arming the contractors indicates that it will be done on a 'voluntary' basis, can this be clarified? Will the Government consider paying "Hazard Pay" if appropriate?<br />A42. The Government does not make it mandatory for contractor personnel to carry weapons. Therefore, the company is responsible for providing personnel who may be willing to support a Government requirement to be armed. The Government will pay contractor personnel for in accordance with all applicable regulations.</p>
<p>Q43. Will architectures be developed in accordance with the DoDAF Framework?<br />A43. Though the DoD SCEO only plays a consultative role in architecture development the end results within DoD will usually follow a DoDAF Framework. The DoDAF is the standard that is followed.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>The OHISS project will develop an airborne icing capability that will provide low speed mission support at low altitudes, have a larger cloud capable of full immersion of a test aircraft rotor or fuselage, if desired, and be able to accurately simulate natural rain and Federal Aviation Administration icing conditions.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: 
Purchase of specialized equipment to be used with the upgraded Siemens Trio MRI Scanner and 32 channel head coil located at the VA Boston Healthcare System JP Campus.  The equipment is specifically designed to present visual and auditory stimuli for functional neuroimaging studies and includes:

a.	Silent Vision Model SV-7021 Fiber Optic Visual System
-	Includes one each of the following:  Video Interface, Binocular Projector/Image Guides/Glasses 3 - Axis Glasses Mount DC Power & Fiber Optic Cables Consolidation Cart
b.	 Real Eye Model RE-4701 Eye Imaging System

e.	RE-4701 System requires software option: iView X Eye Tracking Processing System

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: 
The Silent Vision Model SV7021 Fibre Optic system is a stereoscopic goggle/projection based system for presenting visual information to someone within the bore of the MRI scanner. It is specifically designed to work with the new 32 channel head coil and is completely certified to be MRI inert and safe to use in the scanner room.  

Real Eye Model RE-4701 is a system designed to track eye movements when presenting visual information.  It can only be used with the SV 7021.

Silent Scan Model SS-3100 Audio System is used to deliver auditory information via headphones to individuals in the MRI bore.  It is designed to be compatible with the other Avotec components.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: 

	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  Avotec has received US patents for both the fiber optic glasses as well as our eye monitoring system SV 7021.  



6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed 
Systems to be used with the Siemens upgrade were thoroughly investigated.  The Avotec systems are the only ones that were acceptable for the following reasons:

The SV 7021 accepts dual, independent XVGA inputs (1024x768), which is the highest resolution available in a binocular visual system for MR use.
The SV 7021 can be ordered with the Real Eye 4901 eye monitoring system for eye tracking   (when combined with the eye tracking software). The Real Eye 4901 is actually built into the SV 7021 glasses.  Not only does this give unparalleled, simultaneous visual presentation and eye monitoring, it also results in an eye monitoring /tracking system that is extremely easy to use since there are no adjustments required. 
Avotec has received US patents for both the fiber optic glasses as well as our eye monitoring system SV 7021.

1.	Real Eye 4901 - #5,892,566
2.	Fiber Optic Glasses - #5,414,459

The SV 7021 and Real Eye 4901 are completely MR inert in the Siemens Trio. 
The SV 7021 and RE 4901 are designed to minimize set up time for the Siemens Trio.
Avotec has the only MR inert fiber optic glasses that will mount on the Siemens 32 channel head coil.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:   The total cost of this requirement is $111,400.00.  Market research was performed.  A combined synopsis/solicitation, VA-241-11-RQ-0778, was posted on FBO May 24, 2011 - May 25, 2011 and there were no responses received.  The Contracting Officer determined that the anticipated price will be fair and reasonable based on the fact that Avotec is the sole manufacturer of these items and the items are not available for sale through any other vendor.  The vendor, Avotec, is providing a $13,300.00 discount off of the retail pricing making this a best value for the government.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Upgrade to existing equipment on station.  Market research was performed.  A combined synopsis/solicitation, VA-241-11-RQ-0778, was posted on FBO May 24, 2011 - May 25, 2011 and there were no responses received.  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  N/A

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section VI above

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:   Contracting Activity will continue to encourage brand name of equivalent specifications.
