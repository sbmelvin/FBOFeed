<CONTACT>Andrew Steed Contract Specialist 2022734216     ; Linda Blake Contract Specialist 2022734212     ;
<DESC>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has a requirement for Verbatim Reporting and Transcription Services (VR&TS).  This requirement is being conducted as a pilot in two NLRB Regional Offices:  Region 6, Pittsburgh, PA, and Region 27, Denver, CO.  The period of performance will be one (1) year, beginning January 1, 2004.  In prior years, only one (1) contract was awarded for each Regional Office and included all of the geographical boundaries.  Under this pilot, bids submitted will be awarded for the areas serviced by each state within the Regions, and will include all of the geographical boundaries serviced by that state.  For Region 6 the states and areas are: (1) [Pennsylvania], which services Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Bedford; Blair, Butler, Cambria, Cameron, Centre, Clarion, Clearfield, Clinton, Crawford, Elk, Erie, Fayette, Forest, Fulton, Greene, Huntingdon, Indiana, Jefferson, Lawrence, McKean, Mercer, Miffiin, Potter, Somerset, Venango, Warren, Washington, and Westmoreland Counties; and (2) [West Virginia], which services Barbour, Braxton, Brooke, Calhoun, Doddridge, Gilmer, Hancock, Harrison, Lewis, Marion, Marshall, Monogalia, Ohio, Pleasants, Pocahontas, Preston, Randolph, Ritchie, Taylor, Tucker, Tyler, Upshur, Webster, Wetzel, Wirt, and Wood Counties.  For Region 27 the states and areas are:  (1) [Colorado], (2) [Utah], and (3) [Wyoming], which services the entire states;  (4) [Idaho], which services Ada, Bannock, Bear Lake, Gingham, Blaine, Boise, Bonneville, Butte, Camas, Canyon, Caribou, Cassia, Elmore, Franklin, Gem, Gooding, Jefferson, Jerome, Lincoln, Madison, Minidoka, Oneida, Owyhee, Payette, Power, Teton, Twin Falls, and Washington Counties; (5) [Montana], which services Big Horn, Blaine, Carbon, Carter, Chouteau, Custer, Daniels, Dawson, Fallon, Fergus, Garfield, Gold Valley, Hill, Judith Basin, McCone, Musselshell, Park, Petroleum, Phillips, Powder River, Prairie, Richland, Roosevelt, Rosebud, Sheridan, Stillwater, Sweetgrass, Treasure, Valley , Wheatland, Wibaux, and Yellowstone Counties; and (6) [Nebraska], which services Banner, Box Butte, Cheyenne, Dawes, Deuel, Garden, Kimball, Morrill, Scotts Bluff, Sheridan, and Sioux Counties.  Because this is a pilot, no prior history of the number of hearings held or page volumes exist for the states of Idaho and Nebraska.  Over the past 12 months (October 2002 to September 2003), an estimated 82 hearings were held in Pennsylvania for an estimated 8906 pages of transcript; in West Virginia, an estimated 13 hearings were held for an estimated 2,545 pages; in Colorado, an estimated 14 hearings were held for an estimated 3,696 pages; in Montana, an estimated 2 hearings held for an estimated 22 pages; in Utah, an estimated 4 hearings were held for 401 pages; and in Wyoming, one estimated hearing was held for an estimated 395 pages.  These figures represent estimates and could vary from month to month.  The prices bid for these services will include an original and duplicate copy of the transcript, original and duplicate copy of the exhibits, all recordings, transcribing, and necessary postage or other transportation charges to deliver the verbatim transcript of all Board (i.e., the "Board" means NLRB) case hearings.  Price also includes all travel expenses to any location serviced by the state for which the bid is submitted.  Once the solicitation has been issued on or about November 25, 2003, no deviations to the solicitation's requirements will be accepted from any bidder.  The bidders must demonstrate extensive court reporting experience for VR&TS.  The acquisition strategy for this requirement will be full and open competition under a 100 percent small business set-aside.  NLRB will use FAR Parts 12, 13, and 15.  FAR Part 13 will have precedent over FAR Parts 12 and 15.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 561492, Court Reporting Services.

<DESC>The U. S. Postal Service is soliciting Qualification Statements from construction firms desiring to be placed on a list of prequalified design-build general contractors for construction of new or expanded postal facilities in the State of Hawaii.  The buildings are expected to range in size from approximately 8,000 square feet to 50,000 square feet, with a construction cost of $1.0 million to $7.5 million, and are categorized as carrier annexes, postal retail facilities, delivery distribution centers, main post offices, stations or branches.  No fixed mechanization is included in these projects. Only the most qualified contractors will be prequalified.  To be considered for prequalification, respondents must demonstrate a minimum of five years of design-build experience and have completed a minimum of two comparable projects in the State of Hawaii over the past five years.  Comparable projects for the purpose of this solicitation are defined as design-build new construction or expansion projects of commercial/light industrial type facilities with a minimum of 20,000 square feet in size and a construction cost of at least $2.0 million.  Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  Experience and references (60%); organization (25%); safety (15%).  Other factors that will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis are:  backlog, financial capability, bonding, banking, responsibility and affirmation.  The Postal Service will issue individual project solicitations to prequalified firms only.  Each solicitation will request a fixed price proposal.  Prequalified firms will have the option to submit a proposal for one or all of the projects as they become available.  Prequalified design/build firms are not obligated to submit proposals in response to a Postal Service solicitation.  Awards of individual contracts will be made to the firm offering the best value to the Postal Service within available funding in accordance with evaluation criteria stated in individual project solicitations. The Postal Service retains the right to:  (1) Delete from the prequalified list any design/build firm that is no longer deemed to be responsible or is otherwise ineligible to receive a contract award pursuant to the Postal Service Purchasing Manual. (2) Prequalify additional design/build firms that will be eligible to receive solicitations for facilities to be constructed and/or expanded.  This right will be exercised when the number of existing prequalified firms is not sufficient to ensure adequate competition. (3) Issue open-market solicitations for specific design/build projects when determined by the contracting officer to be in the best interest of the Postal Service.  This list of prequalified firms will have periodic maintenance for adding/deleting firms as required with a minimum review annually.  Qualification Statement packages may be obtained by sending an email request to nancy.young@usps.gov or grace.b.zipagan@usps.gov.  Qualification Statement packages will be emailed to the requestor.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for Optical Diagnostic System (ODS) for Solar Sails Team at LaRC to develop interface requirements with the L'Garde 20m Solar Sails. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from L'Garde, Inc who is the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements. The information required to do the work (design information for the 20 m L'Garde solar sail system) is proprietary to L'Garde, Inc.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to provide a similar or compatible product and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on December 9, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development Mission in Peru (USAID/Peru) is seeking proposals from qualified institutions to be the lead management and implementation contractor under a four-year cost plus award fee contract in support of the Alternative Development Program (ADP).  The ADP is a major component of the U.S. and Peruvian Governmentsí counter-narcotics strategy to eliminate all illicit coca in Peru by 2007.  The contractor will have lead responsibility for ensuring that coca leaf eradication performed by farmers (ìauto-eradicationî) meets annual targets, for leading a communications strategy geared to providing timely information about the ADP to multiple audiences and to creating a permanent change in behavior by former coca farm families, and for monitoring and reporting on overall development activities tied to auto-eradication.  They will also have the lead responsibility for coordinating information from several sector-specific interventions (e.g., democracy, business investment, health, education, resources management) implemented by other organizations supporting the ADP with longer-term, sustainable development programs.  Offerorís proposals must show solid experience working with alternative development programs in Latin America under circumstances that can be confrontational and influenced by narcotics trafficking and political unrest.  Of high importance is the ability to field senior personnel with experience in managing a complex, multi-sector, rural alternative development program subject to changing and unpredictable challenges.  The contractor will have a short overlap period with the incumbent contractor, whose current 18-month contract terminates at the end of March 2004.  The contractor will be expected to take over the responsibilities and commitments of the incumbent without a pause in operations and with an intense focus on achieving results.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to implement the program to help Madagascar achieve effective management and control of its forest ecosystems.  The primary means by which this purpose can be met, and which will be the most important activity in this contract, is to revamp and revitalize the Malagasy Forest Service to ensure sustainable forest management.  The role and value of forests in Madagascar has been insufficiently recognized in development policy and planning, yet the value of forests to economic and ecological systems is indisputable.  Forests provide essential environmental services including protecting urban and agricultural watersheds, cycling nutrients, providing local and global tempering of climate, sequestering of carbon, buffering the spread of pests and pathogens, offering recreational and aesthetic benefits, and others.  In addition, forests offer economic benefits in the form of timber and non-timber resources, and increasingly for ecotourism.  

The work conducted under the Contract awarded through this RFP will be integrated with implementation mechanisms for other activities under the overall strategic objective for Environment and Rural Development.  We anticipate issuing the RFP o/a December 1, 2003.

<SUBJECT>B -- Livestock and Meat Marketing Study

<DESC>Expected ResultsóGIPSA and APHIS require a comprehensive study of the use, reasons for use, and economic effects of various types of spot and non-spot methods for transferring cattle, hogs, sheep, beef, pork, and lamb between successive stages of the production and marketing system from farmers to retailers.  The study will examine all types of marketing arrangements that are used in the cattle, hog, lamb and meat industries from farms to retailers to determine what types of marketing arrangements are used, their terms and availability, and why firms use them; examine their effects on prices, productivity, costs, livestock and meat quality, and business risks; examine their implications for price discovery, risk management, thin markets, competitiveness among meats, ease of entry, concentration in livestock production, feeding and meatpacking, structure of the livestock and meatpacking industries; and examine the implications of restricting packer ownership of livestock before they are ready for slaughter and other arrangements through which packers agree to purchase livestock before they are ready for slaughter. The study is expected to: 1.  Give producers better information on which to base their decisions about whether to participate in non-traditional marketing arrangements and, if so, which types of arrangements are best suited to their needs. 2.  Contribute to better public understanding of the role of alternative marketing arrangements, the extent of their use, reasons why firms enter into them, and the implications of such arrangements.  3.  Help identify emerging marketing information needs of livestock producers and other market participants.  
4.  Make an important contribution to USDA and Congress in deciding whether restrictions on use of captive supplies are warranted.  5.  Assist GIPSA in enforcing the P&S Act by contributing to the Agencyís understanding of changing marketing practices and by identifying areas that the Agency may need to include in its investigation plans.  Coordination to Achieve ObjectivesóThe proposed study is complex and will likely require coordination among several research activities.  Parts of the study require industry knowledge, including an understanding of marketing practices in beef, swine, lamb and meat marketing.  The study will require knowledge of statistical sampling, economic and econometric analysis, and other scientific methods.  Parts of the study may require expertise in economic engineering, industrial engineering, operations research methods, and other academic disciplines.  GIPSA may need to enable Contractors to obtain some data under the authorities of the Packers and stockyards Act of 1921; other data will need to be obtained through voluntary submissions by respondents.  All data collection will require OMB clearance.  USDA would prefer to award a single contract, although separate contracts may be awarded for cattle, hogs and lambs.  Due to the complexity of the study and need for a wide range of expertise, joint ventures, subcontracting and other collaborations among various parties may be needed.  The solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis. NAICS Code 541910 Size Standard: $ 6 million dollar average annual receipts. It is anticipated that the formal solicitation, Request for Proposal (RFP), will be released on or about December 1, 2003. A pre-proposal conference is anticipated; date, time and location to be determined. Requestor shall include name, address, telephone number, email address and the solicitation number.  Requests must be mailed to the contracting office to the attention of Barbara Veres or faxed to (301)734-8871.  Email requests are acceptable.  The email address is: Barbara.L.Veres@aphis.usda.gov.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.

<DESC>NA BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT Introduction:  This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2).  A formal Request for Proposal (RFP), solicitation and/or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued.  Requests for an RFP will be disregarded. The Office of Net Assessment (ONA) will not issue paper copies of this announcement.  The ONA reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals in response to this announcement.  The ONA reserves the right to fund all, some, or non e of the proposals received under this BAA.  ONA provides no funding for direct reimbursement of concept paper or proposal development costs.  Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned and i nstitutions whose proposals are not funded will not be advised of nonacceptance.  It is the policy of the ONA to treat all concept papers and proposals as sensitive competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation. I.  ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION This BAA is restricted to institutions of higher education (colleges and universities), inclusive of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) which may submit proposal(s), for consideration by the Government.   II.  GENERAL INFORMATION 1.  Agency Name: Office of Net Assessment 1920 Defense Pentagon Room 3A930 Washington, DC 20301 2.  Research Opportunity Title and Program Name: Research and Studies for the Office of Net Assessment 3.  Research Opportunity Number: BAA-OSDNA-04-0001 4.  Response Date: Proposals Due:  January 8, 2004 5.  Research Opportunity Description: The Office of Net Assessment conducts and sponsors analyses that compare the standing, trends, and future prospects of US and foreign military capability and military potential.  Priority is given to assessing aspects of the security environment and parts of the world that are likely to change in the future, and that may present threats or opportunities to the US.  Assessments may focus on specific theaters, regions, functions, mission areas, major weapons categories, doctrine, etc., as well as on demograph ic, economic, and political developments that may affect the power and strategies of nations. Objective and Areas of Interest:  The Office of Net Assessment seeks proposals, from Institutions of Higher Education √¢¬Ä¬ì Colleges and Universities, that respond to the following areas of interest.  Proposals will be considered that undertake comprehens ive approaches to one or more of the following areas, or that investigate one or more particular aspect(s) or case(s) that belong to the broader area: 5.1.  Asian Military Balance:  The Office of Net Assessment is interested in developing a fuller and deeper understanding of the emerging strategic competition in Asia.  Work in this area might include studies of the history of international military-strat egic competition in the region; analyses of the network of nations/powers in Asia and the interaction of the United States with that network; and the consideration of regional trends in demography, economics, energy consumption, etc., and the implications of these trends.  Studies might also examine the perceptions of Asian nations: what do nations in this region pay attention to, in the policies, posture, and behavior of the United States as well as other nations in the region? 5.2.  Precision Strike and Robotics: The further development and eventual proliferation of technologies associated with long-range precision strike, to include the operation and exploitation of robotic system, will continue to shape the character of future  conflict.  The Office of Net Assessment is interested in studies of how new technologies and operational/organizational concepts may transform armed conflict; how the pro liferation of long-range strike capabilities may change how other countries perceive and conduct warfare, not just against the United States but against other countries as well, and; how other countries may adapt precision-strike and robotic systems to sui t their own strategic and military priorities.  On the topic of robotics and unmanned systems more generally, work may include analyses of the evolution of robotic systems in the military and other elements of the U.S. industrial sector; historical studies  of others' experiments with robotic systems, and; the prospects for other countries in developing and employing unmanned systems. 5.3.  Air Dominance, Missile Defense, and Power Projection: How, historically, has the United States exploited its dominance of the air, and how has this been reflected in U.S. military strategy?  Looking ahead, how is the contest for air dominance changin g?  How is the introduction and proliferation of unmanned systems (to include cruise and ballistic missiles) changing existing notions of air superiority?  What are the social, cultural, and other factors that shape a military's ability to produce a highly  capable air force?  What is the likely shape of the future air attack-air defense competition? 5.4.  Training: Rigorous, realistic military training has often equaled victory on the battlefield.  The Office of Net Assessment is interested in historical studies of military training (from the ancient world to the modern day); analyses of the social an d cultural factors conducive to successful training, and; studies of how other countries and other militaries have historically approached the training of their forces.  Studies may also address the likely future directions of military training: What sorts  of new technologies may change or even revolutionize existing approaches to training?  What might a new training-support infrastructure look like?   The following topics are provided to support the research areas identified above: √Ç¬∑	PRC strategic culture; √Ç¬∑	the role of familiy-kinship-caste relationships in Asian strategic decision making (that is, the sources of Asian institutional and bureaucratic behavior); √Ç¬∑	the costs and benefits of information abundance in networked military systems; √Ç¬∑	the ability of the US national economy to sustain the current American position of military preeminence over the long run; √Ç¬∑	developments in the biological or human sciences affecting the enhancement of human performance in the conduct of military operations, and; √Ç¬∑	exploration of American long-term strategic choices in the evolving international security environment in conjunction with major emerging trends or discontinuities of the FSU itself. 6.

EVALUATION INFORMATION These submissions will be selected through a technical/scientific/cost decision process with technical and scientific considerations being more important than cost.  Even though cost is of less importance than all the technical factors combined, it will be  considered in the overall evaluation.  The degree of its importance will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factors on which selection is to be based, or when the cost is so significantly high as to diminish the  value of the technical superiority to the Government.

<CONTACT>Dianne Mitchell Contracting Officer 4045623163575 dianne_mitchell@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service requests proposals for providing Maintenance Services at the Natchez Trace Parkway in Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi.  The work to be performed under this solicitation is performance-based turn-key maintenance support services, encompassing all maintenance and repair for the Natchez Trace Parkway.  This solicitation is part of a Standard Competition being conducted under the requirements of OMB Circular A-76, dated May 29, 2003.  The purpose of the competition is to determine whether accomplishing the specified work under contract or by agency performance is more economical.  If agency performance is determined to be more economical, this solicitation will be canceled and no contract will be awarded.  The solicitation covers phase-in plus a base and four option performance periods.  The phase-in period is 3 months in length, while the base period and each option period are 12 months long (not-to-exceed 5 years).  Should a contract be awarded the estimated phase-in start date will be July 1, 2004.  In addition, the Service Provider will be required to give Government employees who have been or will be adversely affected or separated as a result of award of the contract the right of first refusal for employment openings under the contract in positions for which they are qualified, if that employment is consistent with post-Government employment conflict of interest standards.  The Natchez Trace Parkway is a unit of the National Park system and is not only dedicated to preserving the history associated with one of the country's earliest trails, but also provides scenic, cultural, natural, and recreational opportunities to 14 million visitors annually.  The Natchez Trace Parkway is an elongated park of 51,150 acres covering a distance of 444 miles between Natchez, Mississippi and Nashville, Tennessee with a boundary of almost 1,000 linear miles and an average width of 825 feet along its entire length.  The Parkway motor road is a 22-foot wide two-lane modern roadway, with limited access from adjoining properties and no commercial traffic allowed.  The Parkway is designed for pleasure traveling, providing for a leisurely motoring experience through a rural or natural setting, and embracing scenic, recreational, and historic features of national significance.  The Parkway has been recognized by the American Society of Landscape Architects for its excellence in landscape architectural design and is eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.  It is one of only twelve All-American Roads in the entire United States.  Interactions with the general public and the overall high standards of maintenance expected from the Service Provider are atypical of usual maintenance support services requirements.  Therefore, the Service Provider will be expected to understand the vision and operating concepts of the National Park System and to perform the work within the scope of that vision.  The Service Provider will be the National Park Service's Maintenance Partner at the Parkway and, as such, will be responsible for accomplishment of all aspects of maintenance.  The major functional areas included in the work are Parkway mowing, custodial services, roads maintenance, grounds maintenance, building maintenance, operation and maintenance of utility systems, maintenance of the Parkway radio communications system, trails maintenance, maintenance support services for special and seasonal events, shop operations and equipment maintenance, and maintenance associated with marine and waterways.  A preproposal conference and site visit will be held and offerors are strongly urged to attend.  This acquisition will be accomplished utilizing the Lowest Price/Technically Acceptable source selection process, as defined in FAR 15.101-2.  Tradeoffs will not be made.  Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of the responsive, responsible proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-price factors.  The following factors will be evaluated: quality, past performance, and price.  This procurement is open to all sources.  The applicable NAICS code is 561210-Facility Support Services (as defined for Base Maintenance Services) with an associated size standard of $23.0 million.  The solicitation package will be available on or about December 3, 2003.  Due to the size of the solicitation and its attachments, the solicitation will be issued electronically on a compact disc and mailed to requestors.  The documents on the disc will be in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, Adobe PDF, HTML and TIF image formats.  Requests for copies of the solicitation disc may be in written or electronic form, and may be sent to the address listed in this notice or E-Mailed to dianne_mitchell@nps.gov

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG),  Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program (EBP) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC), 1 Medical Center Drive, Lebanon, NH 03756, to study pregnancy hormones in maternal and cord blood from twin and singleton pregnancies. 
The EBP is pursuing a research program to investigate the effects of prenatal exposures on adult cancer risk.  One such exposure is having been the product of a twin pregnancy, which is associated with breast cancer risk in daughters.  The Government is studying the relationship of pregnancy hormone levels in maternal and cord blood samples with twinning to further our understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the association with breast cancer.  The primary study aim is to provide new data on and to test the existing hypothesis that differences in cord estriol between twin and singleton pregnancies contribute to the biological mechanism underlying the altered cancer risk in twins.  Additionally, hypotheses that several other estrogens and androgens, prolactin, AFP and IGF differ between twin and singleton pregnancies and could mediate the altered cancer risk in twins will be explored.  Our secondary aim is to explore differences in these hormones between di- and monochorionic twin pregnancies.  Through evaluation of data in medical charts, pathology reports, and serum samples, NCI hopes to gain a better understanding of the relationship of hormone levels in twin pregnancies to breast cancer.   NCI will obtain maternal and cord blood samples from approximately 100 pregnancies and use these data, along with the information abstracted from medical records to form a conclusion regarding this relationship.  DHMC is the only high-risk obstetrics and gynecology medical practice that DCEG/EBP is aware of that:  1) has the information required from clinical medical records routinely ascertained and computerized; 2) has pathologic information on placentas that is routinely recorded and computerized on  twin pregnancies.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.   However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above service, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EST, on December 3, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS 541990.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to enter into a sole source contract, on behalf of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), with The National Academies (NAS), 2101 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. under the authority of 41 U.S.C. ß253(c)(1) ñ Only one responsible source.  This procurement requires independent expertise of the nationally recognized membership of the NAS/Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB).  NAS is uniquely qualified to perform this requirement based on its breadth of available academic, government and private sector resources from which it draws its expertise and knowledge in the area of wireless technology and related policy.

The CSTB will convene a workshop, entitled Spectrum Management Policy Reform, that shall examine the goals identified in the Executive Memorandum, signed by President Bush on May 29, 2003, addressing spectrum management: 1) facilitation of a modernized and improved spectrum management system; 2) facilitation of policy changes to create incentives for more efficient and beneficial use of spectrum and to provide a higher degree of predictability and certainty in the spectrum management process as it applies to incumbent users; 3) development of policy tools to streamline the deployment of new and expanded services and technologies, while preserving national security, homeland security, and public safety, and encouraging scientific research; and 4) development of means to address the critical spectrum needs of national security, homeland security, public safety, Federal transportation infrastructure, and science.  The public workshop, to be conducted during February 2004, would include approximately 30 invited parties, along with the members of the CSTBís Committee on Wireless Technology Prospects and Policy.  Within 14 days of the conclusion of the workshop, NAS will provide to NTIA a transcript and copies of panelists' written presentations that are collected for and/or distributed for the workshop, in their entirety.  Within 45 days of the conclusion of the workshop, NAS will provide to NTIA a report summarizing the workshop and reproducing the panelists' written presentations.  The report will be made available to the public 14 days after its release to NTIA.

The experience of the NAS in conducting highly successful and nationally recognized fora will bring efficiency and economy to this operation.  The Government anticipates the award of a fixed-price contract on or after December 17, 2003.  The proposed requirement is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, the Government will consider all capability statements received within 15 days of this posting.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A Request for Proposal (RFP) package is not available.  (See Notes 22).

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541612   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Office of Air and Radiation intends to award fixed-price Purchase Order using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This announcement is published as a small  business set aside.  The provisions at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items,  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items and FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, apply to this  acquisition.  The Government will award a Purchase Order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation provisions, will be the most advantageous to the Government, cost and other factors considered.  BACKGROUND: The OAR  Diversity Action  Plan Workgroup (DAP),  established in 1997, is comprised of  Special Emphasis Program Managers (African American, Asian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, Disabled), Union representatives from the American Federation of Government Employees,   National Treasury Employees Union, and one representative from  each of the six program and staff offices.  The workgroup was charged with developing specific goals and activities that would respond to concerns raised by minority employees during a series of focus groups convened at the request of the Agency.  These included addressing the removal of barriers  identified by focus group participants in the areas of  recruitment, hiring, promotions, awards and training. In addressing the concerns, the DAP met with OAR's Assistant Administrator and Deputy Assistant Administrators and established milestones and goals to monitor progress toward ensuring that  OAR is an environment that is consistently fair, equitable, and inclusive of all members of our workforce without prejudice.  The primary themes focused on affirmative employment, maintaining and utilizing a diverse workforce,  recruitment strategies to reflect increased diversity from  under-represented groups,  leadership  management,  team building; and, employee development wherein every OAR employee can develop to his or her fullest potential. The DAP intends to collect data on progress made by conducting a "Workforce Survey" (WS) of OAR's approximately 1325 employees  throughout the United States.  Data from the WS will be used to enhance OAR's Diversity Action Plan, and to assist OAR Executive Leadership and management teams in planning program links to the OAR/Agency Human Capitol Strategy where critical developmental needs will have been identified. The OAR  WS will also take into account current Agency moves toward establishing a systematic process for strategic workforce planning (commonly referred to as the EPA National Strategic Workforce Planning System Project).  These links will allow OAR to maintain commitments to create a work environment  which emphasizes accountability, equity, opportunity, and trust.  The Workforce Survey will serve as a road map in reviewing progress towards goals established in 1997 and identifying any modifications necessary in 2004 and beyond.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), Headquarters Procurement Division intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Specialized Technical Services (STS), 2794 Indian Ripple Road, Beavercreek, OH 45440 in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1: ìOnly one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.î  The reason justifying the lack of competition is that STS is the only company that has Low Profile Night Vision Goggles (LPNVG) that meet the Government's requirements.  Based on market research, other companies' night vision goggles are not low profile in design, do not incorporate a built-in heads-up display, do not have dual image tube capability, do not provide adequate depth perception for driving watercraft, and are not waterproof.  The Operational Requirements Document (ORD) for the LPNVG defines this requirement and requires that the system be lightweight, compact for ease of use, and provide an abridged profile that reduces the neck strain on the user.  It must be simple to operate (by a soldier with minimal dexterity), and shall incorporate a low hardware profile configuration, a see-through capability, and a built-in Heads-Up Display (HUD). The system is worn during periods of limited visibility/darkness in order to enhance combat effectiveness. It uses multiple mounting capabilities (i.e., head harness, fixed mount, helmet strap, etc). The LPNVG system shall be a small, lightweight, ruggedized image intensifier (I≤) system that incorporates GEN lll/GEN IV image intensifier tube technology. The system is used for target detection, recognition, identification and as a navigational aid.  The low hardware profile assembly shall not exceed a threshold size of 8 cm depth, and a weight threshold of 750 g. The see-through field-of-view shall afford a +15∞ to -80∞ inch vertical and 165∞ horizontal capability. The image intensified field-of-view is 40∞ in each monocular of the binocular goggle system. The HUD shall use a º VGA active matrix twisted-nematic miniature LCD display in the beam combiner. The system must operate at altitudes up to 35,000 feet. Operating temperature range must be -30∞ C to 52∞ C, with the ability to function in humid environments of 95% relative humidity up to 49∞ C and capable of withstanding saltwater immersion to 10 meters. The Government also needs full logistics support for these items.  It is anticipated that the contract type shall be a five-year indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract with a maximum of $4,000,000.  See Note 22 for any responses to this announcement.  Any questions regarding the above requirement should be submitted in writing via fax or email to Mr. John Hayes at (813) 828-7504 or hayesd@socom.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTIFICATION OF INTENT TO PROCURE SERVICES TO FACILITATE THE FABRICATION OF NANOPARTICLES/BIOMATERIALS WITH IN THE NCI NANOTECHNOLOGY PROGRAM ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS TO OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY

The requirement is to acquire the services a contractor to provide personnel to facilitate the fabrication of nanoparticles/biomaterials.  The NCI is developing a technologies program focused nanotechnology approaches to creating new diagnostic, prevention, and treatment modalities.  Nanotechnology has the promise to provide new strategies for cancer detection and intervention at its most fundamental levels and at the earliest possible time.

The NCI nanotechnology program is establishing a new pipeline beginning with the design and fabrication of new materials through their evaluation in the laboratory to their deployment in clinical setting.  To facilitate intramural investigations in demonstration projects, the NCI is seeking to contract with a nanofabrication facility to produce high quality biomaterials for engagement in focused cancer research.  Since NCI does not have a fabrication facility on campus or at its immediate disposal, they plan to acquire services that will enable custom fabrication of detection and delivery materials through a contract mechanism.  

To support this effort, staffing is necessary with a high degree of technical expertise and skills in biomaterials and fabrication techniques.  The contractor will provide design and engineering of biomaterials for the purposes of NCI sponsored intramural investigations.   The contractor will also provide the basis of training of NCI staff and contractors in fabrication skills, applications, principles of biomaterials, and provide additional context to overcoming barriers between the engineering and biological sciences.  

The contract with the host institution will provide support at the equivalent of two (2) full-time positions with the following background:

1)	Ph.D. in engineering, bioengineering, or materials sciences
2)	A minimum of 2 years post-graduate experience in applied graduate research in nanotechnology
3)	Skills, abilities, and talents to support independent fabrication of micro- and nano-materials, derived from silicon, metal-based, and viral or biological vectors. 
4)	Familiar with quality control, quality assurance procedures for production of nanoparticles
5)	Practices high level of safety in handling biological materials
6)	Familiar with principles of cancer detection and drug delivery systems
7)	Knowledge and expertise about the interactions of materials and biological systems (cells, DNA, protein, etc.). 

The contract will involve some travel (approximately 4 times a year) to Bethesda or Frederick, MD.  Each position will be required to be based full-time at the location of a fabrication facility that is contracted to the NCI or SAIC.  

The work conducted under this agreement precludes manufacturing of materials for the contractorís own use, commercialization by fabrication facility or to be provided to another or third party contractor.

The period of the contract is for one (1) year with an option to renew a second year.      

The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center is the only source known to be able to provide the services and personnel required to perform the work described above.  This is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow a full determination of the parties capability to fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 5:00 PM EST (local Washington, D.c. time) on 26 Nov 03.  If you have any questions, please contact Dennis Dougherty via electronic mail at ddougherty@ncifcrf.gov or by fax 301-228-4037.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The response date for this procurement is extended to 12-08-03. The following questions and answers are hereby provided for clarity and to ensure the integrity of the competitive process: (Q) We are interested in the ROC opportunity with EPA Region III (PR-R3-04-1008).  It is a total small business set aside.  Is this a 100% set aside? Partial set aside?  Can a contractor team up with small business to bid on this contract.  (A) This is a 100% small business set-aside.  However, contractors can team up with whomever they want.  Team contractors can either be small or large business.  However, if a team subcontractor is a large business, 51% of the work has to be completed by the small business members of the team.  From a competitive standpoint, if there is any area of expertise that your firm may not be that strong technically, it may be wise to consider partnering with other competent firms... (Q)Is there a webpage other than what you sent me and is on the FBO website that contains more information on what is being requested?  (A)No (Q)Is the address given for delivery the same for US Postal as well as overnight delivery services?  (A)Yes.  But, contractor's are responsible for getting their submission to EPA by the designated date and time. Just by sending the package overnight does not necessarily guarantee that EPA will have the submission at the designated date and time... (Q)Will fax responses be accepted?  If so, is there a fax number?  (A)Sure, but same applies as above. If the machine doesn't work in the last minute, the submittal is still going to be considered late.  (F)215-814-5211 (Q)Can responses be sent electronically?  (A)Electronic submissions are acceptable, but same applies as above.  If the machine doesn't work in the last minute, the submittal is still going to be considered late.  The following e-mail addresses should both be used: senderling.david@epa.gov and clark.jim@epa.gov (Q)How soon after December 8th will a COI Plan and QMP be required?  (A)Only the selected firm is required to submit these documents.  Submission is expected to be in the January or February 2004 time frame. (Q)Will all subcontractors have to supply an SF254 with the proposal or just the prime contractor?  (A)Yes.  All team subcontractors should be represented with the 254s and 255s. (Q)Can Block # 7 on SF255 for additional subcontractors be added on addendum sheets?  (A)Yes.  There is no reason contractor's can't use addendum sheets.  Qualifications should address the criteria. (Q)Can Block # 10 on SF255 be continued on addendum sheets?  (A)Yes.  There is no reason contractor's can't use addendum sheets.  Qualifications should address the criteria. (Q)Is there an incumbent or someone currently performing similar work?  If so, can you tell us who that is and contract number?  (A) The incumbent contractor is Techlaw, Contract #  68-W-00-108. (Q)Is this the first time this project is bid as stated? (A)This is the first time EPA will be using a PBSC SOW.  This is also the first time ROC will be placed and administered by a regional contracting officer. However, this is third generation of ROC for the Region.   (Q)Last award price? (A)It was a cost plus fixed fee contract for $3.7 million.  Approximately, $1.5 million has been spent to date.   (Q)Understand that you are the Point Of Contact for the ROC for Federal Facilities, FUDS or FUSRAP sites Region III-Small Business set aside.  Can you tell me if there is any other similar term contracts currently being advertised and/or considered for other regions? (A)There are other ROC contracts that will be awarded by EPA HQ at a later date.  Region III may be the only region placing their our own ROC.  Region III will be the first ROC awarded. Note, the Region III ROC will probably be the only award using the Brooks Act A-E procedures to place the award.  EPA HQ historically has used source selection procedures to place the ROC awards.  (Q)Please clarify the pre-award potential conflict of interest referenced in the above presolicitation.  Does it mean that a firm having an existing contract with a Federal agency (other than EPA) that covers the scope of services at federal facilities in EPA Region 3 is excluded from responding to this solicitation, or, is the COI based on a site-specific basis (i.e.,individual task orders).   (A) No. Contractors will not be excluded for performing on other federal facilities in Region III. Quite the contrary, EPA is seeking firms with experience for this ROC placement.  COI determinations will primarily be based on site specific basis. However, prior to issuing a work assignment/task order in post award, EPA will ensure that the contractor is objective by reviewing the appropriate information and answering these questions: 1.  Has the contractor performed work at the site for the federal facility or PRPs? 2. Has the contractor performed similar or related services for the federal facility or PRPs at other sites within the past 3 years? 3.  Has the contractor performed other services for the federal facility or PRPs within the past 3 years? 4. Does the contractor have financial relationships with the federal facility or PRPs and their respective affiliates, subsidiaries and parents? 5. Are there any other sensitive factors, visibility or management concerns? (Q)It seems that if the case is the former then small businesses with the requisite technical capabilities will be excluded. In particular, those firms that have sufficient FUSRAP, munitions (i.e., range and UXO) experience are the ones that likely have other Federal contracts.  I would appreciate some general guidance on this issue. (A) Region III concurs with this assessment, which is why the Limitation of Future Contracting (LOFC) clause is currently being amended. (Q) How many hard copies of the response package should we provide to EPA? (A) One is the minimum, but five copies would be helpful for review purposes.   (Q) Should we also include an electronic copy? (A) Not required.  (Q) Are there any limitations on number of pages, number of projects or number of resumes to be included in our response? (A) No (Q) In order to most clearly present the required information, it would be our typical practice to use color and graphical information in our response package.  Is such an approach acceptable? (A) Yes (Q) Will there be a Limitation of Future Contracting (LOFC) clause in the resulting contract?  If so, is it expected that the language will mirror the COI language included in the Notice? (A) See answer above.  The clause will be different. SUBJECT: R ? Regional Oversight Contract (ROC) for Federal facilities, FUDS, or FUSRAP sites in EPA Region III, which includes the states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.  POC: David Senderling, (P)215-814-5309, (F)215-814-5211, senderling.david@epa.gov  DESC: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires professional architect/engineer (A&E) services to support the Agency in its mission of oversight and enforcement of both Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) activities at sites located at active, closing, closed, or former Federal facilities, including a Formerly Used Defense Site (FUDS) or Formerly Used Site Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) site, and, to a lesser extent, non-Federal facilities within the geographic boundaries of EPA Region III.   	The Federal Facilities Compliance Act of 1992 waives sovereign immunity for Federal hazardous waste generators.  CERCLA ?120 and ?6001 delegate extensive oversight responsibilities to EPA for hazardous waste remediation projects at Federal facilities.  To fulfill these responsibilities, EPA reviews technical documents generated by the facility (or its contractor), approves remedies, oversees removals, assists in deliberations leading to agreements with other Federal agencies or non-Federal potentially responsible parties (PRPs), and determines appropriate penalties where necessary.  The successful offeror will be required to demonstrate competency in the following areas: technical document review; meeting support; field activities and data review; and technical support for such activities as CERCLA Site Assessments,  Remedial Investigations/ Feasibility Studies, Removals, Remedial Designs, post-Record of Decision (ROD) actions, community involvement and outreach, data management services, military munitions response services, radiation, and negotiations.        For purposes of this procurement, the Agency considers an offeror to have pre-award potential conflict of interest (COI) if the offeror currently holds a prime contract or subcontract with any party (other than EPA) for work related to CERCLA or RCRA activities, remedial planning or implementation, or reuse planning or development at sites located at an active, closing, closed, or former Federal facility within EPA Region III.  Any such potential conflict will be evaluated by EPA prior to award. 	This procurement is a small business set-aside using NAICs code 562910, Environmental Remediation Services (firms with 500 employees or less) and will result in the competitive award of one (1) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ)-type contract with a minimum guarantee of $10,000 and maximum of $4 miservices, with respect to cost control, quality of work, and schedule adherence.   	5.   Firm's geographic location and familiarity with the localities within EPA Region III. 	The selected firm will be required to submit a cost proposal, contract management plan, internal COI procedures, quality assurance plan, procedures for handling confidential business information, health and safety plan, and plan for delivering analytical services. In order to be awarded a contract, these must be deemed acceptable by EPA and agreement must be reached on a reasonable cost-plus-fixed-fee.  Prior to award, the contractor will also be required to have an acceptable accounting system that allows for segregation of costs.   	Firms interested in responding to this announcement are invited to submit completed SF 254s and 255s to the address shown below by 4:00 P.M. (Eastern) on December 3, 2003.  Forms must be RECEIVED at the EPA Region III office by the deadline; postmarks will not suffice.  This is not a Request for Proposal.

<DESC>IDAHO NATIONAL ENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL LABORATORY SEEKS INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS TO COMMERCIALIZE METHOD FOR CHROMIUM ANALYSIS.  Announcement:  Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), operated by Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC (BBWI) under contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) is soliciting a written indication of interest from industrial partners, capable of developing, manufacturing and selling kits, reagents or devices for the method of analysis of heavy metals, in particular chromium, which was developed jointly by scientists at Washington State University (WSU) and INEEL, who are interested in entering into a license or research and development agreement for the purpose of developing and commercializing a Method for Metal Analysis and Speciation and Biosensor technology. License terms will include an up-front licensing payment, minimum annual royalties and a running royalty based on a percentage of sales.  Research and development agreements will be under a standard CRADA arrangement with an option for licensing.  A description of the technology follows:  This Invention is a colorimetric method for determination of a metal, e.g., Cr(VI), in pure or mixed metal samples.  A simple modification also allows determination of the valence state of chromium, e.g., Cr(III) as well as Cr(VI).  Preliminary results show the method to be sensitive to about 0.5 ÏM (26 Ïg/L) for Cr(VI) and to about 2ÏM (104 Ïg/L) for Cr(III).  The technology could be adapted to rapid analysis kits, provide colorimetric analysis of column eluents and be adapted for simultaneous electronic measurement of multiple samples.  More details will be available to qualified companies under a nondisclosure agreement.  The successful company will be expected to seek approval of the method(s) by EPA.  Note: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Companies interested in commercializing WSU/BBWI's Method for Metal Analysis and Speciation and Biosensor should provide a written statement of interest which includes the following: 1) company name and address; 2) the name, address, telephone number and e-mail address for a point of contact; 3) a brief description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology; and 4) a brief description of how the company might commercialize this technology.  The statement of interest should be made by US mail or e-mail and should be received within 30 days of publication of this opportunity at the following address: John R. Snyder, Ph.D., Advisory Account Executive, Technology Transfer and Commercialization, BBWI, P.O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3805. E-mail is snydjr@inel.gov.

The Department of Justice exchanges high volumes of information with the United States Courts in the process of conducting litigation. Some of this information is currently exchanged electronically, using electronic case filing systems offered by the Courts. These systems change the business procedures and workflows for the fundamental business processes of creating, filing, receiving, accessing and managing litigation documents, resulting in an increased burden on Department of Justice personnel.
	The Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA) is tasked with developing an improved electronic case filing solution for the Department of Justice. In collaboration with other Department of Justice components that conduct litigation, EOUSA intends to develop a Concept of Operations for the Department of Justice Electronic Case Filing System  (ECFS).
Note: After receipt and review of the information obtained through this RFI, EOUSA intends to establish a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to document and analyze the current litigation filing business processes and develop a Concept of Operations for an information system to automate those business processes. EOUSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information provided in response to this RFI.

<DESC>NA The Army is interested in the design and development of novel imaging methods to display highly realistic, computer generated, three-dimensional (3D) holographic images for potential application in ground vehicle design/development.  Those 3D images should : 1) be visible and interactive without the use of human optical enhancements (3D glasses/goggles, tracking devices, etc.);  2) provide a unique and correct perspective for the viewer regardless of viewing position; and  3) maintain an effective high resol ution appearance of the displayed model (i.e., employ enough cameras, projectors, slices, mirrors, etc. so that the holographic image does not appear to jump when participants move their viewpoint or interact with the model).  These capabilities will be so ught for two particular laboratory locations:  1) replacement of an existing √¢¬Ä¬úPowerWall√¢¬Ä¬ù display with a vertical viewing area of 15 ft. wide by 7 ft. high.  Functionality of the proposed display must be integrated with the existing GFE multi-medi a components currently used in the facility; and 2) a larger display capability should be capable of projecting a holographic 3D image on a vertical display area of at least 20 ft. wide and 9 ft. high and a horizontal display area of approximately 8 ft. by  12 ft.  Both vertical and horizontal capabilities are required.  Any solutions should be capable of being demonstrated operationally in a room size that is approximately 35 ft. by 55 ft.  Any technology must be compatible with and be able to accept extern al computational and solid model data into the holographic image creation process, such as IGES, VRML and OpenGL formats.  A description (if new development is planned) or identification (if existing software will be used or modified) of the software that forms the computer-generated hologram is necessary.  Proposed solutions must address its inclusion in the current modeling environment which includes the use of Parametric Technology Corporation√¢¬Ä¬ôs application suite (Division, MockUp 2000i^2, ProE, Pro ductView, and WindChill) and Maya animation software.  Proposed solutions must address any graphical computational resources necessary to self-sufficiently run the display devices and how, if necessary, they will interconnect with any existing graphical su percomputing resources.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
              AIR FORCE MEDIATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES

                      Reference # F49642-03-R-XXXX

The Air Force Alternative Dispute Resolution Program (www.adr.af.mil) is requesting information for a potential acquisition to acquire dispute resolution services and support in several functional areas, at locations across the continental United States. The potential acquisition would be for approximately 100 mediation or mentoring sessions per year and ADR functional support.  Currently, Air Force military and civilian employees perform these services in conjunction with a Government contractor.

The overall purpose of the ADR Program is to promote the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques and processes to resolve disputes in appropriate cases. The Air Force recognizes the benefits in time and cost savings/avoidance through these measures as well as the intangible benefits received when disputes are settled in a faster, more appropriate, more amiable process than the traditional administrative or adjudicative options.

The Air Force seeks to promote the use of ADR to resolve disputes in which the Air Force is a party. To do so, its personnel must be made aware of what ADR is, what it offers them, how to initiate its use, how the different processes work, and which one(s) are appropriate for their situation. Furthermore, the Air Force seeks to train its personnel to screen cases for ADR, use as well as actually use the techniques and conduct the processes. While the Air Force educates its personnel about ADR and trains its people to conduct these processes, there is also a need to assist the Major Commands (MAJCOMs) in tailoring the overall program to meet their command specific requirements. This effort also requires a marketing effort to encourage all Air Force personnel at every level to consider using ADR to resolve their disputes should the need arise. 

Types of workplace disputes requiring mediation, mediation mentoring, and third party neutral services include the following:

Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Complaints,
Agency Grievances (AGS), 
Negotiated Grievances (NGS), 
Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) Complaints, 
Merit System Protection Board (MSPB) cases, and 
Disputes between Military Members deemed appropriate for resolution through the ADR process IAW AFI 36-2706 (as amended). 

The Air Force Alternative Dispute Resolution Program is divided into three functional areas: Management and Administration Support Services, ADR Program Support, and ADR Program Website. 

Request contractors interested and capable of performing these functions submit the following information: name and address of company, company point of contact, telephone number, fax number and email addresses, identify business size (small, disadvantage, HUBZone, women owned, 8(a), etc.) and identify if you are a GSA schedule holder. For purposes of this Request For Information (RFI), the SIC Code is 8741 and the corresponding NAICS code is 56111. The capability package must be clear, concise, complete, and submitted to the contracting office no later than 14 March 2003. Please limit the capability package to 25 pages. The packages can be submitted by US mail, e-mail or fax.

Your statement of capabilities must include, as a minimum, the following items: 1) Contract references in the past five years relevant to the requirement to include: contract number, agency supported, whether or not you were a prime or subcontractor, period of performance, original contract value, final or current contract value, technical monitor and phone/fax number, POC with current phone/fax number, and a brief description of the effort. 2) Company profile: number of employees, annual sales history, locations, and if CCR registered. 3) Your company?s ability to provide services in all three ADR Program functional areas.

Please indicate your company?s ability to provide ADR Program services and support in each functional area. Please indicate information in the following format: 

1) Management and Administration Services
a. Workplace mediation mentoring based on the Air Force standard mediation model 
b. Workplace mediation based on the Air Force standard mediation model 
c. Third party neutral services based on the Air Force standard mediation model
	d. ADR training courses as listed

<DESC>NA 1.0  Scope:  Provide maintenance stands for the AH-64, CH-47, and UH-60 platforms, featuring welded, high-strength, lightweight aluminum construction. The platforms should be easily rolled into place next to the helicopter and its height is adjustable to c ompensate for hanger floors that are uneven.  The maintenance platforms shall have internal plumbing for the ability to operate AVUM and AVIM air and electrical maintenance tools throughout the platform and capability to withstand the maximum allowable gro ss weight requirements to conduct unit and intermediate level maintenance.  Initial procurement is for six (6) AH-64 maintenance stands, seven (7) CH-47 maintenance stands, and four (4) UH-60 maintenance stands.  Anticipated delivery schedule is to be comp leted by July 2004. 1.1  Background:  Aviation Ground Support Equipment (AGSE) Project Manager (PM) is conducting a Request for Information (RFI) in response to an urgent requirement to support congressional plus-up for the procurement of aviation maintenance work platforms f or the Army National Guard (ARNG).  The information collected will serve as a foundation for a comprehensive review of aviation maintenance platforms.  The current family of maintenance stands/platforms is facing obsolescence problems.  Existing stands wer e procured during the late 60s and early 70s and were not designed to support the modern fleet of aircraft.  The result is a serious risk of falls, as maintainers must climb onto the aircraft during scheduled and unscheduled maintenance.  During the period  FY93 through FY02 the Army Safety Center identified 56 fall related accidents and as a result, the Army is moving toward aligning unit safety programs with Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) standards.  Existing stands do not fully comply with these standards, especially during the multi-area work associated with phase and major maintenance repair. 2.0 Acronyms: 2.1  OSHA:  Occupational Safety & Health Administration 2.2  DoD:  Department of Defense 2.3  AVUM:  Aviation Unit Level Maintenance 2.4  AVIM:  Aviation Intermediate Level Maintenance 2.5  GSA:  General Services Administration 3.0  Applicable Documents: 3.1  OSHA Reg 1910.23  Guarding floor and wall openings and holes 3.2  OSHA Reg 1910.26  Portable Metal Ladders 3.3  OSHA Reg 1910.27  Fixed ladders 3.4  OSHA Reg 1910.29  Manually propelled mobile ladder stands and scaffolds 3.5  OSHA Reg 1910.67  Vehicle mounted elevating and rotating work platforms 3.6  OSHA Reg 1910.305  Wiring methods, components, and equipment general use 4.0  General Information  Requested from Supplier: 4.1	Purchase descriptions used by other government activities 4.2	Weight or load bearing capacity of each stand 4.3  Average time between model changes and practice of providing continued parts inventories, upgrades, or production for phased out models 4.4  Plans for handling upgrades and obsolescence 4.5  Length of time the product has been produced  4.6  Product quality, reliability, and maintainability experience of similar users 4.7  List of products and company services satisfying identical or similar service requirements 4.8  Applicable regulatory and de facto standards used by the company 4.9  Compliant with OSHA regulations identified in sub-paragraph 3.1 through 3.6 4.10  Number of suppliers 4.11  Production capacity to meet requirements as part of sales 4.12  Packaging, handling, storage, and transportation practices 4.13  List of GSA schedules which contain these products  4.14  Delivery schedules  for each maintenance platform 4.15  Describe how initial set-up and customer training is accomplished and priced  5.0  Market Evaluation - Requested from Supplier: 5.1  Annual sales 5.2  Anticipated future orders 5.3  Warranty terms and practices, annual returns under warranty of similar items 5.4  Need for any pre-production or production qu alification testing and special quality assurance requirements 6.0  Supportability - Requested from Supplier: 6.1  Repair parts availability and lead times, documentation, and pricing (Are repair parts available within the DoD supply system or through GSA Schedule?) 6.2  Training packages currently utilized for set-up operations, training, and sustainment 6.3  Commercial repair capabilities 6.4  Calibration requirements 6.5  Supplier commitment to out-year support 6.6	Degree of technical data package availability 6.7	Availability of Technical Manuals and process for providing updates to customers 6.8  Additional tools and calibration requirements 7.0  References - Requested from Supplier: 7.1  List of those currently using the product 7.2  List of similar users currently using the product in the kinds of environments in which DoD operates 8.0  Operation characteristics: 8.1  Fixed base operations 9.0  Maintainability: 9.1  Organizational level support. 9.2  Operated by the 95th percentile soldier 10.0  Logistics Support: 10.1  Maintenance conducted at AVUM and AVIM level 10.2  Training conducted at unit level 10.3  Transportability:  Secondary load capability with current aviation AVUM and AVIM organic air and ground assets  12.0  Interested sources should submit their responses in writing, electronic submission preferred, no later that 31 DEC 03.

The Dual Use cooperative agreement opportunity described in this notice is one method of accomplishing this objective.  The purpose of the Dual Use program is to establish partnerships with commercial partners so the project has a goal of developing a commercial product, or application, as well as developing the technology to meet a NASA need. This goal will be accomplished by selecting partners who will cooperatively share in the development of the technology for an identified commercialization purpose while simultaneously developing the technology for the specified NASA need. 1.2   Scope This solicitation is seeking responses from commercial partners interested in entering into a cooperative agreement with NASA for the joint development of a Dual Use technology project.  It is published as NASA Cooperative Agreement Notice, CAN SSC-04-01 entitled "Dual Use Technology Development at NASA John C. Stennis Space Center".	The Dual Use projects are sponsored and managed by the Technology Development and Transfer Office (TDTO) at the John C. Stennis Space Center, Stennis Space Center (SSC), MS 39529-6000.  Proposals should be submitted in accordance with the instructions in this CAN and should meet the project requirements identified. The projects will be selected based on the criteria described in the following sections. NASA plans to fund up to six projects at approximately $20,000 to $75,000 per project with a period of performance of approximately 12 months. Projects are contingent upon availability of funds. The participating partner will contribute resources to match the NASA funding. The projects will be joint development efforts in the areas of rocket propulsion testing and earth system science that will include collaboration with NASA or NASA support contractor personnel.  NASA facilities may be available for use in the technology development and demonstration if needed and stipulated in the agreement. NASA will award cooperative agreements under the CAN in accordance with Section D of the NASA Grant and Cooperative Agreement Handbook.  The Handbook is available on the Internet at  http://ec.msfc.nasa.gov/hq/grcover.htm	. Under a CAN, the funding agency will have substantial involvement in, and contribution to, the technical aspects of the effort.	Cooperative Agreements differ from grant programs where there is no substantial involvement of the funding agency in monitoring the work or research program. This type of solicitation also allows contact with the potential technical resources at Stennis Space Center during the solicitation open period.   1.3   Partnership Principles In a cooperative agreement between NASA and a commercial firm, substantial resource contribution on the part of the Recipient is required.  The Recipient is expected to contribute at least 50 percent of the total resources required to accomplish the cooperative agreement.  Recipient contributions may be cash, non-cash or both.   Milestone billing is the method of payment to the Recipient under cooperative agreements.  Performance based milestones are used as the basis of establishing a set of verifiable milestones for payment purposes.  Each milestone payment shall be established so that the Government payment is at the same share ratio as the cooperative agreement share ratio.	The partner will establish the milestones necessary to accomplish the technology development.	These milestones will be identified in the proposal. NASA requires that the first Milestone be a project "kick-off" meeting between the partner and NASA. At a minimum, a brief status report will be required at completion of each milestone.  NASA also requires that the last Milestone be a project closeout briefing between NASA and all parties involved. The final milestone payment will not be made until all reporting requirements for the project have been submitted. 2.0  Project Requirements 2.1	  Technical Requirements The objective of Dual Use projects is to develop technologies for a commercial purpose while simultaneously meeting a NASA need.  All proposals must clearly identify the technical requirements for the NASA need at the John C. Stennis Space Center (SSC).  The main focus areas at SSC are Rocket Propulsion Testing and Earth Science Applications. Technical needs in the area of propulsion testing include, but are not limited to, development of a simpler, more reliable alternative to relief valves used in high-pressure systems including cryogenic systems. The repair and service for the current relief valves require significant time delays and costs. One potential alternative might be a rupture pin valve type of technology that could meet the severe operating parameter of the rocket test propulsion test environments.  There is also an interest is pursuing improved components, such as control and isolation valves, for use in 8500 to 15000 psig gas or liquid service. The improvements might be in the design of the valves or the manufacturability of the valves. The objective is components with improved reliability and maintainability at a lower cost that can be delivered with a reduced time for manufacture.  Areas of interest include 15,000 psig ball valves, with nominal 4" bore that are suitable for gaseous H2 service and capable for high delta pressure (dP) conditions with low leakage rates (Class 6 or better). Any design should have a life expectancy of years with minimal maintenance and the capability of disassembly for complete repair. Both uni-directional and bi-directional valve will be considered. Design for maintenance without removal of body from the piping system is of interest. Cryogenic service is an optional criteria but dual service use would be of special interest. The valve must be able to function without lubrication. Another area of interest is innovative actuation that is compatible for these types of ball valves operating under high dP. An additional interest is innovative design of, or design modification to current Stennis Y pattern 8500-10000 psig, cryogenic control valves to improve reliability and maintainability. Other technical needs in the area of propulsion testing include methods of identification and tracking of parts in mechanical system components. This tracking method should provide some form of permanent identification method such as bar-coding that can be applied to the various component parts that are commonly changed out during repair and servicing such as valve seals and other valve softgoods. The form of identification must be able to survive the severe cleaning methods and cryogenic service environment as well as be applied to small, complex surfaces and component softgood materials such as Teflon. In addition to the identification and tracking system, a scheduling software package is needed that will integrate the identification system into a task scheduling system that will schedule jobs with the flexibility to easily change the priorities of the tasks. Another opportunity in propulsion testing is an effort to develop a "real fluids' computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling capability using FDNS, CHEM, and/or STREAM, and incorporating those codes into the LOCI framework developed by Mississippi State University. The final product would be a state of the art CFD analysis system that uses accurate determinations of fluid properties. Technical needs in the area of earth sciences include, but are not limited to, development of a low cost fluorometric light source (FLS) that can be used for obtaining flow cytometric signatures.	This technology can be used for real-time biological decision support systems as well as ground truthing of remotely sensed data during development of Bio-GIS systems. Another earth science application of interest is a data query system that provides seamless access to multiple databases that permits the user to submit simultaneous queries to the different databases.  There is also an interest in a web-based, real-time distributed monitoring system that could link to multiple monitoring devices and provide a unique tool for emergency response and facility managers.   The development of Decision Support Systems (DSS) for environmental monitoring and impact assessment through the use of Geospatial hardware and software is another area of interest in Earth Science applications. A specific application for an environmental DSS would identify and assess the environmental locations and impact of failing septic tank systems. Another technology of interest would be a high-resolution smooth earth model using LIDAR and other satellite, aerial, and elevation data that would provide a complete high-resolution elevation model with no anomalies or null data values. In addition to addressing the NASA need, a project in these areas must also identify the commercial market potential of the technology. 2.2   Commercialization Requirements The second objective of Dual Use projects is the commercialization of the technology.  All proposals must contain a business plan, which includes a market feasibility study of the proposed technology, an estimate of financial resources required to commercialize the technology, and the strategy to produce and market the technology. 2.3 Reporting Requirements All proposals must contain provisions for reporting the progress and results of the Dual Use project to the Technology Development and Transfer Office (TDTO) and to the Technical Monitor.  The actual points of contact will be contained in the final negotiated agreement.  The content and frequency of the reports must be identified in the proposal. At a minimum, progress must be reported at each milestone and a final report detailing the results of the project. In addition, the reporting clauses in a cooperative agreement requires that any reportable technology or innovation developed during the partnership must be reported even though the Intellectual Property of any innovation may be retained by the partner. 3.0        Proposal Instructions for CAN 3.1       Proposal Submission Three (3) copies of the proposal should be submitted to NASA. An official authorized to certify company contribution, as well as, the management and financial aspects of the proposed project must sign the proposals.  All proposals should be sent to: NASA Acquisition Management Office/Code BA31 John C. Stennis Space Center Stennis Space Center, MS 39529-6000 This office must receive proposals no later than 3:00 PM on January 14, 2004. 3.2   Proposal Content and Format All proposals shall contain the following sections: 1) Technical Proposal section detailing the technical objectives and methods to be used in the project, 2) Business/Commercialization Plan section outlining the commercialization goals and processes, 3) Personnel and Facilities section describing the relevant experience of the key personnel and the facilities to be used in the execution of the project, and 4) Cost section containing both the expected NASA cost and the contributions of the company.

A work plan should be included that indicates what development effort will be performed, where it will be performed, and how it will be performed. The methods planned to achieve each objective or task should be discussed in detail. These task descriptions should be linked to the milestones defined for the payment schedule. 3.4	     Personnel and Facilities Plan Key personnel involved in the development activities will be identified in this section. Key personnel are the principal investigator and other individuals whose expertise and functions are essential to the success of the project. Provide biographic information including directly related education and experience.  Describe in detail any subcontracting, consultant, or other business arrangements. The offeror should identify and describe the relevant facilities and equipment currently available, and those to be purchased, to support the proposed activities. NASA strongly discourages funding the acquisition of equipment, instrumentation, or facilities. 3.5     Business/Commercialization Plan This section will describe plans for commercialization by identifying the contemplated commercial product and/or service and describe the corresponding commercial venture and the unique competitive advantage of both.	Provide a market feasibility study by identifying the target market and showing the distinction between U.S. Government and other markets with an estimated potential market size in terms of revenues to be realized by the offeror.  Show the strategic relevance of the project to the offeror with the proposed technology in terms of the offeror's current business segments, overall business plan, and relative position with respect to its competitors. Describe the amounts and sources of private financial resources expended and committed to date with respect to the technology development project and business development of the targeted commercial venture with evidence of the offeror's current financial strength. 3.6        Cost Plan The Cost Plan should contain a budget and co-funding plan that contains clear identification of cash requirements and contributions as well as the value of in-kind resources dedicated to accomplishing the project.  Under the terms of a cooperative agreement, the offeror is required to contribute at least 50% of the total resources required to accomplish the cooperative agreement.  This contribution can be in cash, non-cash, or a combination. The budget must be sufficient and reasonable to accomplish the project.  It must identify the costs for the milestones and final deliverables. It must also contain a clear co-funding plan for the use of NASA resources.  The Cost Plan should be prepared in accordance with the following guidelines and completed for each of the agreement years. The Plan shall include the resources requested from NASA. The costs for the project and the shared funding requirements of the Cost Plan should be reflected in a Table similar to that shown in Exhibit 3.6.1. The cost categories in the table should be based on the descriptions in the following sections.  Salaries and Wages:	The names of the Principal Investigator and other senior associates should be listed along with the estimated number of person months for which NASA funding is requested or cost sharing will be provided.  For other professionals and associates, each position must be listed, with the number of full time equivalent person months and rate of pay (hourly, monthly, or annual). For clerical, secretarial, supporting staff, etc., only the total numbers of persons and total amount of salaries per year in each category are required. Salaries requested must be consistent with the institution's regular practices. Cost Category  Total Per Cost Category NASA Funding Amount	   Cost Sharing Amount Salaries & Wages 		    Fringe Benefits			 Materials			 Other Direct			  Indirect (Overhead)			  Total     	      Exhibit 3.6.1:  Budget and Cost Sharing Requirements Breakdown Fringe Benefits: Contributions to employee (social security, retirement, etc.) may be treated as direct costs if that is the company's usual accounting practice. Materials:  Equipment purchases are discouraged, especially computing equipment. Equipment or materials costing $1,000 or more should be listed individually by description and estimated cost and adequately justified. Allowable items for NASA funding will be limited to equipment and apparatus that are not already available for the conduct of the work. General purpose office equipment will not be considered eligible for support.  NASA prefers that these items be a part of the proposer's cost sharing plan. Other Direct Costs: Travel  - Mode of travel, destination, number of days, perdiem, and relevance to the proposed activities should be specified. In order to qualify for support, attendance at meeting or conferences must directly contribute to specific project objectives. Allowance for air travel normally will not exceed the cost of round trip, economy air accommodations. Indirect Costs: The basis and rate for all indirect fees and costs, including overhead and general and administrative expenses must be within generally acceptable levels, conform to typical Federal grant and contract guidelines, and be clearly specified in the proposal. 3.7	    Schedule/Milestones The schedule section will define the development schedule with key milestones clearly identified on the schedule. Definitions of the key milestones should be included with task descriptions and assignments, resource allocations, and planned accomplishments in the Technical Proposal. The due dates for any identified deliverables, by either party of the agreement, will be shown on the schedule.  NASA requires that the first Milestone be a project "kick-off" meeting between the partner and NASA.  NASA also requires that the last Milestone be a project closeout briefing between NASA and all parties involved. 4.0	  Evaluation Factors The proposals will be evaluated on the following factors.  These factors will be weighted as follows:	      Factor			Weight (%) Technical Merit and Feasibility	60 Business/Commercialization Plan      20 Cost Realism 20      100 4.1 Factor: Technical Merit and Feasibility  The proposed project will be evaluated on whether it offers a feasible technical approach to a NASA problem or need. Specific objectives, approaches and plans for developing and verifying the innovation must demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and current state-of-the-art. The degree of understanding and significance of the risks involved in the proposed innovation must be presented.  The technical capabilities and experiences of the principal investigator or project manager, key personnel, staff, consultants and subcontractors, if any, will be evaluated for consistency with the research effort and their degree of commitment and availability. The necessary facilities required must be shown to be adequate and any reliance on external sources, such as Government Furnished Equipment or Facilities, addressed. The information used to evaluate this factor is to be included in the proposal as described in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 above. 4.2   Factor: Commercialization Plan The commercialization plan will be evaluated on the strength of the commercial potential of the technology. This includes the offeror's ability to identify a specific, well-defined commercial product or service based on the technology to be developed and a realistic target market niche of sufficient size with the potential for meeting a well-defined need within the target market niche. The evaluation will also consider the capability of the offeror to bring the remaining necessary private financial, physical, personnel and other resources to bear in a timely manner to achieve commercial application of the technology. In applying these commercial criteria, NASA will assess proposal information in terms of credibility, objectivity, reasonableness of key assumptions, independent corroborating evidence, internal consistency, demonstrated awareness of key risk areas and critical business vulnerabilities, and other indicators of sound business analysis and judgment.  4.3	    Factor: Cost Realism The cost plan will be evaluated to ensure that the proposed budget is sufficient and reasonable to accomplish the project.	The evaluation will assess whether there is clear identification of cash requirements and contributions as well as the value of in-kind resources dedicated to accomplishing the project. The evaluation will ensure the plan meets the terms of the cooperative agreement and that there is a contribution of at least 50% of the total resources required to accomplish the cooperative agreement whether in cash or in kind contributions.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposers' Day Announcement: Destructive Suppression of Enemy RF Telecommunications (DeSERT)
<DESC>PROPOSERSí DAY ANNOUNCEMENT:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agencyís (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) announces a Secret-Level Proposersí Day for the Destructive Suppression of Enemy RF Telecommunications (DeSERT) new start.  The goal of this Proposersí Day Conference is to discuss the goals of DeSERT, answer questions, and foster teaming among organizations to the extent practicable.  The objective of DeSERT is to develop enabling technologies for guided munitions capable of homing on enemy RF wireless communications.  The end goal would be a demonstration product in an existing 81mm mortar round form factor and that would be capable of:  1) receiving RF communications signals, 2) processing the received signal to determine the location of the emitter on the ground, and 3) maneuvering the mortar to a trajectory that ultimately will impact near the target emitter.  It is anticipated that a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will follow in the future.

The Proposersí Day Conference will be held on 4 December 2003 at the Executive Conference Center (ECC), 3601 Wilson Boulevard, Ste 600, Arlington, Virginia beginning at 8:30am and anticipated to last until noon.  Due to space limitations, each organization is welcome to send three people.  We suggest you send one each with technical, business, and contracting expertise.  If you wish to attend Proposersí Day, you must have an active Secret-Collateral clearance and register not later than 1 December 2003.  To initiate registration, send an e-mail to Jennifer Mozie (Jennifer_Mozie@sra.com) with your name, company name, e-mail address, phone number, and fax number.  After initiating registration, you must have your organizationís Security Officer fax your Secret-Collateral clearance to DARPA/ATO at (703) 516-7369 by 1 December 2003.  The fax cover sheet should include a remarks section that identifies your name and ìDeSERT Proposersí Day Registration and Clearance Information.î  Attendance at the Proposersí Day is voluntary.

After the conference, there will be an opportunity to meet individually with Dr. James Freebersyser.  These meetings will be only 15 minutes long and are intended to clarify questions you have on the program.  They are not for marketing proposals.  Please contact Jennifer Mozie of SRA Inc., Adroit C4ISR Center (Jennifer_Mozie@sra.com, (703) 647-1175) or Vic Jaroch of DPM Consulting, Inc.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation for this requirement.  Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is J04MR00001.  This is a full and open competition and will result in the award of a single firm fixed price contract.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 01-16 effective 10/31/2003.  STATEMENT OF NEED Introduction:  
The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), by mutual agreement with the United States Postal Service (USPS), owns a building located on land owned by the USPS, in Norton, Virginia.  The building was built in 1915 as a training center for the Bureau of Mines. The building has been vacant for many years and was used as a garage and storage area by MSHA.  The building is falling apart from neglect and is a  safety hazard.
MSHA and the USPS have agreed that the building should be demolished.  MSHA does not have further need for the facility nor does the USPS.  Remodeling the building is not a viable option, due to the buildings current condition, age, size, and market value.
