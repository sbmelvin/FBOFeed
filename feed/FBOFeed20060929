<CONTACT>BILL HOLBERT CONTRACT SPECIALIST 3034452448     bholbert@do.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for the following: Introduction: A jet grouting test section is planned for Mormon Island Auxiliary Dam (MIAD) located near Sacramento, California.  MIAD is an earthfill dam located approximately two miles east of Folsom Dam, which is part of the Central Valley Project.  MIAD is one component of Folsom Project which impounds the American River to form Folsom Lake.  MIAD was constructed by the United States Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) and was completed in 1953.  Upon completion of all project structures in 1956, operation and maintenance of the dams and dikes was assigned to the Bureau of Reclamation.  In the 1990s, MIAD foundation was modified upstream and downstream over a 900-foot wide section to limit seismic deformations.  The foundation was strengthened by the use of dynamic compaction along the upstream toe and the installation of bottom-feed stone columns downstream.   Additional seismic strengthening of the MIAD foundation soils in the downstream toe area is planned.  Jet grouting has been selected as the technically preferred alternative to treat the potentially liquefiable weak foundation soils in the downstream toe foundation.  These materials consist of dredger tailings and colluvium which consists of a wide range of types of materials with the predominant materials being sandy gravels.  The area of jet grouting will be in the same area which includes the previously installed stone columns. The purpose of the jet grouting test section at MIAD is to: 	1. Evaluate the feasibility of jet grouting for the foundation soils at MIAD 	2. Evaluate jet grouting technologies such as triple and double fluid systems 	3. Develop grouting parameters that can be used in final design 4.  Evaluate construction issues for final design such as waste handling, cement usage, and strength and quality of installed soilcrete Test Section:  The jet grouting test section at MIAD will consist of the installation of between 16-24 jet grout columns using triple fluid jet grouting technology and optionally, between 4-8 jet grout columns using double fluid jet grouting technology.  The jet grout columns will be installed a maximum of 80 feet in depth from an existing flat area at the downstream toe of MIAD.  The grout columns will be approximately 40 feet high and keyed into the underlying bedrock.  In preparation for the jet grouting work, the Contractor will be required to drill a continuous soil boring, near the proposed jet grout column array, in order to obtain samples to establish the geotechnical soil and bedrock properties of the site.  This borehole will be instrumented with vibrating wire piezometers and thermistors in order to monitor ground water elevations and temperature changes during jet grouting.  The Contractor will also be required to sample the grout mix and the spoil stream during grouting operations and create wet, molded samples for unconfined compressive strength testing.  In addition, the Contractor will be required to perform core drilling of the installed jet grout columns at specific locations, to retrieve in-place jet grouted soil cores for unconfined compressive strength testing, geometry determination, and quality control analysis.  The Contractor will also be required to monitor a number of jet grouting injection parameters for use in the evaluation of the quality and performance of the installed soilcrete columns. Production Jet Grouting:  It is anticipated that a contract to perform production jet grouting at MIAD will be issued and awarded in the fall of 2007 if the test section proves to be effective.  During production jet grouting, it is estimated that between 1,000 and 1,500 jet grout columns will be installed.   The RFP is expected to be issued on or about November 1, 2006, with a closing date approximately 30 days thereafter.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 237990 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.    Interested sources may access the Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 07SP811284 from the Fed Biz Ops website www.fbo.gov  when issued.   The award decision will be based upon a combination of price and technical factors which will be described in the RFP.

<DESC>This is a combine synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The solicitation number is RFP 765-6-6928-03.  This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12.  This is a small business Set-Aside.  The NAICS is 423430 with a business size standard of $42 million.

Background

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has a requirement for hardware, software, and services under its three-zone standardization architecture.  This Three Zone Architecture (Internet Architecture) uses Sun Microsystems Servers in a secure and robust manner.  The following applications is written for the Three Zone Architecture - - MODS (Medicare Ombudsmen Data Systems), expansion of enterprise service such as Extract, Transform Load (ETL) using Informatica.  

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is the largest insurance company in the world.  CMS expends $500 billion annually providing for more then 80 million beneficiaries while processing 1 billion claims annually.  CMS manages more than 1/3 of the nation?s healthcare expenditures, which amount to 5% of the nation?s GDP .
In an effort to streamline the CMS Information Technology Services, CMS is implementing IT standards that will reduce overall IT cost, and reduce the number of systems that it manages on a daily basis.  The Information Technology Modernization Group (ITMG) is responsible for the implementation of many of these standards, and to this end ITMG is committed to providing hardware, software, policies and procedures that are standardized on proven technology and industry best practices.

CMS has started down the path of standardization through the publication of major approved architecture documents such as the Internet Architecture, Web-Enable Application Architecture, Enterprise Messaging Architecture, and Application Developers Guide.  Through the use of these documents, policies, and industry best practices, CMS will standardize on these architectures.  Standards, however, are only as good as the policies and procedures that back them up, and thus, specific requirements must be developed to ensure that hardware and software meet these standards.  CMS has adopted a policy statement that Sun Solaris will be the standard Operating System for future business application development through the use of J2EE.  Thus, one of the major Operating System specifications that is now part of the CMS Technical Reference Manual (TRM) is Sun Solaris running on Sun Microsystems Servers.  
Using these policies, procedures, guides, and statements of future direction, CMS has designed and will be adding additional capacity through this procurement, to the Three Zone Architecture using Sun Microsystems Mid range and Enterprise Servers.  The Three Zone Architecture originally designed for Internet application has now been expanded into four (4) unique environments, Production Internet, ExtraNet, Test & Validation and Development.  The purpose of the Three Zone Architecture is to provide physical and logical separation of the Presentation (DMZ Region), Application (Application Region), and Data (Secure Region).  Through the use of firewalls and other security measures, the integrity of the information contained within each Zone (Region) will be safeguarded.  The approved CMS Architecture documents are available at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/it/enterprisearchitecture .

CMS continues to expand its Medicare & Medicaid Business Computing Environment (MMBCE) using the Three Zone Architecture established over the past thirty months based on Sun Microsystems Inc hardware and software to meet the continual demands for resources by our business partners and stakeholders.  This acquisition will acquire additional Sun Hardware, Software, Maintenance and Client Solution Services to meet Congressionally-mandated workloads.  CMS has been very successful in meeting previous demands and has successfully implemented over 20 applications within the past year.  This acquisition will procure Storage Area Network hardware and software, Sun Fire Servers, additional Disk Storage, and components to expand the CMS MMBCE.  As CMS has implemented many Medicare Modernization Act applications over the past year there are still more Medicare and Medicaid Business Applications coming to the MMBCE.  With such mission critical applications being implemented on this hardware and all of the inter-dependencies in hardware, software and operating systems CMS requires that an authorize Sun Microsystems company provide the hardware, software, and services for the expansion of the Sun Microsystems environment specified below.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is soliciting proposals for a five-year (three years with one two-year extension option) reimbursable contract to establish an Innovations Clearinghouse that will be a database-driven, Internet-accessible, public clearinghouse of innovations in health service delivery. The Innovations Clearinghouse will facilitate collection of innovative health service practices and present them in a standardized format accompanied by expert commentary; promote their dissemination, replication, adaptation, and use; and, foster innovation in the U.S. health care service industry. 

Tasks will revolve around the development, deployment and maintenance of the processes and systems to collect, publish, update and archive innovations (in health service delivery), associated tools and lessons learned. The innovations will be entered and stored in a Contractor-constructed database; they will be posted to a Web site the Contractor will design, deploy and maintain for this project. Related tasks include establishment of an expert panel and an editorial board, development of criteria that innovative health service delivery practices must meet to be included in the Clearinghouse, and creation of a standardized template to capture innovations attributes. The expert panel will guide the Clearinghouse on broad project areas, and will participate in approval of the inclusion criteria and standardized template. The Web site will be user-centered and will meet requirements of the E-Government Act of 2002, including ensuring information quality, following Department-wide policies, communicating with the public and following the Paperwork Reduction Act, using an approved domain, implementing security controls, protecting privacy, maintaining accessibility, and managing records. In addition, online and offline opportunities for learning and networking among Innovations Clearinghouse users will be a component of this project. AHRQs QualityTools database and Web site (www.qualitytools.ahrq.gov) will become the responsibility of the Innovations Clearinghouse Contractor.  Eventually, the QualityTools database will be presented through the Innovations Clearinghouse Web site. 

Offerors must possess expertise in health service delivery innovation and change; implementation of evidence-based health practices; health care quality improvement or disparities reduction strategy implementation and evaluation; complex database and government Web-site development and maintenance; and, working with expert panels and editorial boards. To evaluate the Offerors expertise in the aforementioned areas, the information on the process to perform the work described below must be included in the proposal.  1.  Maintain AHRQs QualityTools database and Web site.  2. Establish a project expert panel that will provide feedback and guidance, and to establish an editorial board with capacity to review submissions and write expert commentary critiquing innovation successes and failures, offering insights and addressing the nuances of innovation, implementation, and change.  3. Develop and apply inclusion criteria related to health service delivery innovations.  4. Develop an innovations database template record; Stimulate, assist in generating, and collect a comprehensive accumulation of health service delivery innovations and lessons learned. 6.  Stimulate, assist in generating, and collecting a comprehensive accumulation of health service delivery innovations and lessons learned. 7.  Design the Innovations Clearinghouse Web site incorporating feedback provided on the existing QualityTools Web site, and develop, test, deploy, maintain, and evaluate this national Web-based repository of health care system and practice innovations, change initiatives, change packages, and associated tools and lessons learned; import QualityTools Web crawler feature with a redesigned interface to assist users in finding relevant innovations, change initiatives, packages and tools at specific, complementary Web sites for one stop searching (or suggest an alternative Web crawler accompanied by rationale). 7. Emphasize innovations targeting public health priority diseases/conditions, priority populations, and efforts to reduce disparities in quality. 8.  Provide appropriate and timely technical assistance to users; and 9.  Provide dynamic opportunities for learning and networking among the users of the Web site 

The Innovations Clearinghouse is to be comprised of core staff of seasoned professionals with education and experience in areas such as operationalizing health service delivery innovation and change; implementing and evaluating health care quality improvement or disparities reduction strategies; educating and training adult professionals; evaluating and implementing evidence-based clinical information; constructing large relational databases; developing clinically-related classification schemes; and developing Web sites. A PMI-certified or PMI-certification eligible Project Manager is required as well as demonstrated ability to provide EVM information. In the event that the Innovations Clearinghouse core staff does not include particular expertise needed to accomplish a particular task, the Innovations Clearinghouse is to obtain such expertise through consultants and/or subcontracts.    

In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQs site at http://ahrq.gov . Once in AHRQs homepage go to Funding Opportunities, then to Contracts, and then to Request for Proposal (RFP). It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and to monitor this site for any subsequent amendments. It is estimated that the solicitation will be issued on/about May 19, 2006 with proposals due July 25, 2006.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 06-47 Quantum Sensors 
CLOSING DATE: One year from the date of publication in www.fbo.gov and www.grants.gov;  PROPOSALS FOR FIRST SELECTIONS DUE: 4:00 PM (Arlington VA local time), November 22nd 2006.  It is anticipated that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the first selections.  Full proposals must be submitted to DARPA, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA06-47).  POC: Dr. Michael Zatman, DARPA/STO; Email: quantum@darpa.mil;  Website: https://dtsn.darpa.mil/qsp.  (Note:  Those offerors that are proposing efforts under Grant instruments may alternately submit full proposals through www.grants.gov).

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency?s (DARPA) Strategic Technology Office (STO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for the Quantum Sensors Program (QSP).  The objective of QSP is to develop practical  sensors operating outside of a controlled laboratory environment that exploit non-classical photon states (e.g. entangled, squeezed, or cat) to surpass classical sensor resolution.

The Government encourages responses to this BAA by non-traditional defense contractors, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, small businesses, small disadvantaged business concerns, Historically-Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), large businesses and Government laboratories.  Teaming arrangements between and among these groups are encouraged.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for organizations of a specific business classification due to the impracticality of preserving discrete or severable areas of research in the technologies sought.  Government/National laboratory proposals may be subject to applicable direct competition limitations, though certain Federally Funded Research and Development Centers are excepted per PL 103-337 ? 217 and PL 105-261 ? 3136.  Any responsible and otherwise qualified offeror is encouraged to respond.

This BAA affords proposers the choice of submitting proposals for the award of a Grant, Cooperative Agreement, Contract, Technology Investment Agreement, or such other appropriate award instrument.  The type of procurement or assistance vehicle is subject to negotiation.  

The Government intends to issue awards based on the optimum combination of proposals that offers the best overall value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussion.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  The Government also reserves the right to select for award some portion(s) of the proposals received; in that event, the Government may select for negotiation all, or portions, of a given proposal.  The Government may incrementally fund any award issued under this BAA.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  The criteria to be used to evaluate and select proposals for this Program are (of equal importance):  (a) Scientific Merit;  (b) Innovation;  (c) Technical Qualifications and Management; (d) Cost Realism and Reasonableness; (e) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the DARPA Mission

SECURITY:  The Government anticipates the proposals submitted under this BAA will be UNCLASSIFIED.  Submission of classified proposals requires prior instructions and approval from DARPA as well as approval from the classifying agency.

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:  Additional information regarding program objectives, anticipated schedule, technical milestone criteria, and proposal preparation and submittal is provided in the PIP (Proposer Information Pamphlet) associated with this BAA.  Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA may access the PIP www.fbo.gov and www.grants.gov, by emailing a request to quantum@darpa.mil, or by visiting the Quantum Sensors Program web site at https://dtsn.darpa.mil/qsp.

NOTE:  Do not contact the contracting officer identified below with respect to this announcement.  All questions should be sent to quantum@darpa.mil.

<DESC>1.  The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), Special Projects Directorate at Lackland AFB, TX is soliciting your comments in response to several questions below.  This RFI is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. 2.  CPSG is developing a new generation of TT&C cryptographic devices to meet the needs of national security space programs and the Cryptographic Modernization (CM) program.  These new devices will be used to protect satellite and ground station command uplinks and telemetry downlinks from disruption or exploitation by non-authorized parties.   The Cryptologic Systems Group's Special Projects Directorate (CPSG/ZJ) is the developing program office assigned with the task of acquiring these cryptographic devices to support the modernization of Space TT&C for both satellite and ground control stations.  3.  CPSG intends to award a single contract to modify an existing Crypto-Modernized terrestrial re-programmable COMSEC product, with options for production and software maintenance and support.  This modified COMSEC product will be used to replace existing/legacy Ground Operating Equipment (GOE) as well as a near term solution for new satellite ground stations.  The modified End Cryptographic Unit (ECU) will replace legacy GOE that implements the KG 28/46, KG-29/57, KI-23, CARDHOLDER, and BELSHAZZAR algorithms.  In order to meet the requirement of new ground stations the ECU will need to provide higher data rates and modern cryptographic features.  The final ECU will be NSA Type 1 certified.  4.

<DESC>Contracting Point of Contact: Rhoda Parker, Contract Specialist, 505-853-7282; Technical Point of Contact: MSgt Steven Bible, 505-846-4749. The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy (DE) Contracting Directorate on behalf of the AFRL DE, Kirtland AFB, NM intends to award a sole source contract in accordance with FAR subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii)(A) to Twister B.V. for a supersonic COIL gas/liquid separator for AFRL/DELC at Kirtland AFB, NM. The contemplated effort is to obtain a 6 month contract with an approximate value of $400,000.
BACKGROUND: AFRL/DELC is developing and testing radical new designs for singlet oxygen generators for Chemical Oxygen Iodine Lasers (COIL). A design for a gas/liquid separator would remove the bulk liquid from the gas stream and should also remove a significant portion of vapor phase water, and minimize the residence time of the gas flow through the separator by accelerating the gas to supersonic velocities. Twister B.V. under a cooperative agreement through European Office of Aerospace Research and Development (EOARD) provided a modified a supersonic COIL gas/liquid separator. This contract would further modify the COIL to fit AFRL/DELC technical objectives.
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS are as follows: 1) A design for a gas/liquid separator will be optimized using fluid dynamics design codes; 2) The interaction of the mechanical design and the fluid dynamics will be investigated. This will include damping (if required), structural supports, tolerances and dimension (required for machining feasibility); 3) engineering calculations will be performed for all components which are pressurized based upon design pressure, dynamic loads and temperatures; 4) Based upon the optimized design, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations will be performed including all mechanical/machining constraints. The contractor shall deliver conceptual design package which contains all required information to allow AFRL/DELC to develop fabrication drawings. This package shall contain all details necessary to allow for a mechanical designer to create fabrication drawings. A contract will be issued to Twister B.V. provided other sources cannot provide the drawings at equal or better technical capability within the same time-frame as Twister B.V. Respondents are required to provide a statement of capability containing pertinent and specific information addressing the following areas: 1. Experience: An outline of projects previously performed relevant to the subject areas. 2.

<DESC>The National Institute on Drug Abuse is soliciting proposals from qualified individuals or organizations having the capability to act as a centralized repository for compounds from domestic and international investigators, commercial sources, and pharmaceutical companies.  The contract shall involve the receipt, purchase, storage and analysis of compounds from various sources, and the shipment of these compounds to domestic and international test sites, as well as maintenance of an extensive inventory and tracking system. The major goal of this project is to provide NIDA with a holding site which has the capability to inventory, analyze and store compounds, prepared under both non-GMP and GMP conditions, in amounts ranging from milligram quantities to several kilograms.  Because some compounds may be scheduled under the Controlled Substances Act, proper DEA registration and adequate security is required. All studies must be carried out under pertinent FDA regulations, such as current Good Clinical Practice (cGCP) and current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) regulations. To handle substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, DEA Research Registration for Schedules II to V will be required.  NIDA may also require a DEA registration for Schedule I controlled substances. The pertinent FDA's guidelines/guidance shall be followed.  It is estimated that a five year incrementally funded completion type contract with additional option quantities will be awarded. RFP No.  N01DA-7-8873 will be available electronically on or about October 23, 2006.  You can access the RFP through the FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov or through the NIDA website at the following address: http://www.nida.nih.gov/RFP/RFPList.html. The electronic RFP contains all information needed to submit a proposal. No printed version of the solicitation document or source list is available. NIDA will consider proposals submitted by any responsible offeror. Proposals will be due on or about December 7, 2006. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. See note 26.

PROJECT LOCATIONS: The primary area of project work and task orders will be located throughout Yellowstone National Park. In addition, contract(s) shall allow for issuance of individual task orders for projects within areas administered by the NPS in the states of Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, and Utah.                              ORGANIZATION: The lead firm(s) selected for contract award will be predominately Civil, Environmental and Sanitary design firm(s) as the majority of services to be performed under this contract(s) will be Civil/Environmental/Sanitary in nature. In order to maximize competition, the NPS is encouraging joint venture arrangements as well as prime/subcontractor relationships for this solicitation.               REQUIRED DISCIPLINES: Required disciplines include professionals registered as Civil Engineers, Traffic Engineers, and Environmental/Sanitary Engineers. Subconsultant disciplines, which may be required for some projects include professionals registered in structural, electrical, mechanical, hydrologic, fire/safety, and process/instrumentation engineering; surveyors; geotechnical engineering; architecture; landscape architecture; construction management and cost control/estimating. Environmental assessment personnel may coincide with other professionals previously listed and also may include subject matter experts in the resources affected by the action.  Incidental services, e.g. AutoCAD drafting, word processing, cost estimating, etc., may be required in the performance of specific task order requirements.                SUSTAINABLE DESIGN: The NPS has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects. By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operations of facilities.                                            REGISTRATION / LICENSING: Where applicable, the listed disciplines shall be licensed / registered to practice in the state in which the project is located. The facilities in Yellowstone National Park are located in the states of Wyoming and Montana. At the time of contract award the disciplines shall be or shall hold reciprocity eligibility to become licensed to practice in the states identified above.  In addition where applicable the listed disciplines shall meet the Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualification Standards. At least one person within the disciplines on the A/E's team shall be a LEED accredited professional.               PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: Periods of Performance shall be noted in each individual task order. Period of Performances may extend over several fiscal years.               REGULATIONS: The A/E shall be responsible for compliance with all federal, state and local regulations, codes and policies.               SUBCONSULTANTS: In the course of doing business with A/E firms under contract with the NPS, the NPS occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract. In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor. Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, the NPS will ensure that the prime is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime. The prime shall not be granted an administrative handling or coordination fee on subconsultant's services.                                                                                                                                                                         SELECTION / EVALUATION / AWARD PROCESS:               SELECTION PROCESS: A/E selection and award will be completed in three phases as follows:               Phase I:  a)  Interested firms shall submit their qualifications to perform the services noted above.  b)  An NPS evaluation panel will evaluate each company's qualifications in terms of the evaluation criteria noted below.  Based upon their evaluations the panel will select a minimum of three firms for interviews.                Phase II:  a)  An interview will be conducted with each of the firms selected in Phase I. During the interview the A/E teams shall present their qualifications. Presentations shall address each the evaluation criteria.  b)  Based upon all information obtained the evaluation panel will provide to the Contracting Officer a final selection list which states in order of preference three firms considered most highly qualified to perform the work.               Phase III:  a)	The Contracting Officer will issue a Request for Proposal to the highest ranked A/E firm.  b)  The A/E firm shall prepare and submit a proposal to the NPS. The proposal shall include unit pricing for the stated services as well as a subcontracting plan if applicable.  c)  The NPS and the A/E firm shall attempt to negotiate a mutually satisfactory contract. If a contract cannot be negotiated, the contracting officer shall initiate negotiations with the next firm on the final selection list. This procedure shall be continued until a mutually satisfactory contract has been negotiated.               EVALUATION CRITERIA: Evaluation and selection of the firm will be based on the following evaluation criteria, listed in descending order of importance:               1)  Demonstrated professional qualifications, professional registration, technical expertise, and experience of the firm, including all principles and key staff of the firm, its consultants, and project personnel, with projects of types described both in urban and remote locations. Emphasis will focus on familiarity with and project experience in applying principles of sustainability in climatic regions such as high mountains, and heavy snow areas, for the types of projects described.

The demonstration will examine the capabilities of the individual Advanced Technology Carry-on Screening Systems. Each vendor may participate in the trial and will retain ownership of their Advanced Technology Carry-on Screening System for the duration of the demonstration. 

The focus of this capabilities demonstration is to evaluate technologies and systems designed to screen carry-on baggage at aviation checkpoints.  The goal is to provide the TSA access to a variety of potential technologies and systems for evaluation.  

Vendors are requested to submit white papers to the TSA to determine capability.  The TSA intends to proceed as follows:

?	Solicitation of white papers by this RFI. 
?	Based on the evaluation of white papers received, the TSA will identify eligible vendors. As described above, eligible vendors will be requested to provide one unit to the TSA for a period of up to five days for demonstration and evaluation purposes. The unit will ship and install the unit at the lab located at the TSA Headquarters in Arlington, Va.
?	At the conclusion of demonstration, the unit will be returned to the vendor.

In order for systems to be eligible for submission for demonstration, vendors must supply proof of compliance with 21CFR1020.40.  Vendors must also successfully complete independent radiological safety testing at their own expense to meet ANSI N43.17, and must provide the laboratory results or certification.  Radiological safety testing must be conducted on a unit that is representative of the final design as evidenced in the Test Certifications that will be submitted.


 
Requirements

The Advanced Technology Carry-on Screening System shall provide the capability to visually locate and identify potential threats within carry-on baggage and divestment bins.  The Advanced Technology Carry-on Screening System must be capable of being integrated into the checkpoint environment.  The system will be used to differentiate metallic, non-metallic, and organic substances, and to aid in discriminating threat items.  

The Advanced Technology Carry-on Screening System may include options beyond the currently fielded X-Ray equipment which provide two-dimensional top-down view. These options should provide the user with additional information to help differentiate between threats and non-threats. 

The Advanced Technology Carry-on Screening System must currently have the ability to locate and identify potential metallic threats.  In addition, the system must have the capability to detect explosive compounds or must be upgradeable to implement this functionality.

The Advanced Technology Carry-on Screening System must currently incorporate, or be upgradeable to include, a training subsystem that can test users on their ability to discern threats from non-threats by superimposing threat images onto screened items.


Submission Requirements for RFI

Vendors may submit a single white paper for one or more systems that fit the criteria listed above.  Submitted white papers shall provide the following information:

?	Written commitment to provide radiological safety testing by a qualified independent laboratory.  Failure to provide proof of certification will result in immediate disqualification from further participation.
?	Certification of the ability to provide one demonstration unit to the TSA at no cost within 15 days of authorization to submit.
?	Written statement that the vendor can provide the services described in this RFI.
?	System dimensions (size, weight, height, and floor-loading in kilograms per square meter) and a listing of major end-item components.  TSA aviation checkpoint maximum size requirements are as follows: the footprint shall not exceed 1 meter by 3 meters; the height shall not exceed 2 meters; and the weight shall not exceed 650kg/m2.  Units that do not conform to these size limitations will not be considered for testing.

Misrepresentation or inability to meet the requirements stated in this RFI will be cause for immediate disqualification from any further participation in the TSA Advanced Technology Carry-on Screening Systems program.


 
Response Format and Due Date

Written responses are required.  Responses shall be prepared using 12 point font and shall not exceed 4 pages in length (including all data displays, charts, graphs, and tables).  The due date for receipt of responses to this RFI is 4:30 pm EST, October 6th, 2006.

This action supports informational objectives and in no way binds the Government to a contract at this time or in the future.  The Government will not assume any liability during testing and will not be responsible for any costs incurred by the vendor.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The US Army Space and Missile Defense Command supports an Army Science and Technology program to design, fabricate, integrate and test a High Energy Laser Technology Demonstrator (HEL TD).  The HEL TD program goal is to demonstrate at the High Energy  Laser Systems Test Facility, NM that all enabling technologies are sufficiently mature for a mobile solid state laser (SSL) weapon system to provide an effective counter rocket, artillery, and mortar (C-RAM) capability.  The HEL TD program will support th e transition to an Army acquisition program (Milestone B).   The HEL TD program is divided into three phases. Under Phase I, which will be full and open competition, SMDC will award one or more basic contracts for a preliminary design of a ruggedized Beam Control Subsystem (BCS) to be completed in FY08.  At that poi nt the Army may initiate Phase II by exercising priced options to the HEL TD contract(s).  One option would complete the design, fabrication, and testing of a ruggedized BCS and integration onto a tactical vehicle platform.  Another option would complete t he system engineering (SE) activities through a System Functional Review of the entire HEL TD system that accommodates multiple SSL designs.  During the performance period of the SE option, the government may contract to complete the development and testin g of the HEL TD system under a separate Phase III acquisition.  Phase III will include the efforts to ruggedize the SSL selected by the government; and the design, fabrication, integration, and testing of the entire HEL TD system.  This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  The proposed acquisition may involve a potential conflict of interest as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 9.5.   Issuance of Draft RFP W9113M-06-R-0018 is projected to occur within the next 30 days.  Written questions and comments regarding this Draft RFP are due no later than 14 days after the Draft RFP is issued.  Potential offerors are requested to attend an Indus try Roundtable Discussion meeting to be held in Huntsville, Alabama about 20 days after Draft RFP issuance.  The government will respond orally to questions at the Roundtable Discussion and encourages dialogue that could enhance the Final RFP.  In order to  assist potential offerors in evaluating design reference missions included in the draft HEL TD Performance Specification, information will be provided at a classified Lethality and Signature Database Workshop to be held the following day after the Roundta ble Discussions.  Participation at this Workshop requires all attendees to have a SECRET clearance on file at SMDC, Huntsville.  Classified material will be mailed to Workshop participants following the meeting.  Personnel attendance limitations and other special instructions will be stipulated in the Draft RFP.    Please note that this Draft RFP will also require that all candidate HEL TD high power SSL subsystem providers complete a table entitled SSL Black Box Interface Specifications for their specific SSL concept.  These completed tables will be included in the Final RFP.   Additional information, as well as the Draft and Final RFP when released, will be available at the SMDC website, http:www.smdc.army.mil/Contracts/Contracts.html.  For Official Use Only information, such as the draft HEL TD Performance Specification, will b e posted simultaneously with the Draft RFP release to a limited access AKO website. Interested contractors should provide their army.mil account address to Sharon Corbin (sharon.corbin@smdc.army.mil).

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is soliciting proposals for a five-year (three years with one two-year extension option) reimbursable contract to establish an Innovations Clearinghouse that will be a database-driven, Internet-accessible, public clearinghouse of innovations in health service delivery. The Innovations Clearinghouse will facilitate collection of innovative health service practices and present them in a standardized format accompanied by expert commentary; promote their dissemination, replication, adaptation, and use; and, foster innovation in the U.S. health care service industry. 

Tasks will revolve around the development, deployment and maintenance of the processes and systems to collect, publish, update and archive innovations (in health service delivery), associated tools and lessons learned. The innovations will be entered and stored in a Contractor-constructed database; they will be posted to a Web site the Contractor will design, deploy and maintain for this project. Related tasks include establishment of an expert panel and an editorial board, development of criteria that innovative health service delivery practices must meet to be included in the Clearinghouse, and creation of a standardized template to capture innovations attributes. The expert panel will guide the Clearinghouse on broad project areas, and will participate in approval of the inclusion criteria and standardized template. The Web site will be user-centered and will meet requirements of the E-Government Act of 2002, including ensuring information quality, following Department-wide policies, communicating with the public and following the Paperwork Reduction Act, using an approved domain, implementing security controls, protecting privacy, maintaining accessibility, and managing records. In addition, online and offline opportunities for learning and networking among Innovations Clearinghouse users will be a component of this project. AHRQs QualityTools database and Web site (www.qualitytools.ahrq.gov) will become the responsibility of the Innovations Clearinghouse Contractor.  Eventually, the QualityTools database will be presented through the Innovations Clearinghouse Web site. 

Offerors must possess expertise in health service delivery innovation and change; implementation of evidence-based health practices; health care quality improvement or disparities reduction strategy implementation and evaluation; complex database and government Web-site development and maintenance; and, working with expert panels and editorial boards. To evaluate the Offerors expertise in the aforementioned areas, the information on the process to perform the work described below must be included in the proposal.  1.  Maintain AHRQs QualityTools database and Web site.  2. Establish a project expert panel that will provide feedback and guidance, and to establish an editorial board with capacity to review submissions and write expert commentary critiquing innovation successes and failures, offering insights and addressing the nuances of innovation, implementation, and change.  3. Develop and apply inclusion criteria related to health service delivery innovations.  4. Develop an innovations database template record; Stimulate, assist in generating, and collect a comprehensive accumulation of health service delivery innovations and lessons learned. 6.  Stimulate, assist in generating, and collecting a comprehensive accumulation of health service delivery innovations and lessons learned. 7.  Design the Innovations Clearinghouse Web site incorporating feedback provided on the existing QualityTools Web site, and develop, test, deploy, maintain, and evaluate this national Web-based repository of health care system and practice innovations, change initiatives, change packages, and associated tools and lessons learned; import QualityTools Web crawler feature with a redesigned interface to assist users in finding relevant innovations, change initiatives, packages and tools at specific, complementary Web sites for one stop searching (or suggest an alternative Web crawler accompanied by rationale). 7. Emphasize innovations targeting public health priority diseases/conditions, priority populations, and efforts to reduce disparities in quality. 8.  Provide appropriate and timely technical assistance to users; and 9.  Provide dynamic opportunities for learning and networking among the users of the Web site 

The Innovations Clearinghouse is to be comprised of core staff of seasoned professionals with education and experience in areas such as operationalizing health service delivery innovation and change; implementing and evaluating health care quality improvement or disparities reduction strategies; educating and training adult professionals; evaluating and implementing evidence-based clinical information; constructing large relational databases; developing clinically-related classification schemes; and developing Web sites. A PMI-certified or PMI-certification eligible Project Manager is required as well as demonstrated ability to provide EVM information. In the event that the Innovations Clearinghouse core staff does not include particular expertise needed to accomplish a particular task, the Innovations Clearinghouse is to obtain such expertise through consultants and/or subcontracts.    

In addition to the solicitation being available on this site, it will be available for downloading from the internet on AHRQs site at http://ahrq.gov . Once in AHRQs homepage go to Funding Opportunities, then to Contracts, and then to Request for Proposal (RFP). It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for release of the solicitation, download their own copy of the solicitation, and to monitor this site for any subsequent amendments.

Description
The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).     We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 July 2007.

BACKGROUND

GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) as the prime contractor.     RAC is currently providing GBTS CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.     The GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the maximum student and instructor training load at each training site. The GBTS has three major functional areas:     Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).

There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training operations.     Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students normal and emergency procedures as defined in the Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) syllabus.     All three utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).     This includes a full functioning replica of the T-6 front seat cockpit and the same Instructor Operating Station (IOS).     Each simulator has no motion.     Each has five PC computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing system and the electronic control loading.     The primary difference in the devices is the level of corresponding visual system.     The Unit Training Device (UTD) has no visual system.     The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33 degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.     Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 or 10 Visual Control Computer and Image Generator.     Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.     The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five.

The other two ATDs are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer (EST).     The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning instruments and a moving stick and throttle.     It also has a canopy that replicates the opening forces of the A/C.     The EST is a standalone mock-up of the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection procedures.     A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been properly initiated.

The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their associated syllabi.     The T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.     The courseware was developed using Authorware.     Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate training platforms.

TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying training programs (T-6, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)     TIMS operates on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.     Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application server.     The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).           

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components.

On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and NAS Pensacola.     At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of 95%.     There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.     The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.     At the Navy location, the contractor provides manning, support equipment and replenishes Government owned spare parts.     Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are tracked using Magic Service Desk.

On-Site TIMS Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.     Each of these locations has CLS for the CAI labs and a Helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration, etc.).

Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740
Moody AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 709
Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328
Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268
Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672
Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320

Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS locations.     The MUSS supports:
ATD software and visual database maintenance
Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus Management)
Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and distribution
TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location)
Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location)


FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS

The required support will not include on-site ATD maintenance support for the Navy.     Excluding the Navy sites, the total support provided will be no less than the support described in the current environment above.     Support will be required to integrate T-6 and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.     TIMS MUSS support will require Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 certification as a minimum.     The contract type is anticipated to be fixed price with some T&M effort.

Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability and what might be subcontracted.     Provide experience and knowledge of:
1.           Simulator support
2.           Courseware support
3.           Training management systems and IT systems administration
4.           Software certification level
5.           Undergraduate/graduate flying training

If you have already responded to a prior sources sought announcement for this effort, updates may be submitted to address any changes contained herein.     Any comments to the documents for this effort may be addressed to the contracts representative, Ms. Lisa Adams, Lisa.Adams@wpafb.af.mil, or Ms. Michelle Hendricks, Michelle.Hendricks@wpafb.af.mil.

Information contained in this synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.     It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) 412 Test Wing, Edwards AFB, CA intends to award a follow-on five year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with five one-year options for the Air Traffic Control Communications Testing Facility and Avionics Systems Test (ACTFAST) Program to ARINC Engineering Services, LLC, 2551 Riva Road, Annapolis, MD 21401.  The required services, maintenance, system enhancements, and modifications to the existing hardware/software require access to ATC workstation software, CNS/ATM Gateway/Router software, and integrated ground stations (both ACARS and VDL Mode 2) that are proprietary to ARINC.  Experience with, and access to this proprietary software is necessary to maintain, upgrade, and support data link testing.  The VHF Data Link (VDL) ground stations support the VHF ACARS data link communications.  The VDL ground stations are connected to either the Test or Live networks, which are proprietary to the contractor.  These VDL ground stations interface to the ARINC Central Processing System (CPS) which uses ARINC proprietary interfaces and network to provide DSP end-to-end ACARS communication.  A separate, competed acquisition is anticipated to take place for award of those efforts associated with the ACTFAST facility which are not proprietary to the incumbent contractor.  This current proposed sole source contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received with fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Responses shall be sent via USPS or courier service for receipt at Edwards AFB no later than 16 Oct 2006, addressed to Joanne Eldredge, 412 TW/PKDD, 5 S. Wolfe Avenue, Building 2800, Edwards AFB, CA 93524.  Electronic responses of any type are not acceptable due to potential IT disruptions. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice of contract action (NOCA).

The work described below concerns the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House at 1 Bowling Green, NYC.  The building is a historic landmark and will celebrate its centennial next year.  All design and construction work connected with this building must be coordinated with GSA?s Regional Historic Preservation Officer (RHPO).

In August of 2006 marble pieces fell from vertical interior surfaces.  Steps were taken to either remove the marble or temporarily secure it in place to alleviate further dangerous situations.  A-E will be required to:
1. Do a survey of all the stone paneling throughout the building.  
2. Panels exhibiting less than safe adherence shall be discreetly marked for:
a)	Immediate repair/reattachment (i.e. within first 30 days of a construction contract)
b)	Longer term repair/reattachment (to be done after the immediate panels are corrected.)
3. In addition to the discreet marking of panels create a survey drawing identifying the panels in need of repair/reattachment.
4. Prepare a report describing the methods used to do the survey as well as the results.
5. Prepare specifications/drawings depicting the methods that a contractor must employ to repair/reattach the faulty panels.  The detail in the specs/drawings shall be clear enough to permit qualified contractors to bid on and carry out the needed repairs/reattachments.
6. Recommend at least three contractors that have performed similar restoration work.
7. Prepare estimates of the envisioned construction work.
8. It is noted that some panels have already been removed or broken.  It is desired, to the extent possible, to repair/reinstall these panels.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to modify an existing purchase order on a sole source basis for irrigation and farming services to Chairel Custom Haying, Blythe, CA.  The proposed contractor possesses the following unique qualifications which are required for this acquisition: Contractor currently has a lease with California Fish and Game Department to farm 1019 acres on the property known as Palo Verde Ecological Reserve.  Contractor is responsible for the irrigations schedule for the entire 1019 acres.  Contractor currently employees a full time staff to provide irrigation to PVER.  Integration and coordination of the irrigation requirements for both the active farm fields and restoration projects is critical.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Neutron Guides
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-06-856-SS04
<RESPDATE>102606
<ARCHDATE>11092006
<CONTACT>Todd Hill, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-975-8802, Fax null, Email todd.hill@nist.gov - Patrick Staines, Contract Specialist, Phone (301)975-6335, Fax (301)975-8884, Email Patrick.Staines@nist.gov
<DESC>NIST seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of designing, manufacturing and delivering neutron guides for use at the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR).  After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for neutron guides that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) (with multiple vendors if appropriate). 

Neutron guides are used as a conduit for beams of cold neutrons originating from a neutron cold source operated at the NCNR.  These devices utilize total external reflection to guide neutrons long distances with very low loss to neutron scattering instruments.  The performance of a neutron guide system is measured by the fraction of neutrons that can be transmitted through the guide system as a function of their angular divergence from the guide axis and as a function of neutron energy.   This performance is dependent on many factors that include the configuration of the reflecting surfaces (this will generally be a NIST responsibility to specify), quality and composition of the neutron-reflective coating(s), quality of the interior guide surfaces (flatness, roughness, waviness), and geometric accuracy.  Additional neutron guide performance qualities that are of importance to NIST include resistance to radiation damage, mechanical strength and stability, ability to withstand an internal vacuum, and ability to align the guides accurately.

Typical dimensions for a single neutron guide would be 5-6 cm wide (internal), 12-15 cm high (internal) and .5 - 1.5 m in length.  These are individually aligned and butt-joined by the NCNR in a linear fashion to form a guide tube.  A single Delivery Order might contain a single guide or as many as 50+ guides.  These might be identical or a composite of several line items of dissimilar guides.  The accumulated total demand for neutron guides at NIST may approach 300 meters over a two year period.

If NIST competitively solicits this requirement, we will utilize ?mock? delivery orders as part of the solicitation in order to thoroughly evaluate each offeror?s technical capability, past performance, and any other relevant information.   A delivery order is defined by a package containing a list of content items and quantities, corresponding drawings describing the guide geometry and parameters for each item, specifications and a delivery schedule.  Upon award of a BOA, the vendor(s) would in essence be prequalified to meet the Government?s requirements and thereafter, the Government would solicit amongst the BOA holder(s) as requirements are determined.   Under the BOA(s), NIST would have the flexibility to purchase neutron guides as our needs and project schedules dictate over a predetermined time period.  No funding is provided upon the initial award of a BOA; only upon award of a delivery order under the terms and conditions of the BOA are funds provided by the Government.

NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses.  Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 333314, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less.  Please include your company?s size classification in any response to this notice.  

Companies that manufacture neutron guides are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to todd.hill@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.  The report should include achievable specifications relevant to neutron transmission, corporate capabilities and capacities related to neutron guide design and production, names and capabilities/capacities of subcontractors, list and description of previous neutron guide manufacture (include references), and any other information relevant to neutron guide production ability.  Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice: 1. Name of the company that manufactures the neutron guides for which specifications are provided. 2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the neutron guides, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address). 3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems. 4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to todd.hill@nist.gov are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s). 5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.

<SUBJECT>--Market Research for Warlock Dragon Program Reference Number W15P7T-07-RFI-PMSW01
<DESC>Description:  Request for Information (RFI) to Support a Producibility and Sustainment Assessment for the Warlock Dragon Program Introduction:  This RFI is for planning purposes only; this is not a Request for Quotations or Proposals.  No solicitation document exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI.  The G overnment will not be liable for payment of any response preparation expenses.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government is issuing this RFI to ob tain information from industry which would permit a feasibility assessment of achieving accelerated high rate production of a new Counter Improvised Explosive Device (IED), the Warlock Dragon.  The Government is also interested in evaluating comments and r ecommendations relative to the potential impact(s) that accelerated high rate production of such systems will have on existing domestic supply chain participants as well as the existing infrastructures currently used to support inspection, test, acceptance  and fielding of comparably complex counter IED  and devices and Electronic Warfare (EW) equipment.  All interested firms that possess the capabilities and facilities addressed herein are encouraged to respond to this RFI by providing the information speci fied below, on or before 1700 hours on 5 October 2006. Responses to this RFI must be unclassified and should be sent via email to Matthew Ludwig at Matthew.Ludwig@us.army.mil and David Pak at David.S.Pak@us.army.mil.  Technical questions should be addresse d to David Pak at above email.  Background:  Program Executive Officer Intelligence and Electronics Warfare Systems and Product Director Signal Warfare, Fort Monmouth, NJ are continuously seeking the means to satisfy the urgent need for rapid manufacture and deployment of unprecedented q uantities of Counter IED equipment  and systems into Southwest Asia to support Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom (OIF and OEF).  To meet future requirements for production of Counter IED systems, the Government is interested in receiving industry recom mendations for providing effective manufacturing methods and processes to achieve required quantity yields and product reliability.  The specific system of interest is the Warlock Dragon, the newest addition to the Counter IED family of products.  The Gove rnment is seeking information from established firms with both the demonstrated capability of achieving accelerated high rate production of complex EW systems as well as providing insight into the potential impact(s) that accelerated high rate production c ould have on existing domestic supply chain participants and existing infrastructure(s) to support inspection, test, acceptance, fielding and sustainment of comparably complex counter IED and EW equipment.  Specifically, the Government is interested in ass essing the capacity of domestic manufacturing firms to mobilize for the production of approximately 500 Warlock Dragon systems based on a Government  supplied design; how fast the production rate could be ramped up; what the highest economic order quantity  would be to reach a peak monthly production rate; and, what rate could reasonably be sustained in order to achieve a high level of operational availability once the systems are fielded and released into their respective operational  environments.   Becaus e the nature of the IED threats is constantly changing, the Government recognizes that the Warlock Dragon performance capability will necessarily have to evolve in order to insure that its effectiveness remains relevant.  The existing Warlock Dragon protot ype system performance capabilities have been established by the design and assembly processes utilized Army Research Laboratory, Adelphi, MD which have been demonstrated and tested by the Army Test and Evaluation Command.  PD SW recognizes th e need for an industry assessment of the systems demonstrated performance capability with an eye towards improvement for inclusion of any emerging technological advancements in the field of counter-IED effectivity. To better understand the nature of the W arlock Dragon system, prototypes and associated documentation with drawings and ATEC system test data exist and will be made accessible to qualified domestic sources in accordance with the procedures described below.    Industry Capabilities of Interest:  The Government  is seeking responses from established firms with both the demonstrated capability of achieving accelerated high rate production of complex EW systems as well as those organizations capable of providing fi rst hand lessons learned or commercial best practices for dealing with the potential impact(s) that accelerated high rate production has on existing domestic supply chain participants and  infrastructure(s), especially those impacting support, inspection, test, acceptance, fielding and sustainment of comparably complex counter IED and EW equipment.  The Government is interested in receiving responses from firms with explicit knowledge of and experience with fielding of complex EW and counter IED systems to include total life cycle support considerations (i.e., total supply chain management and oversight functions, manufacturing process and provisioning documentation, optimal spares stockage rates based on reliability projections, and qualification of  field service representatives, etc.).  Firms should be capable of recommending best practices or sharing commercial standards for vendor surveillance/management, analysis techniques and/or metrics used to evaluate market conditions that would indicate the need t o establish multiple qualified sources of critical components. Of particular interest are firms with current internal practices wherein quality assurance and inspection of vendor parts has led to early detection of defects that minimized or avoided product ion delays.    Additionally, the Government desires recommendations from firms with knowledge of essential component lead times, industry standard assembly times for various types EW equipment and counter IED components, special tooling and test equipment,  methods for accelerated system qualification tests, real time engineering assessments for incorporation of technology upgrades into ongoing production, continual manufacturing process assessments to achieve improved  producibility,  reliability or ease of  operator use.  The Government is also interested in recommendations that would result in improved system performance (e.g., temperature, vibration, dust, etc.) given the extreme environmental conditions the system will be exposed to during mission operati ons. Notional Schedule of Events Related to this RFI. Firms interested in receiving any of the additional information identified in this RFI must submit a written request in accordance with the following procedures on or before close of business October 5, 2006:   The Warlock family of products and their associated system specifications contain information that has been designated as Militarily Critical Technical Data. Only businesses that have been certified by the Department of Defense, United States /Canada Joint  Certification Office, and have a valid requirement may obtain a copy of DD From 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement. To obtain certification, contact: Commander, Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), ATTN: U.S./Canada Joint Certific ation Office, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 or call DLIS at (800) 352-3572. The DLIS United States /Canada joint Certification Lookup service is available via the internet at: http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/documents.asp. Access to t he Warlock Dragon System documentation or prototype systems as described in this RFI shall only be granted once a certified DD Form 2345 is received and processed by PD SW Sec urity Officer, Alison Weaver, Alison.Weaver@us.army.mil. Only firms that have a verifiable SECRET level facility clearance may receive any of the additional information. To obtain a copy of the applicable Dragon documentation including Drawings, and Bill o f Materials, a written request on Corporate Letterhead needs to be forwarded to the PD SW Security Officer and must include the following information. Once this information is obtained and the appropriate clearance is verified, a copy of the documentation will be mailed. Company Name: Company Cage Code: Corporate Mailing Address: Classified Mailing Address: Security Office Information: Name / Title: Email: Phone:  PD SW plans to host an Industry Orientation and Overview of the Warlock Dragon Program the week of 10 October 2006 at the Army Research Laboratory facility in Adelphi, MD.  Government will coordinate registration and clearances to attend this event after r eceipt of the information identified above.  The purpose of this event is to provide interested firms access to both the ARL site where the system was designed and developed, and to allow access to an actual working prototype.  Additionally, PD SW will pro vide industry participants with a threat overview and insights on system test results provided by the ATEC community. The goal of this market research effort will be to have industry responses submitted for Government consideration after conclusion of the Program Orientation and Overview.  Notionally, this is anticipated to be around October 27th, 2006.  At that time, it is requested that all Industry responses be submitted in the format of an unclassified white paper.  The responses should provide the following information at a minimum: 1.	Corporate Capabilities in terms of experience and existing facilities capable of High Rate Manufacture of EW type equipment to include: current monthly production rate per month for similar systems or equipment; current methodology for subcontractor/ven dor management; whether there are any ongoing high rate production projects in the company at this time; identification of risks for high rate production and associated risk mitigation plans: automated production and test equipment currently in use; produc tion management initiatives, specifically those related to product quality; and current available production space, facilities and manufacturing capacity. 2.	Demonstrated ability to meet or accelerate production schedules. 3.	Experience in providing test and support for Government testing of EW type systems and equipment. 4.	Existing corporate depot type repair capability or facility. 5.	Identify any strategic partnering alliances that permit acceleration of component delivery or obtaining priority subcontracted support services. 6.	Identify core corporate personnel assets with expertise in EW and counter IED qualifications in the areas of design, manufacture, supply chain management, implementation of lean six sigma manufacturing improvements 7.	Existing expertise to conduct independent verification and validation through system engineering and analysis from preliminary manufacturing drawings, test plans and procedures. 8.	Identify any commercial/industrial certifications or quality systems in use  9.	Experience in performing core depot assessments to include identification of facility strengths and weaknesses in order to determine the necessity for capital investments in either equipment or facilities. 10.	Demonstrated capacity to achieve high rate manufacture of ruggedized  commercial or nondevelopmental products.  The Warlock family of products was recently designated a DX rated program under the Defense Priorities and Allocations System.  As such, PD SW is using this RFI as a primary means of conducting a real-time assessment of the US industrial base's ability to mobilize in support of accelerated delivery of EW systems like the Warlock Dragon.  Acceleration is defined in terms of both shorte ned lead times for testing, product delivery, and achieving maximum sustainable production rates with 30 days or less advance notice.  To completely assess the total life cycle elements of such an industrial mobilization, a sample size of approximately 500  systems is currently being considered in order to validate future decisions for capital investments in the domestic market infrastructure that might be necessary to support 'just in time' availability of critical components.  With this in mind the Governm ent would like your feedback with regard to the most probable cost and schedule estimates associated with the following efforts: -Estimated unit production price based on a total quantity of 500 systems.   -Estimated costs for system support, testing, documentation, and supply chain management to include an estimated number of support personnel required for field installation and system support at five forward operating bases in the OIF and OEF theaters of o peration. -Estimated costs for establishing a program directed towards a continual assessment of the changing threat environment and the ability of high rate manufacturers to cut in technology enhancements/system upgrades with minimal impact to production scheduling  and projected target system life cycle unit cost.   -Estimated lead time for critical components/vendor parts, assembly of the system, production rates, qualification testing, and potential capital investments in automation, special tooling or test equipment to enhance producibility, accelerate testing or i mprove serviceability in the field. -Estimated costs for suggested design changes to enhance producibility, ruggedization, or to improve system performance. -Corporate assessment of the domestic manufacturing base readiness posture with emphasis on critical component vendors of specialty parts unique to the counter IED component market.  Any information concerning the potential need for establishing multiple s ources of supply for critical, low density components to meet current and future demands should also be included. Commencing the first week of November 2006, the Government may afford interested parties an opportunity to discuss the contents of their White Papers during an industry one-on-one session where it is envisioned the parties will engage in an active informat ion exchange and dialogue to aid in the governments feasibility assessment.  It is anticipated that any such sessions would not exceed 3-4 hours and will take place at PM SW at Fort Monmouth, NJ.  It is envisioned that participation will be limited to a m aximum of five industry representatives that were involved in the preparation of the white paper being discussed.

New equipment ONLY, NO remanufactured products FOB DESTINATION CONUS *The Vendor may not substitute any item listed on this order without prior written approval by the Contracting Officer. *No other individual is authorized, either verbally or in writing to change part numbers, manufacturers, quantities, delivery dates or any other specification of this award. *Items that do not conform to descriptions and part numbers found in Block 17 will be rejected at the time of delivery causing a return at the Vendors expense. *Items received must adhere to the configuration as submitted and approved by the PMA Lab. *Vendors must deliver to the configuration as tested and approved. *Items not in compliance will be returned to the Vendor at no additional cost to the Government and comments will be noted to Vendor Performance. *Random Quality Assurance will be conducted to ensure Vendor/Manufacturer conformance. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of Office of Medical Services, M/MED/MI.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Hewlett Packard servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State medical systems requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. M/MED/MI has identified the Hewlett Packard ML570 server as a key component of the Office of the Medical Services networking environment. Equipment listed above is required to provide system failover capabilities to the Department of States electronic medical record systems.   It is imperative that the acquired servers are identical to the existing production servers for successful failover in the event of a disaster As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments medical systems failover requirements. The Hewlett Packard ML570 server has undergone test and assessment, and it is part of the approved local IT Configuration Control Board server baseline.

<DESC>PART I  -  GENERAL INFORMATION


A.  INTRODUCTION:

The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), in Hawaii, announces a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) for Architect and Engineering (A&E) firms interested in contracting for A&E Services for engineering planning services for the Northern Guam Watershed, located on the Island of Guam.

The primary goal of the Watershed Plan is to identify and evaluate potential sources of irrigation water, with particular emphasis on adequacy of volume to support agriculture through the dry season, impacts resulting from development of identified water resources and costs associated with developing the resources.  The development of the water resource specifically shall include infrastructure to deliver irrigation water for agricultural operations to each landholding within the planned area.

Tract 1021 (also referred to as Tract I or Tract 10120) is located in northern Guam.  It is under the jurisdiction of the Chamorro Land Trust Commission (CLTC) and dedicated to long term agricultural use.  The Northern Guam Soil & Water Conservation District (SWCD) is a government entity instituted by Government of Guam  Public Law 17-51.  The SWCD is comprised of five board members elected by the registered farmers.  The group is seeking assistance from NRCS to address an identified critical and recurring need for ample water supply for farmers in Tract 1021 in the villages of Dededo and Yigo.  More than 70 farmers hold long term agricultural leases in the 817 acre project area.

THIS PROCUREMENT IS UNRESTRICTED and is therefore open to all businesses regardless of size.  The primary North American Industrial Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541310, and the small business size standard is $4.5 million.  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence for the required work.  The Government contemplates the award of a firm-fixed price contract resulting from this competition.


B.  STATEMENT OF WORK:

The Contractor shall perform watershed planning to determine the quantity of irrigation water required to address agricultural needs for the planned area, possible sources of supplemental irrigation water, appropriate configurations (layout, sizes) of water distribution systems to the various parcels within the planned area.  The distribution system(s) may be independent of the water source however each potential source of irrigation water shall have a distribution system capable of delivering the necessary water to the various landholdings in the planned area.  Specifically the watershed plan shall include the costs and impacts (environmental, economic and social) of each irrigation water source and distribution configuration in accordance with NRCS policy, Federal and Territorial laws and regulations.  The technical feasibility (practicality of installation, system capacity, design life, etc.) of each evaluated water source and distribution system will be documented with maps, survey, computations, etc. in accordance with sound engineering practice.

The Contractor shall provide all expertise in agronomy, engineering, geology, hydrology, cultural resources, economics, and environmental/regulatory issues necessary to develop detailed alternative solutions to the problem of dry season water shortages.  The final product will be in the form of a draft Environmental Assessment (EA) or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) sufficient in detail and supporting documentation to be published for public comment and input.

Possible scenarios might include, but are not limited to, collection of water (runoff from impervious and low infiltration areas) combined with large storage capacity, minimal wells and sufficient storage to provide water over the duration of the dry season, a large number of wells and minimal storage (for regulating flow rather than depending on pump pressure to deliver water through the system),  Anticipated well yields shall be estimated on proposed locations and geologic information at the proposed location or if utilizing existing wells, known sustainable yield for the well.


C.  SPECIFIC ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN BY THE CONTRACTOR:

1.  Develop a Schedule of Work conforming to all applicable NRCS policy and criteria.  The plan shall include specific tasks with due dates for completion of the tasks and shall be in conformance with the Plan of Work, Exhibit 1 in the specifications.

2.  Assess the current condition of the planned area: physical boundaries, current land use, current available water supply, current agricultural water requirements, pertinent cultural resources present, relevant biologic concerns (flora and fauna), topographic, soil and geologic features, and socio-economic conditions (population, land use, regulations, general economics).

3.  Develop and document alternative solutions addressing any determined agricultural water shortages anticipated during dry seasons.  Alternatives will necessarily consider and anticipate changes in land use resulting from any increase in water availability resulting from the implementation of the alternative, i.e. should more water become available, it is likely that more land will be under intense agriculture use than the current situation.  In short, some anticipation of the future condition of the planned area must be included as part of the planning effort.

4.  Coordinate activities during the alternative development process with the Sponsors (Guam Department of Agriculture, the Northern Guam Soil and Water Conservation District), and USDA NRCS.  This will be accomplished with meetings with representatives of the four parties (NRCS, Northern Guam SWCD, Government of Guam Department of Agriculture) no less frequently than once per month during the performance period.  More frequent meetings may be required and other parties may have interest or need to participate in the meetings, e.g. Guam Waterworks Authority, Guam Department of Public Works, Chamorro Land Trust Commission, etc.

5.  The performance time is one hundred twenty (120) calendar days from NRCS acceptance of the mutually agreed to schedule of work submitted by the Contractor.  The final product will meet the requirements as listed in the Specifications.


 
D.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

The Contractor will furnish all equipment, personnel and materials to perform the tasks listed in the specifications.  The project will require knowledge and experience in land use planning, water supply and distribution planning, agriculture, possibly surveying, completing economic analysis and assessing current biological, cultural resource, social and environmental conditions and impacts of potential alternatives.

Formulation and evaluation of alternatives will likely include literature search, contact with affected landowners, public utilities, project sponsors, regulatory authorities, the general public, and others.  Site investigation for the area to be planned is essential as is documentation of the data gathered (digital photographs, spreadsheets, documents, maps, notes, etc.).  



PART II  -  PRE-SELECTION CRITERIA

Only firms meeting the following criteria will be considered for further evaluation

1.  Employ two (2) engineers on a full time basis with one registered in the Territory of Guam.  Engineering experience will be at least for distinct experiences in the planning or design of water supply, water distribution, and/or irrigation type water resource projects.

2.  Have either in-house or available as a subcontractor a source for performing topographic surveys.  Four distinct topographic survey experiences must be listed on the submitted Standard Form 330, Architect-Engineer Qualifications.

3.  Demonstrate sufficient capacity and experience in-house, or have ability to access in a timely fashion for duration of the contract, the necessary professional expertise to conduct planning activities in accordance with procedures established in Economic & Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources Implementation Studies and the NRCS documentation cited previously.



PART III  -  SELECTION CRITERIA

Firms meeting the pre-selection criteria will be evaluated and ranked using the following selection criteria:

1.  Specialized Experience and Technical Competence in the Type of Work Required (40%)

2.  Professional Qualifications Necessary for Satisfactory Performance (20%).

3.  Capacity to Accomplish the Work (20%)

4.  Past Performance on Contracts with Government Agencies and Private Sector (20%). 



PART IV  -  CONTACT INFORMATION

VI.  Description of requirement:   This is a brandname requirement.  Brandname requirement is based upon the authority FAR 6.302-1(2)(C)(ii) which allows for the purchase if it is considered a follow-on contract for the continued development of a system when the award would result in duplication of cost. This is true in this case as the purchase of this switch is to upgrade the NORAD/NORTHCOM (N-NC)/J625 Trusted Information Exchange (TIE) NIPRNet Portal Project.  All the equipment currently in the switch room (approximately 500 plus pieces of equipment), is EMC Brand.  Integrating a different switch with the EMC switches will: Decrease performance, stability and reliability; require approximately $200K of retraining of Air Force and contractor operators/maintainers; would require an additional support and maintenance contract; would increase the likelihood of downtime; will increase the risk of compromise of the NORAD/NORTHCOM mission.

TRICARE requires the following:  

I.	Introduction:

TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is responsible for editing and processing hospital outpatient claims for TRICARE eligible beneficiaries.  3M Health Information Systems has developed an Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) for editing and processing hospital outpatient claims which will be utilized upon implementation of TRICAREs Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) tentatively scheduled for implementation on June 1, 2007.  The supplemental functionality required by TMA is for licensing a mainframe version of a TRICARE specific OPPS Pricer that can be fully integrated with the 3M OCE, and licensing PC Versions that integrate both the OCE and Pricer software and are compatible with the TRICARE mainframe software.  

II.	Purpose:

The purpose of this Statement of Work is to outline TMAs requirements for licensing a commercial mainframe version of a TRICARE specific OPPS Pricer that can be fully integrated with the 3M OCE, and licensing PC versions that includes both the OCE and Pricer software for auditing and verification of accuracy of payment for hospital outpatient claims.  This procurement will be for the licensing, maintenance and updating of both the mainframe and PC software versions as they become available.  The maintenance, to include quarterly updates, will have a 12 month period of performance for the Base year and four successive one year Option Periods.  

III.	Background:

a.	TMA is legislatively mandated to follow all Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reimbursement methodologies whenever practicable.  As a result, TMA has been working on the development, in conjunction with 3M, and implementation of a prospective payment system for processing hospital outpatient claims.  OPPS is comprised of two components:

	1.	The first component is the Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) designed for editing and processing hospital outpatient claims.  Since 3M maintains CMS OCE they agreed to develop and maintain a similar TRICARE OCE.  They will retain proprietary rights to the software. 

 	2.	The second component is the Pricer that determines how to price claims 	based on the output from the OCE.  Due to the complexity of TRICAREs OPPS, the TRICARE Management Activity has decided to license a commercial mainframe TRICARE Pricer to include quarterly updates that coincide with those of CMS.  

(a)	TRICARE is congressionally mandated to follow CMS OPPS reimbursement methodology where practicable.  It is critical the Contractor have access to advance copies of CMS OCE changes in order to meet quarterly updates.  In accordance with 32 C.F.R. 199.1 (c)(2)(ii), CMS has agreed to allow 3M to provide TRICARE with advance copies of OCE changes due to the delegated authority given to the Assistant Secretary for Health, DHHS, to consult with the Secretary of Defense, or a designee and to approve and issue joint regulations implementing 10. U.S.C. chapter 55.

(b)	TMA has decided to license a mainframe version of the TRICARE Pricer software in order to ensure: 

i.	Uniformity of Pricing among Regions
ii.	Programmatic control to ensure consistent and timely updates(requires quarterly updating of pricing files)
iii.	Consistency with CMS pricing methodologies 
iv.	Integration between TRICARE specific OCE and Pricer software
v.	Portability of Pricer software for future contract transitions 

IV.	Deliverable/s:

The Contractor shall deliver the following:

New equipment ONLY, NO remanufactured products FOB DESTINATION CONUS *The Vendor may not substitute any item listed on this order without prior written approval by the Contracting Officer. *No other individual is authorized, either verbally or in writing to change part numbers, manufacturers, quantities, delivery dates or any other specification of this award. *Items that do not conform to descriptions and part numbers found in Block 17 will be rejected at the time of delivery causing a return at the Vendors expense. *Items received must adhere to the configuration as submitted and approved by the PMA Lab. *Vendors must deliver to the configuration as tested and approved. *Items not in compliance will be returned to the Vendor at no additional cost to the Government and comments will be noted to Vendor Performance. *Random Quality Assurance will be conducted to ensure Vendor/Manufacturer conformance. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Office of the Secretary, Executive Secretariat, Office of Information Resource Management (S/ES-IRM).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of HP storage devices.   S/ES-IRM has identified HP storage devices as a key component of our information technology base.  S/ES-IRM provides information technology services and support for the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Office of the Executive Secretariat and the principal officers of the Department.   We need to use hard drives with proven results.  HP has a long term record of reliability which is supported by all industry reviews.  This request is actually an upgrade of the drives on our existing HP Storage Area Network.  We need HP drives to maintain our warranty and support agreements.   Our hardware technicians are HP certified and are experts at the repair and maintenance of the HP storage units.  They have taken the SAN support/maintenance training and are cleared to work on the HP SAN know as Enterprise Virtual Array or EVA.  Sunk costs make it too expensive to change vendors.  It would require almost one million dollars to change the SAN equipment to accommodate another vendors drives so a significant expense to the government.      As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the requirements of this office.   The HP Storage Area Network has undergone test, assessment and evaluation and received final approval from our IT Configuration Control Board.

S/ES-IRM has identified HP storage devices as a key component of our information technology base.  S/ES-IRM provides information technology services and support for the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Office of the Executive Secretariat and the principal officers of the Department.   We need to use hard drives with proven results.  HP has a long term record of reliability which is supported by all industry reviews.  This request is actually an upgrade of the drives on our existing HP Storage Area Network.  We need HP drives to maintain our warranty and support agreements.   Our hardware technicians are HP certified and are experts at the repair and maintenance of the HP storage units.  They have taken the SAN support/maintenance training and are cleared to work on the HP SAN know as Enterprise Virtual Array or EVA.  Sunk costs make it too expensive to change vendors.  It would require almost one million dollars to change the SAN equipment to accommodate another vendors drives so a significant expense to the government.      As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the requirements of this office.   The HP Storage Area Network has undergone test, assessment and evaluation and received final approval from our IT Configuration Control Board. <BR><BR>

IF SINGLE LINE ITEMS HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED INTO MAJOR COMPONENT, SHIPPING DOCUMENTS MUST ACCOUNT FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ITEMS SHIPPED WITHIN THE MAJOR COMPONENT. New equipment ONLY, NO remanufactured products FOB DESTINATION CONUS 1.	I recommend that the Department of State use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of Pulizzi Engineering, Inc., Dual Power Distribution and Control Products. The estimated cost is $29,000.00.  This requirement will be used for the new Alternate Communications Site (ACS). This requirement will allow the systems personnel at the ACS to install these devices without any systems or facility modifications thus greatly reducing the main PDU excessive power spikes by allowing a second PDU to come online. These Pulizzi Engineering, Inc., Dual Power Distribution and Control Products are unique in that, after an extensive search and previously posting our requirement on FEDBID, it appears that they are the only vender that manufactures a Dual Input Power Distribution Unit that meets our unique requirement and specifications. The previous FEDBID APC solution and proposed products were of lesser quality and did not meet the required specifications and would have forced this division to order 16 additional units at an additional cost of over $7000.00 which is unacceptable.  The acquisition of Pulizzi Engineering Model T2235-C1-CNB09L Dual Input Auto Switching Power Distribution Systems and their Model 010-9334 Power Adapters conforms to the existing Alternate Sites systems infrastructure and design. Receipt of the items only would accommodate this urgent power requirement by being easily installed in the rack systems immediately upon receipt.   4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  SUBPARA 6.3  Other than full and open competition paragraph 6.302-1  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of Office of Medical Services, M/MED/MI.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Hewlett Packard servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State medical systems requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. M/MED/MI has identified the Hewlett Packard ML570 server as a key component of the Office of the Medical Services networking environment. Equipment listed above is required to provide system failover capabilities to the Department of States electronic medical record systems.   It is imperative that the acquired servers are identical to the existing production servers for successful failover in the event of a disaster As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments medical systems failover requirements. The Hewlett Packard ML570 server has undergone test and assessment, and it is part of the approved local IT Configuration Control Board server baseline.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION

1. CONTRACTING DIVISION: 366 CONS/LGCB. 26 September, 2006.

2. NATURE OF ACTION BEING APPROVED: Brand Name Justification and Approval for a Purchase Order Below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.

3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES AND SERVICES: Equipment and installation of a Pelco Pan/Tilt/Zoom camera at the Grand View Gate.  Equipment to be purchased is; 1ea. Pelco Dome Spectra III C to BW (part # SD53CBW-HPE1), 1ea. Pelco Outdoor Housing (part # DD53CBW), 1ea. Pelco Power Supply (part # WCS1-4), 1ea. Pelco Pendant Mount (part #IWM-WT), and 2ea. IFS Single Mode Fiber Modems W/ Data (part # VT/R 1530 WDM).

4. AUTHORITY:  FAR 11.105 Brand Name and FAR 13.106(b), Pelco is the established Security Camera Control System on Mountain Home Air Force Base (MHAFB. Contract # F10603-03-A071A is a maintenance contract with Integrated Security Systems (ISS), for the existing 7 cameras currently supporting the security system on MHAFB.  The subject acquisition will integrate into the existing multiplexer, keyboard, and DVR warranted and maintained under the aforementioned contract until 2007. There is no other high resolution camera that would be 100% compatible to the existing system and uphold the manufactures warranty. If any foreign product, other than Pelco integrates into the existing system, Pelco?s  manufacturers warranty will void all of the existing parts under the current contract. That action would void $174,902.37 of the Governments dollars and would not be cost effective. 

5. APPLICATION OF AUTHORITY:  The Security Forces currently has security cameras installed in strategic locations throughout the installation, which are all controlled by a multiplexer located at the Security Forces Control Center in Building 1013.  These cameras are a critical part of the installation?s Integrated Base Defense Operations and are vital to the security of the installation?s resources and personnel.  If these cameras become inoperative it would create a major security deficiency and would degrade the installation?s overall security.  An incompatible camera system would greatly affect the frequency of the hardware and software anomalies to this multiplexer, intern degrading the security of this installation. 

6. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN FAIR COMPETITION:  Technical experts in the Communications Squadron, and reliable security companies and have verified that a different camera would conflict and not have 100% integrate with the current Pelco cameras or controllers.  

7. FAIR AND REASONABLE COST: Price fair and reasonable will be based on market research and competitive quotes IAW FAR Part 13.106-3.

8. MARKET SURVEY:   All practicable measures were taken to research the availability of additional vendors and manufacturers that can satisfy this requirement.  The government will continue to search for vendors that manufacture and install the necessary line retiming module.

9. OTHER FACTS: Currently, Security Forces Squadron and Fighter Wing are working together to purse a requirements contract to cover all maintenance of our security systems base wide. This Pelco camera system will fall under the new warranty/maintenance of this upcoming contract.   The Communications Squadron has reduced its manning, therefore the communication technicians will no longer be available to provide maintenance of MHAFB?s security systems, to include these existing and new cameras.  Therefore this warranty is even more prudent than ever to uphold, as there would be no military member with the expertise to repair the equipment.

10 . STEPS TO FOSTER COMPETITION: We will continue to search for competitive companies that provide equipment compatible with our telephone switch.

11. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS/PERSONNEL CERTIFICATION:  I certify the information contained in this justification is accurate and complete.

                                                                ____________________________________

				                 Resource Protection Manager

12. CONTRACTING OFFICERS CERTIFICATION: The contracting officer?s signature below represents a certification the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the contracting officer?s knowledge and belief.

                                                                 _____________________________________

<DESC>"BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION FOLLOWS AS IS: 1.  In order to complete our existing fleet, the 908th Maintenance Group has a requirement to purchase additional E-Z-Go shuttle and utility carts.  The proposed carts will be utilized within the Maintenance Group in supporting aircraft maintenance within 13 flights, situated in various locations on Maxwell Air Force Base, AL.   At the present time, the 908th Airlift Wing has an inventory of 34 carts, with 30 located within the Maintenance Group.  Purchase of the E-Z-Go brand will provide continuity not only in the Maintenance Group but also throughout the entire 908th Airlift Wing.  2.  Familiarity with E-Z-Go carts presents an advantage to the Maintenance Group in that personnel know how to properly operate, provide maintenance and install replacement parts.  Purchase of another brand would require training for personnel to operate and maintain, as well as locate a supplier for different brand replacement parts.  The purchase of the E-Z-Go brand would also provide the Maintenance Group with the advantage of dealing with one contractor for problems, service, etc., as well as having several sources in the Montgomery area for replacement parts.  3.  It is in the best interest of the government to award this requirement to E-Z-Go or a supplier of the E-Z-Go brand of carts.  This request is in compliance with FAR 6.303."
