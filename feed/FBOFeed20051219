<DESC>The Western Area Power Administration intends to acquire on a Sole Source basis for Oil Leak Repairs at Curecanti Substation Transformer.  1. Requirements: The Technical requirements of this Statement of Work (SOW) involve the following: a.  The contractor shall provide all necessary labor, material, equipment, travel, per diem, and mobilization expenses necessary to stop the oil leaks on one (1) high voltage transformer at Western Area Power Administrationâ€™s Curecanti Substation, Colorado, as follows:  i. Equipment: KZ1A4 Elettrameccanighe Lombrado serial D568964.  ii. The Contractor shall furnish all materials and supplies required for the work under this contract. Materials include but are not limited to leak locators, cleaners, non-adhering sealants, form clamps and other items as required.  iii. The repairs shall be made without removing the oil and disassembling the transformer.  2. Government Furnished Equipment, Supplies, Materials and Services: The Government will furnish a safety barrier between the transformer being worked on and adjacent energized equipment. A qualified electrical worker will also be present while the contractor is in the substation.  3.  Period of Performance: The contractor will be required to submit a work plan to the Contracting Officerâ€™s Representative (COR), and the start date will be agreed upon by the Contractor and COR.  All work needs to be completed no later than October 31, 2005.  4.  Hours of Work:  The hours of work will be the same hours as those set for Government personnel at the work location, unless otherwise agreed to by the COR.  5.  Safety:  In performing the work required by this contract, the contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State, or local safety, health, or industrial safety codes including the latest effective standards promulgated by the Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Safety and Health Standards 29 CFR 1910, 29 CFR 1925, and the Construction Safety and Health regulations promulgated under Section 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, 29 CFR 1926.  If there is a conflict between the requirements of the applicable Federal, State, or local safety, health, or industrial safety codes, the more stringent requirements shall prevail.

Prior to starting work, an onsite safety meeting shall be held with Westernâ€™s representative to address and discuss safety procedures related to the work required.

When work is performed at Western facilities the contractor shall provide all required personal protective equipment.  A contract was awarded on 09/09/05 for this transformer on several leaks.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), National Highway Institute (NHI) plans to award multiple 5-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts for the development and presentation of Highway Safety Training. Training delivery methods may include traditional classroom, distance learning and/or computer-based self-teaching.  Successful offerors will be invited to compete for award of subsequent task orders that may also include other functions relating to highway safety training delivery such as needs assessment, marketing, or electronic formatting for Section 508 compliance.  Limited research necessary for development of technical reference manuals may be included.  Information about the NHI and its course offerings in the area of Highway Safety as well as the NHI style guide may be found on the NHI web site at www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov.  Additional courses or web-based offerings may be added as needs are defined. In addition to a thorough knowledge of instructional systems design (ISD) and adult learning principals, subject matter expertise may be required in a variety of areas.

The National Highway Institute (NHI) is the technical training arm of the Federal Highway Administration, and as such plays a vital role in the FHWA's overall effort to provide training in new and evolving highway related technologies.  The target audience is very broad, and includes Federal, state and local highway and transportation agencies located within the United States, the Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP) Centers, associations, consulting firms, private industry, universities and other national and international entities engaged in highway work of interest to the United States.  In order for NHI to best accomplish its training mission it is necessary to accurately determine the needs of the target audience, and then develop and deliver a variety of training packages that will most effectively and efficiently present the intended message. 

The NHI has been performing this role primarily by delivering traditional, instructor-lead, classroom training on a broad range of topic areas since it was established by congress in 1970.  However, the electronic era is rapidly opening new avenues for cost savings, complying with divergent schedules, and training larger audiences in shorter periods of time.  These avenues need to be explored and enhancements to the current approaches implemented.  

For this procurement, it is imperative that subject matter experts team with instructional systems design (ISD) specialists, internet content developers, experts in the development of multi-media training materials, and graphic arts to ensure that new course developments - as well as updates of existing NHI courses - incorporate state-of-the-art instructional systems design and adult learning principles.  Instructor-led course presentations require highly qualified, subject matter experts who have experience with deploying adult learning techniques in the classroom in compliance with Section 504 requirements.

The solicitation will be available over the Internet only.  NO HARD COPIES will be sent.  Follow the links on the EPS website to access the solicitation:  USAF Offices, Air Mobility Command Locations, and 436 CONS, Dover AFB, DE.  Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.     All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.  IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:  Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form.  Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided.  Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.  As of January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and 
certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision 
that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN.  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized 
use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order 
to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.     The POC for this acquisition is Lt Megan Spilinek (302) 677-5226, Fax (302) 677-2309, E-Mail at megan.spilinek@dover.af.mil.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to procure on a sole source basis, software development, systems integration, and support services for the Command and Control Personal Computer (C2PC) from Northrop Grumman Information Technology in San Diego, California.  The justification permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.”  A Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF) for the software development to finalize versin 7.0 and 7.1 and Time and Materials (T&M) for engineering services and Post Deployment Software Support is anticipated.  The total estimated cost of this acquisition is $38,000,000.  The estimated date of contract award is January 2006.  The Period of Performance is from FY 06 through FY 09.  The proposed contractual action will procure software integration and interoperability enhancements of the Command and Contr!  ol Personal Computer (C2PC) software in support of the Intelligence Operations System (IOS), Data Automated Communications Terminal (DACT), Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS), Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV) (formerly known as the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle or AAAV), Tactical Combat Operations (TCO), Tactical Remote Sensor System (TRSS), Tactical Exploitation Group (TEG), Joint Warning and Reporting Network (JWARN), Target Location Designation Handoff System (TLDHS) and Family of Interoperable Operational Pictures (FIOP) efforts which comprise “The Tactical Common Operating Environment (COE) Workstation”.  The contractor shall provide the above-mentioned program management, training, software design, code and test, technical support for systems integration, and functional software to support the C2PC Program.  In response to Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) Memorandum 161-03, the Marine Corps and the Army agreed to migrate to a s!  ingle platform by FY06 at the brigade and above echelons in order to i mprove interoperability.  The designated platform is C2PC.  The core functionality of C2PC must be enhanced to meet Army requirements in order to achieve the desired interoperability.  NGIT is the only viable source capable of developing, testing, integrating and delivering the required software functionality by FY06 due to their extensive knowledge of C2PC and complexity of the existing software code.  NGIT is the current developer of the 7.0 software.  No source code or any other data package is available for competition.  The Solicitation No. M67854-06-R-2000 is available by request.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in support of PMW 180 intends to issue a Request for Proposal for 300 modified Commercial-Off- Theâ€“Shelf (COTS), Universal Shipborne Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) in FY06, followed by an option for another 200 AIS in FY07.  This synopsis and resultant solicitation for commercial items will be in accordance with FAR Part 12.  An Indefinite Quantity, Firm Fixed Price contract is planned.  Quantities are planned for a minimum of 20 and maximum of 500.  SPAWAR plans to issue a solicitation within the next two weeks.  All interested offerors are requested to monitor the SPAWAR e-commerce site at http://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil. Each AIS shall consist of, as a minimum, a class "A" transponder unit, minimum keyboard display (MKD), associated input/output junction, connection, or distribution boxes, internal GPS, and all associated cables. Delivery shall also include Warranty and supporting documentation for use of the equipment.   Additionally, the Navy is considering optimal antenna options, whether to diplex AIS with existing antenna capabilities or adding a "stand- alone" antenna.  For the purposes of this synopsis, plan on inclusion of a one- half (Â½) wavelength vertical VHF antenna (and all associated cables) as an itemized portion of the proposal, in the event it is included in the contract. Modifications for AIS in support of the upcoming solicitation will include receive- only and restricted modes of operation to support Navy missions.  The operator must be able to change to any mode within 60 seconds.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to negotiate with Interindustry Economic Research Fund, Inc. to contract for an inter industry input-output model that measures inter industry transactions consistent with industry value added in the economy and total economic final demand (GDP).  This will be negotiated on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 U. S. C. 253 (c)(1) only one responsible source for a 12-month base period and one 12-month option period. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541519, and the size standard is $21.0M. The responsibilities of the Office of Policy Development (OPD) within the Economic and Statistics Administration (ESA) includes the ability to evaluate impacts to industries and the economy. Recent examples of OPD’s use of the Long-Term Forecasting Tool (LIFT) model was to examine the economic consequences of terrorist attack scenarios--three scenarios for the Department of Homeland Security and one for the Council of Economic Advisers. OPD, over the last two years, also used the model to assess industry performance: Information Technology (IT) industries in ESA/OPD’s Digital Economy reports, IT Use in Infrastructure Industries, and estimating the size and the economic performance of Biotechnology industries. LIFT was also used in providing support for understanding impacts of various industry issues that could affect the Administration’s domestic policy: implementing steel tariffs, higher crude oil prices, reduced petroleum refining capacity, and a possible longshoreman’s strike on the West Coast. In order to perform these types of tasks, OPD needs an interindustry input-output model that measures interindustry transactions consistent with industry value added in the economy and total economic final demand (GDP). The model needs to be versatile enough so that impacts to individual industries can be simulated in the economy as well as the effects of macroeconomic variables on individual industry performance. The model also needs to relate output to jobs by occupations and by number of employees. Offerors certain they can meet the requirements are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities. All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements. The response must be sufficient to permit agency analysis to establish a bonafide capability to meet the requirements. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the Government proceeding as stated above. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 10-days after publication of this synopsis. All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to the attention of Amy.SandersWhite@noaa.gov, Purchasing Agent. Note 22 applies with the exception of number of days advertised shall read 10 days.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION
Interim Capability aircraft

PURPOSE/DESCRIPTION

        The purpose of this sources sought research is to analyze industry capabilities to convert seven existing C-130H2 aircraft into an Interim Configuration (IC) of an MC-130H Combat Talon II as defined in the attached file below.  The IC capability will be similar to that of the MC-130P.  In general terms, the program’s intent is the installation of one integrated Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) which incorporates approximately twenty-five (25) smaller TCTOs.    The Government estimates this IC conversion to be an approximately 40,000 hour installation labor effort which doesn’t include Group A manufacturing labor.  The intent is to be a build to print acquisition and a data/work package will be provided for installation.  A subcontractor for engineering support services may be directed.  Equipment/systems/support equipment needed may be provided GFE.  The government will be pursuing a firm, fixed price contract for this effort.  Further clarification of the individual TCTOs and other modifications that comprise the data package will be put out on PIXIS very shortly.  Please check for updates and amendments.

New Information (12/19/2005):
+++++++++++++++++++ CLARIFICATION ON TEAMING++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The government is attempting to gather data on sources capable of PRODUCTION of the Interim Capability (IC) aircraft at a facility other than government owned/operated.  If you intend to partner with another entity, it must be an INDUSTRY-INDUSTRY partnership for production of the Interim Capability effort.  The government has already gathered data on an INDUSTRY-GOVERNMENT partnership.  Your submission of cost/schedule/capabilities will help the government make a “best-value” decision for production of the IC effort.

Evaluation for award will be Price-Performance Tradeoff (PPTO).  Issuance of the solicitation will be on 16 Aug 2005 and will close on 15 Sep 2005 at 4:00PM EST.  The solicitation will be available over the Internet only.  NO HARD COPIES will be sent.  Follow the links on the EPS website to access the solicitation:  USAF Offices, Air Mobility Command Locations, and 436 CONS, Dover AFB, DE.  Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.     All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award.  IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:  Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests.  Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form.  Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.  Use of the basic system is at NO COST to the contractor and training will be provided.  Information available at no cost is located at http://www.wawftraining.com.  As of January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and 
certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision 
that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA.  Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN.  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized 
use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version.  Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order 
to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.     The POC for this acquisition is Lt Megan Schmid (302) 677-5226, Fax (302) 677-2309, E-Mail at megan.schmid@dover.af.mil.

NOTE: The CO Finding  letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI clause for  XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  ************************************************************************  Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting  Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant concern for  successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration Services  contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to reflect  this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address the  OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government. The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and  the re-drafted OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below. *********************************************************************** Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming  competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require offerors to  submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services that  involve a high level of complex skill sets. The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500  employees. The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of  500 could overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust  subcontracting plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses  that could provide support for this acquisition and artificially reduce  subcontracting goals. Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small  business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small business  participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition  has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been  coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business  Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 - Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release  Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed  on 8 July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at  the Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was  determined that this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business  (SB)Set-Aside. The SB strategy under consideration will require offers to  provide aggressive small business subcontracting participation in any  proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the  Acquisition Plan, we will consider up to two awards for consolidated  Function Areas A, B, C and E under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best  Value Source Selection decision). Area D may be made as a stand alone  award or combined with an A-B-C-E award. Organizational Conflict of  Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that will be addressed in a  tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be posted to PIXS in the  next two weeks. The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days  to late Sept 2005. Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP.  Release of the formal RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with  proposals due early Jan 06. Award is contemplated late April 06. A new  attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort.  ********************************************************************** Update 8 July 2005: Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has  been added to the library (scroll below).

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice to identify sources that can provide an adaptive optics (AO) subsystem for use in free space optical communications.  The Optics Division (AFRL/DES) has engaged in research and development to achieve a higher technical maturity level for curvature based wavefront sensing adaptive optic (AO) systems. The objectives of this effort are to develop, fabricate, and demonstrate an adaptive optics (AO) subsystem for use in free space optical communications. This AO subsystem would provide a significant improvement in laser communications link availability between ground-to-ground terminals; ground-to-and from-airborne mobile terminals; and eventually between airborne mobile terminals. Previous efforts had the specific goal of increasing system bandwidths to greater than 6Khz with a technical path for increasing system bandwidths to 10Khz. The goal of this current effort will be to produce a system capable of achieving system bandwidths exceeding 10Khz.  Respondents must have previously demonstrated Adaptive Optics system performance at closed loop bandwidths exceeding 2.5khz, and have demonstrated such adaptive optics systems in integrated bi-directional FSO links.

Respondents are required to provide a statement of capability containing pertinent and specific information addressing the following areas: 1. Experience: An outline of projects previously performed relevant to the subject areas. 2. Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of scientific, engineering and program management personnel who might be assigned to work in the areas of subject effort. 3. Facilities: Availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration. Responses are limited to 15 pages including program plan, resumes, attachments, diagrams, etc. Any responses not addressing all requirements will be rejected. Submit responses to Linda Buix, AFRL/PKDL, 2251 Maxwell Ave. SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5773 no later than fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of this announcement by 3:00 p.m., Mountain Daylight Time (MDT). This is an unrestricted announcement under NAICS code 541710. However, firms should indicate whether they are or not a small business, woman-owned, qualifying 8(a) businesses, certified HUBZone small businesses, or historically black colleges, universities, and minority institutions (HBCU/MI). In order to receive a DoD contract, offerors must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system and the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program. For more information and on-line registration with CCR, see http://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mil.

<DESC>SPECIAL NOTICE - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION -THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, NO CONTRACT WILL BE ISSUED ---

FITNESS CENTER ACCESS PROJECT ---

The Social Security Administration (SSA) has identified a need to provide greater fitness center access to its employees.  SSA currently has established fitness centers for its employees’ use at six SSA locations.  SSA has also entered into arrangements with other Federal agencies at various Federal joint-use fitness centers which permit SSA employees access to those facilities, but these joint use arrangements and SSA-built centers serve just a fraction of SSA employees.  

SSA has 65,000 employees nationwide who may utilize fitness centers if offered reduced rates and non-restrictive memberships.   The goal of SSA’s Fitness Center Access Project is to increase fitness center access for SSA employees nationwide by providing access through one or more companies that have established fitness center network(s).  These networks will offer membership discounts to employees of SSA.  The objec!ive will be to reduce the cost barrier to fitness club memberships, thereby encouraging a regimen of regular physical activity by SSA employees.

However, SSA does not have the resources to locate and determine chain and individual fitness centers or health clubs to recommend to its employees.  SSA is looking for a facilitator of these services.  SSA would refer its employees to such a facilitator.  

SSA is looking for companies that can: 1) Provide access for SSA employees to a network(s) of chain and individual fitness clubs at a membership discount that is greater than what an employee could obtain without this service; 2) Pursue additions to the network clubs where possible in areas where SSA employees are located; 3) Enroll SSA employees who apply for membership in network clubs; 4) Handle membership, billing and network club administrative duties;  5) Maintain a directory of network clubs that lists names and addresses of current network fitness clubs and provide a mechanism for SSA employees to directly access this directory; and  6) Upon request, provide SSA with membership reporting data as well as assist SSA with ways to increase and accurately measure fitness center utilization.   The provider would be required to protect employee confidentiality by not identifying individuals to any non-SSA party.  To protect employee confidentiality, data provided to SSA will be required to be aggregated by geographic location and not identify individual employees.

SSA does not intend to issue a contract for these services.  SSA is looking for a qualified provider that can perform the referenced services and to which SSA can refer the use of the provider to its employees.  For its part SSA will advertise and promote the Fitness Center Access Project and refer SSA employees to the qualified providers.  SSA may refer its employees to more than one qualified provider in any particular area.  

In order to be a qualified provider you must: 1) Have experience and success at managing a fitness center discount network and 2) Have an established network of individual and chain fitness centers.

If you are interested in partnering with SSA in its implementation of the Fitness Access Project please detail information outlining your capabilities and evidence that your company can perform the required services.  You should supply written references and contact information from at least four entities that have used your services in a similar fashion to secure employee access to a fitness club network.

This is NOT a Request for Proposa and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted.  RESPONSES  ARE DUE BY JANUARY 13, 2006.  Send all information related to this announcement to: Social Security Administration, Center for Employee Services, Attn: Lamont Brown, 2422 Annex, 6401 Security Blvd., Baltimore, Maryland 21235.  Reference SSA-RFI-Fitness-06.  Direct any questions relating to this announcement to Mr. Lamont Brown at 410-965-8077.

<SOLNBR>W909MY-06-R-PM03
<RESPDATE>011806
<ARCHDATE>03192006
<CONTACT>Carrodena Johnson, (703) 325-8677
<DESC>The U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command - (C-E LCMC) Washington Sector, on behalf of the US Army RDECOM, CERDEC, Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Countermine Division, is conducting market research to identify companies having technology, qualification and capabilities to demonstrate ground vehicle mounted forward looking radar capabilities to detect improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Specifically, the goal of the market research is to identify companies with prior experience and the ability to rapidly mature and demonstrate forward looking radar technologies to detect IEDs.  For this market research, forward looking radar technologies include variations of ground penetrating synthetic aperture radar, harmonic radar, and intermodulation radar.  Maturity for this market survey is defin ed as a minimum technology readiness (TRL) level of 5, or a clear path to demonstrate TRL 5 or greater within 12 to 24 months.  A TRL 5 level of maturity is defined as a component and/or breadboard whose basic  technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so that the technology can be tested in a simulated environment. Examples include 'high fidelity' laboratory integration of components.  Success at achieving TRL 5 is dem onstrated by achieving detection of a variety of representative IED targets or surrogates, configured in a simulated setting.  Results of this market research may be used to formulate a near-term technology maturation and limited fielding program that inte grates forward looking radar technology onto a military ground vehicle or manned/unmanned platform. A future program may include the following Performance Objectives: Detection of a variety of IED configurations in various scenarios at probabilities of det ection greater than 90%, standoff distances greater than 20 meters in front of the host vehicle, and false alarms less than  one per kilometer while moving.  IEDs may include thick-shelled military munitions or improvised explosive packages adapted with integral triggers such as contact sensors, command-or remotely-fired triggers, as well as a wide range of possible explosive ty pes and packaging. IEDs may be buried in the road surface or placed on the side of the road. Concealment may include rubbish, animal carcasses, soil, rocks, metal sheets, guardrails, concrete, foams or other materials. A future program may include the foll owing Technical Objectives:  (a) Full definition of operating principles, underlying physics, interoperability and safety hazard mitigation required for military use. (b) Test and evaluation of an existing or modified (if needed) prototype to address the p erformance objectives. (c) Integration of a prototype into a selected GFE military ground vehicle or  manned/unmanned platform to assess performance. (d) Production of one or more refined prototypes for final testing. Contractors who desire to participate in this market survey are encouraged to submit a white paper outlining the IED detection approach and related information.  White papers should discuss a specific existing prototype design and its principles of operation, identify the types of IEDs that the technology can defeat, discuss available experiment or test evidence supporting a TRL 5 or greater m aturity level, and provide experiment or test references.

<SUBJECT>B--Notice of Intent to Make a Sole Source Award to PBS&J, Miami, FL
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (MMS), Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement.  The purpose of this notice is to announce the intent to award a contract on a sole source basis to PBS&J (Post, Buckley, Schuh & Jernigan, Inc.), Miami, FL, in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The MMS anticipates awarding a contract to PBS&J for a Post Hurricane Assessment of Sensitive Habitats on the East Flower Garden Banks Vicinity, located in the Gulf of Mexico approximately 110 miles Southeast of Galveston, TX.  This study is time sensitive in that damage done to the habitat by the Hurricane becomes harder to detect as time passes because of overgrowth by algae and other organisms. Bleached corals usually recover if stress is alleviated.  Bleached corals on the Banks need to be identified and tracked to determine recovery success.  PBS&J has recently performed initial post-hurricane assessments at the Flower Garden Banks making the PBS&J Dive Team familiar with the habitat and techniques.  This study effort is anticipated to be 18 months at a cost of $300,000.   This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  This notice of intent is for informational purposes only.  However, any information received by the Point of Contact (POC) listed below, by Close of Business on January 3, 2006, will be considered by the Government.  POC:  Debra Bridge, MMS, Procurement Operations Branch, 381 Elden Street, MS-2101, Herndon, VA  20170. Questions must be emailed to debra.bridge@mms.gov or faxed to Debra Bridge at (703) 787-1041.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Exception to Fair Opportunity (FAR 16.5)
<DESC>This serves as a “Notice of Intent” to award a sole source task order for Gentran EDI product suite. under the NIH ECS II contract, pursuant to FAR 16.5 (exception to Fair Opportunity).  The General Services Administration Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) has a requirement to establish an ancillary environment (development/test/production tiers) for translation software to process EDI transactions using a product that is scalable to handle the demands of both our internal and external customers across the continental United States. The system must be capable of ensuring secure transactions and to be expandable to process XML capabilities.   The Gentran product manufactured by Sterling Commerce was originally purchased in 1995, and currently supports the existing environment.  Since the original installation in 1995 (ten years ago) the need to add an ancillary environment (development/test/production tiers) has been established on the basis of disaster/ recovery planning.  The current environment consists of only one production machine—a single point of failure.  In the event of a catastrophe, the Government would experience severe hardships trying to recover financial transaction without a backup, mirrored environment.  Therefore a mirrored environment is required.  Since the Gentran product suite is already in-house and has been for over 10 years, it is necessary to continue using the existing product suite. That is, the Office of the Chief Information Officer has already determined that the Gentran product suite meets current operating needs, and there is no requirement to incur additional costs to convert to a new environment.  Substitution of Gentran products with an alternative product would defeat the purpose of establishing a mirrored (exact duplicate) environment.  Substitution would als jeopardize interoperability and compatibility efforts within the agency and impair activities from meeting their current mission requirements.  There are literally thousands of programmer hours invested in the current environment.  The cost of trying to replace an entire EDI/EC translation software package would be far more costly and incur unnecessary risk at this time.  It is essential that the development/test/production environment mirror the current environment that has been in operation for 10 years.  All interested parties may communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Holly Carr 202-329-7250, email:  holly.carr@gsa.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This notice is a sole source combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a sole source Request for Quotations (RFQ) for  Chemwatch Internet Chemical Database (Quantity=1 JOB):   Period of Performance: 2 years from start of contract   Quarterly Updates   Chemwatch CD Rom System for NASA   Validated chemical information by the independent research of  Chemwatch.   Follow-on to contract NNK04EC29P	 The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 2005-06. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 541511 and $23.1 million respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. This is a sole source acquisition to Global Chemical Data, Inc. (doing business as ChemWatchNA) for the following reasons: The Chemwatch product is needed as it would be considerably more expensive to go with another vendor as we would have to not only buy but deploy and train a completely new system NASA-wide.  This system has been used since 2002 NASA wide and there is great familiarity and use of the information for occupational health and emergency response.  Any different system would be more expensive to implement, as there would be a considerable learning period associated with same.  This requirement was last renewed on order NNK04EC29P. The other requirement we must have, and is unique to this vendor, is the validated chemical information by the independent research of Chemwatch.	 Although there are many vendors that provide a on-line chemical database and Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) service, Global Chemical’s Chemwatch was the only provider that went beyond a mere compilation of manufacturer’s data but provided their own validated chemical information of the research.  This is absolutely necessary as there are many errors and gaps in information in vendor supplied MSDS’, which could delay medical treatment in case of an accident.  The NASA medical and environmental community needs to have this validation for emergency medical treatment for accidents and injuries with chemicals. This is a follow on to a previous contract therefore further market research was not conducted.  The cost of buying a new system will outweigh any potential savings as a result of competition.	The manufacture of this product does not use any distributors; therefore they are the only available source. Any other responsible sources may submit an offer providing adequate information to determine equivalency and a forseeable savings to the Government and this shall be considered by the agency.   Delivery to KSC is required within 30 days ARO.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9. Offers for the items(s) described above are due by 4:30 PM EDT/ 1/13/06 to Emily M. Unbehaun/OP-OS NASA John F. Kennedy Space Center, FL 32899 or email to emily.m.unbehaun@nasa.gov and must include, solicitation number, FOB destination to this Center, proposed delivery schedule, discount/payment terms, warranty duration (if applicable), taxpayer identification number (TIN), identification of any special commercial terms, and be signed by an authorized company representative.
