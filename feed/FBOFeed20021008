<DESC>Economic progress in the Philippines has been impeded by population pressure.  The imbalance in population and economic growth is a significant factor in the continuing prevalence of absolute and relative poverty and the failure to attain the desired levels of health improvements.  As a consequence, infectious and communicable diseases, particularly tuberculosis, remain significant health problems, even as degenerative diseases are rising and increasing in significance. Studies show that it will be very difficult for the Philippines to achieve its Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for poverty reduction even if the economy achieves its medium ?term economic growth targets ?unless a concerted population management program is put in place to check the prevailing high population growth rate.? Family planning and health programs in the Philippines are provided by local government units (LGUs) as mandated under the Philippine Local Government Code. However, these LGUs still lack the necessary management capability, technical skills and resources to effectively serve the poor in their communities.

In support of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines? (GRP?s) efforts, USAID/Philippines proposes to implement a ?Health Enhancing Local Partnerships (H.E.L.P)? program under its Strategic Objective of  ?Desired family size and improved health sustainably achieved?. The solicitation, when issued, will seek proposals to provide technical assistance to strengthen the Local Government Units? (LGUs) delivery and management of services for family planning, maternal and child health, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS preventive measures. In particular, the program will support the intermediate result (IR) 1 of the above Strategic Objective: ?LGU provision and management of FP/MCH/TB/HIV/AIDS services strengthened? and its sub-intermediate results.  The program will be comprised of components similar to the following:

a.	local government executive action for family planning and health;
b.	increased financing of health services at the local level;
c.	improved management and provision of heath services at the local level;
d.	segmentation of public sector clientele; and,
e.	local government procurement of health commodities.

USAID anticipates awarding a cost-reimbursable contract for the 3-year program beginning on or about April 2003.  Detailed information about this solicitation is contained in the RFP that will be available on or about November 15, 2002. The closing date for submission of the proposals, to be specified in the RFP, will be about 45 days thereafter.   To obtain the RFP, send your written requests to the Office of Regional Procurement, USAID/Philippines, PSC 502 Box 1, FPO AP 96515-1200 or Office of Regional Procurement, USAID/Philippines, 8/F PNB Financial Center, Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City 1308, Philippines. You may also send your requests by e-mail to marenas@usaid.gov referencing the above RFP. Our telephone nos. are (632) 552-9926 and (632) 552-9924. Our fax nos. are: (632) 551-9297 and (632) 552-9999. The preferred method of distribution of USAID Acquisition and Assistance (A&A) information is via the internet. By exception, USAID can provide the solicitation on a 3.5 floppy disk (MS Word 97 format), via e-mail, or in hard copy. The notice can be viewed and downloaded using this website. The solicitation, once issued, can also be downloaded from this website. You are encouraged to access the solicitation via the internet as this eliminates possible delays associated with mailing in general, and from overseas Missions, in particular. As the recipient of this pre-solicitation notice, you are responsible for ensuring that you have received it from the internet in its entirety. USAID bears no responsibility for data errors resulting from transmission or conversion processes. Further, be aware that amendments to solicitations may be issued and will be posted on the same internet site from which you downloaded the solicitation. Generally the Contracting Officer will issue amendments to all those who have sent in the written confirmation of solicitation receipt. However, USAID does not guarantee that an amendment will be issued to you directly based upon written confirmation that you have downloaded the solicitation from the internet.

<DESC>Administer the Primavera project scheduling system (with upgrade to P3e version), including update existing projects, input new projects, maintain historical project data, provide project information, and provide user support in operation of the system on an ongoing basis.  This also includes facilitation of monthly project status update meetings, management of resource pool data, incorporation of actual time charged to activities from time and attendance records, update or modify report structures for the system output, maintain and update the CFLHD P3 Procedures Manual, regularly assess the system operation and implement process improvements that are desired by the users, and provide technical guidance and assistance to the users in operation of the system.  It is estimated that the work will initially require between 150 and 250 hours per month, with an average of approximately 200 work hours per month (excluding holidays, leave, training, etc.).  The work will be accomplished by the key P3 system administrator and/or other personnel, with the majority of the work, not less than 130 hours per month, required to be performed onsite at the CFLHD office.  The number of personnel, and/or hours per month required may change in the future, depending on the extent of services needed by CFLHD to fully accomplish the tasks listed below.

Description of Work

The following tasks generally describe the work:

1.	Regularly update the existing project schedule and resource database.  Project updates are currently done on a monthly cycle; however this activity may be done in the future on a biweekly or possibly 3-week cycle if the update process could be performed much more efficiently, e.g. with the planned P3e upgrade.  Although the capability exists for the system users to input project data directly, this procedure is not currently utilized.  The data for the regular update will be retrieved from the CFLHD eight Project Managers and approximately twenty functional managers and sub-team leaders.  The project scheduling system may be expanded in the future to include additional construction and technology transfer activities with increased number of activities, resources and users involved in each project.  With planned upgrade of the system to P3e the effort for this task may possibly be done more frequently, or reduced and redirected to the other tasks.  The goal of this task is to keep all system information current, accurate and meaningful, yet minimize the time and effort required from the users to do so.
2.	Input new projects into the system.  Maintain, update and utilize approximately five standard templates for creation of new projects.  Assign either generic resources or specific resources that may be identified.  Establish initial schedules, check and verify logical sequence of activities, and modify as necessary to meet the project objectives using information and feedback from the Project Manager and functional team leaders.  The project scope of activities and schedule is typically described in an interagency project agreement.  The goal of this task is to continuously improve the process for entering new projects for the users, and capture their input as efficiently as possible, to correctly model the proposed project development process.
3.	Maintain the completed project historical database.  As projects are completed maintain them in an inactive status such that historic information can be readily retrieved for comparison with similar proposed projects, track historical trends, resource utilization, activity durations, etc.
4.	Facilitate monthly P3 project status meetings.  In preparation for the status meetings, identify activities and schedule or resource issues that may be of concern.   Assist the users group by facilitating their discussion and resolution of project delivery activities and issues pertaining to project delivery schedules, resources, and activity interrelationships that are modeled in the system.  Project delivery issues that are not directly related to P3 will be resolved through CFLHD?s own leadership. 
5.	Incorporate employee time and attendance records into the P3 system to capture resource hours applied to project activities.  
6.	Update or modify the output report structures that summarize and present project information, multi-project data summaries, and historic data for analysis of individual projects, groups of projects, and the entire project delivery program.  The report structures are customized for various types of users and management levels.  With the planned implementation of P3e, simplified reporting structures may be available to the users, and some of the effort involved in this task may be reduced in the future and possibly redirected to the other tasks.
7.	Develop, maintain and update performance measurements that are tracked using the P3 database, such as periodic comparison of baseline projections versus actual activity completion dates, durations, resource utilization, and other indicators.  CFLHD currently measures performance indicators on a quarterly basis.
8.	Maintain and update the CFLHD P3 Procedures Manual.  Document all input and output reporting processes.  Perform short term and long term backups of the P3 database
9.	Regularly assess the system operation and identify process improvements that would be of value to CFLHD, or implement process improvements that are desired by the users.
10.	Provide technical guidance, informal training, and general assistance to the users in operation of the system, as requested.

<ARCHDATE>11202002
<CONTACT>hugh harrison 301-227-1123
<DESC>NA The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends to procure  a video recording and three-dimensional analysis system to capture and analyze the motion of a variety of marine test articles in surface and underwater environments. This requirement  is a 100% small business set-aside and will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract utilizing FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. Both full-scale and model-scale test articles are used as targets.  Examples of dynamics and parameters to be analyzed include position, pitch, roll, yaw, speed, acceleration, displacement, cavitation, volume, reaction to explosive events and correlation between momentary cavitation events and acoustic events.  Based on the limit of the system's recording capacity, it must be able to operate over a range of speeds (frames/second) and time periods. Three (3) colo r imagers will typically be used.The imagers must be able to be remotely controlled so that the operator can make adjustments to frame rates, aperture, shutter speeds, triggering method, and so forth, and have "through the lens" viewing capability, all from the remote workstation. Once the imagers have been positioned and connected, they must be locked together for a global trigger signal and synchronized recording of the event.  NSWCCD requires 2 seconds of record time at the highest frame rate of 1,000 frames/second.  The frame rate must be proportionally adjustable (lower) thereby providing increased recording time.  Due to the size of the objects being tested and some testing being performed underwater, a high-resolution camera sensor with adequate light sensitivity will be critical. Due to the nature of testing, the imagers must be capable of retaining those images in the  camera's memory until they are remotely downloaded to the workstation or other storage device subsequent to the test.  The imagers can be located a maximum of 100 feet from each other so Ethernet or similar industry standard communication technology is required.  Upon completion of a test, the operator must be able to rapidly download the imagers and secure the data on the workstation's RAID.  Due to typically short intervals between tests, the system must completely download the three imagers and secure the data within 30 minutes.Saved images must be available for review and edit.  This includes playback, fast forward and reverse, freeze frame, advance by frame (forward or reverse), and a zoom window feature.  Image sequences must be able to be edited for length (deletion of frames).  Additional digital image filters such as brightness, contrast, edge enhancement, etc. are be neficial. The workstation shall contain 2D and 3D motion analysis software, which will allow the operator to select points of interest in the imagery and generate time/position plots on a 2D or 3D coordinate system.  Point types should include positive and negative contrast points, quadrant target fiducials and the ability for the operator to select and create custom point templates.  The software will automatically locate the centroid of the selected point or match the custom template.  The software will be able to auto-track these points throughout the image sequence and possess sub-pixel resolution properties. The motion analysis software will have the ability to import external sensor I/O data.  The operator may select single or multiple channels of sensor data, create sensor data plots and synchronize the resultant plots with the imagery. The 3D software will have an inte rface, which will prompt the user through the necessary steps to successfully complete 3D geometry calibration and lens correction. 3D plots will appear in a Cartesian "world view" format such that the operator can select the orientation of the coordinate system. All plots must be able to be displayed in graphical and tabular format and be exportable in an industry-standard format to other third party programs for additional analysis. The software must be able to create an electronic version of the test results and be able to write that to compact disk (CD) so that the recipient can play the imagery and view the test results on any industry standard PC. The workstation must have adequate processing and storage capability to be able to store at least 10 complete and uncompressed tests. The RFQ for this announcement will be issued on or about Oct 22,2002.  To receive a copy  of the RFQ please submit your request to Hugh Harrison by email harrisonhl@nswccd.navy.mil, or by fax to 301-227-1847,  NOT LATER THAN Oct 22, 2002.  (See note #1)

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) N00421-02-R-3258.
BACKGROUND:  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Crew Systems Department, Patuxent River, Maryland, is currently in the process of developing a Decision Support System (DSS) for implementation in next-generation tactical aircraft.  It is envisioned that the DSS will provide three levels of support.  First, the DSS will dynamically reconfigure the cockpit displays and controls such that only those functions required for the current tasks will be provided (i.e., adaptive pilot-vehicle interface).  Second, the DSS will provide the course-of-action options available to the pilots at the decisions points in the tactical missions.  Third, the DSS will temporarily automate secondary flight tasks during periods of high pilot workload so the pilots can focus on the mission-critical tasks (i.e., adaptive automation).  In order to provide these three levels of support, cognitive-based models will be incorporated in the design of the DSS.  These models will assess the current flight task, pilot workload, aircraft state, and threat level, and then trigger the appropriate pilot-vehicle interface, decision options, and cockpit automation.

BAA PURPOSE:  This BAA is to solicit proposals for the following cognitive modeling technologies: (1) new, innovative human cognitive models for use as DSS intelligent agents; (2) innovative workload models; (3) innovative mission-context models; and (4) adaptive automation (AA) algorithms including unique approaches to triggering AA and handling uncertainty in AA systems.  Several of the more promising technologies will be selected and funded to determine if they can be successfully adapted to the DSS.  We are especially interested in newer cognitive modeling approaches that have high potential but are not fully mature or have not necessarily been employed in this domain.

BAA PRODUCTS:  Products of this BAA shall be: (1) technical reports describing in detail the specific structure and dynamics of the models along with explicit directions for incorporating the models in the NAWCAD DSS, and (2) the delivery of the model software that includes all source code and documentation.  License agreements between the U.S. Navy and the successful bidders will be established to protect the commercial property rights for the respective cognitive models.  Tasks under this BAA are expected to be performed between a minimum of three months and a maximum of 12 months.

BAA RESPONSE:  Responses to this BAA will be accepted anytime within twelve (12) months from the date this announcement appears in the Commerce Business Daily.  EARLY SUBMISSION IS HIGHLY ENCOURAGED.  Proposals will be evaluated (and possibly awarded) as they are received. The proposal should include a clear statement of objectives, description of technical approach, detail description of technical tasks, program schedule and detail milestones, description of any cost sharing to be undertaken by the offeror, an overview of related experience, biographical section describing the education, experience, capabilities and scientific interest of key researchers, and a detail cost section. The offeror shall provide backup information to support the quoted price (e.g. a copy of the current catalog or established price list, three invoices for the same or similar item/service, etc.). The cost of preparation for the response to this BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to the resulting contract or any contract.  Technical proposals should be limited to 25 pages. Original plus three (3) copies of each proposal should be provided.  Responses should be broken into two volumes; Volume I ? Technical and Volume II Cost.  Cost should be broken out on a task-by-task basis.

EVALUATION/SELECTION CRITERIA:  The evaluation/selection of potentially one or more sources for contract award will be conducted by a panel of government experts based on the following prioritized criteria: (1) innovative approaches to the four cognitive modeling technologies described above, (2) integration of the proposed approach with the Navy?s tactical Decision Support System (DSS), (3) offeror?s past performance on similar efforts, analytical capabilities, facilities, and (4) realism of proposed costs. 

AWARD:  Initial contract award (s) is anticipated between 30 September 2002 through 30 September 2003.  Cost plus fix fee contract type is anticipated.  Other types of contracts may be proposed, however, offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept.  Final decision on award type will be made by the Government.  Awards will be subject to availability of funds.

POC:  For further information offerors are encouraged to contact, Dr. Norman Warner/ Senior Scientist, for clarification of the technical issues and cost response format.  Offerors are cautioned that only the Contracting Officer is legally authorized to commit the Government and award a Government contract.  Dr. Warner can be reached at Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Crew Systems Department, Patuxent River, MD 20670, Phone: (301) 342-9288, Fax: (301) 342-9305 or E-mail: warnernw@navair.navy.mil.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR Orlando) Training Systems Division intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a Sole Source contract with The Boeing Company, St. Louis, MO under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."  

Background:  Under a three-year lease agreement, Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) has been using the Transportable Training Technology Demonstrator (TTTD) provided by The Boeing Company under NAVAIR contract N61339-98-C-0008 at the NAF Atsugi, Japan since May 1999.  The current contract period and associated lease ended May 2002.  All logistical support associated with the Boeing TTTD (spares, documentation) is solely provided by Boeing. The Navy intends to install the Boeing TTTD onboard the USS Kitty Hawk for approximately one year from November 2002 to November 2003 in order to collect research data relative to usability of deployable trainers.  

Proposed Tasking: This task consists of moving the Boeing TTTD from the NAF Atsugi and installing it onboard the USS Kitty Hawk. The contractor shall be responsible for  hooking up the trainer to the ship's electrical power supply and conducting testing to ensure device functionality.  The contractor shall also include the price for a one-year lease of the Boeing TTTD and the terms and conditions of that lease.  The contractor shall provide maintenance support via telephone and email as has been done for the past three years.  It is expected that the Boeing TTTD will be onboard the USS Kitty Hawk from Nov 2002 until Nov 2003. Collection of data while on deployment will commence following the successful installation of the Boeing TTTD. An integral part of the plan is to collect data on the suitability and usability of the trainer onboard the aircraft carrier.  The data collected will be used to improve the utility of future deployed aviation training systems.  

Because the contract requires in-depth knowledge of the current design, award through competition would require substantial duplication of cost that the Government would not recover through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the F/A-18's mission requirements.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, pricing, and any other information, which demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the above address (Attn: Caron L. Rigali) by October 23, 2003.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Responses shall be limited to no more than FIVE pages.  This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice.

<CONTACT>DENIS S. THARP, Contract Specialist, Phone: 513-487-2092, E-Mail: Tharp.Scott@epa.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 12 and Part 13 Commercial and Simplified procedures, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency seeks contractors to provide Embedded Control Development using LabView.  This is a Small Business Set-Aside. Recently written on-highway heavy-duty diesel exhaust emissions regulations for 2007 and beyond were greatly strengthened by successful demonstration of state of the art hardware and controls at the NVFEL EPA facilities.  EPA effectively demonstrated that 0.2 grams NOx/hp-hr could be achieved on a mid-range, modern diesel engine utilizing exhaust aftertreatment (SAE papers 2001-01-1351, 2001-01-3619, 2002-01-2871).  While the system has been tested in a ?proof of concept? system, much development remains to make the system ready for use in a vehicle. The work completed to date has separated the emission control system (ECS) algorithms from the engine controller.  In order to take advantage of the synergies available between the engine and ECS, the ECS and engine control algorithms should be combined.  Engine operation can then be modified in such a way to be beneficial to the operation of the ECS.  The benefits include faster catalyst light-off and the improvements in NOx adsorber desulfurization. EPA is interested in developing integrated engine and ECS control algorithms to investigate the performance and emissions of the combined systems.  This project will be conducted in close collaboration with the EPA ASD.   Specifically, this project will be divided into two phases.  The first phase is a planning phase and the second phase is the implementation.  The second phase is optional. If exercised, the second option will culminate in the hardware, software, installation, set-up, debug, training, and programming techniques being provided to the EPA to integrate the engine and ECS systems. PHASE 1:  PLANNING Development System Identification  1A  This contractor shall identify the tool chain required to fulfill EPA?s need for a LabView based control development.   1B  The contractor shall expand on the capability of EPA?s current National Instruments hardware (LabView) by providing a dynamic plant simulation, rapid prototyping and embedded control capability.   1C  The contractor shall use the identified tool chain and provide compatibility with the ?hooks? available in the Bosch engine control software.  The compatability shall allow modification to the EGR control and injection timing/pressure algorithms, etc. that may be beneficial to the ECS.   1D  The contractor shall specifically identify any hardware, software, and special programming techniques required to develop the required tool chain. PHASE 2:  IMPLEMENTATION (OPTIONAL) Purchase of Development System Components   2A  The contractor shall implement the development of the tool chain.   2B  The contractor shall provide all hardware, software, and special programming techniques required to develop the required tool chain. 2C  The contractor shall install/setup/debug and provide training at EPA NVFEL. DURATION: Phase 1 shall be completed by November 30, 2002 Phase 2 shall be completed two (2) months after exercise of the option. MATERIALS: EPA requires that the contractor(s) supply all materials for this project.  DELIVERABLES: PHASE 1:  The contractor shall deliver two (2) copies of a detailed plan for the  fully functional embedded control development tool chain.  One (1) copy shall be submitted to the Project Officer and the other plan shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer. PHASE 2:  The contractor shall deliver all hardware, software, and special 	programming techniques required to develop a fully functional embedded control development tool chain.  The contractor shall also install/setup/debug and provide training at EPA NVFEL.  Sources wishing to be submit a competitive proposal must indicate a written interest to the office identified above.  Documentation must be received by October 15, 2002.  EPA intends to have the RFQ clos on October 28, 2002, due to the time sensitivity of the requirement.  Submit your request in writing to Scott Tharp by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  TELEPHONE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE HONORED.  SEE NOTE 1.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The United States Environmental Protection Agency, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures of FAR Part 13, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to International Resources Group (IRG), Ltd., of Washington, D.C.  The EPA has begun to develop a U.S. national data base for MARKAL (a data-driven energy systems economic optimization model) by collecting and analyzing data on energy systems and technologies and storing this information in a retrievable data base.  The purpose of this purchase is to complete development of the data base to enable beginning  an environmental/economic modeling effort using MARKAL. This acquisition is a two-fold effort: develop a credible industrial database for the MARKAL model; and validate and enhance the use of a multicriteria decisionmaking algorithm known as goal programming.   Mr. Gary Goldstein of IRG is uniquely  qualified to perform this requirement because he is one of the primary developers of the MARKAL model, and is presently the coordinator for the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Program (ETSAP).  He is, therefore, able to provide assistance in the computational and theoretical underpinnings of the  model and its database development, in the data needs and data format of the model, and in its application.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541620.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATION IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is capable of meeting the EPA's requirements  stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 10 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered.  Interested firms shall provide detailed information outlining their capabilities--any response failing to provide the aforementioned data will be disregarded.   Responses to this posting must be in writing.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  PROPOSALS ARE NOT REQUIRED AT THIS TIME AND WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  THE SOLICITATION IS EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED DURING THE LAST WEEK IN NOVEMBER 2002.

The U.S. Marine Corps has a requirement for an Aircraft Integrated Maintenance System (AIMS) and related supplies and services for the CH-46E aircraft. The primary components of AIMS will be desktop software application, onboard Processor Unit, a Display Unit, Optical Rotor Tracker, Vibration Sensors, cable assemblies and miscellaneous aircraft installation components. AIMS will be the consolidation and integration of existing support equipment functions including rotor track and balance (Chadwick-Helmuth 8500C), vibration monitoring (Chadwick-Helmuth 14235), vibration analysis (Chadwick-Helmuth 14235), engine data acquisition (Howell H337NP600) and engine performance analysis (Howell H337NP600).

AIMS, when installed in the CH-46E aircraft, will provide for integrated rotor track and balance capability, continuous monitoring of vibration levels of all dynamic components and engine performance parameters. AIMS will also provide for future implementation of aircrew in-flight warnings for basic vibration exceedances and engine parameter exceedances. AIMS data will be downloaded to a desktop software application for additional data analysis, trending and storage. AIMS will be user configurable to the extent required for vibration alarming and initializing aircraft configurations. The benefits of an onboard monitoring system include the preservation of aircraft structure and electronic components life, tremendous reductions in maintenance man-hours due to enhanced trouble shooting /fault isolation and the elimination of ground support equipment requirements. The requirement includes the aircraft kits, ancillary hardware, and engineering services necessary to upgrade CH-46E aircraft.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is not a modification, but instead provides a list of questions and answers for this soliciation:

QUESTION #1:  The document type is noted as a presolicitation notice, and a link is shown at the bottom of the web page to register to receive notification.  Does this mean that a final solicitation notice is to be expected.  If so, when will this be done and will this notice contain further detailed information and terms-of-reference of which the submission should address.  I registered to receive notification on the presolicitation document but have not received anything.

ANSWER #1:  A solicitation notice is not forthcoming.  As stated in the announcement, firms must submit 254s and 255s by COB (5:00PM) Tuesday, October 29, 2002.  I have received no registrations and the notification an email address for receipt of questions.

QUESTION #2:  Are general references, with name, title, organization, telephone #, etc, (not project specific, as allowed for in SF 254) to be submitted, for the prime consultant, joint venture partners and subconsultants?

ANSWER #2:  Yes, as reflected in Item 4, Past Performance is an evaluation factor and will be evaluated.  Your submission should incorporate enough information to ensure proper evaluation.

QUESTION #3:  The presolicitation notice states that FTA is seeking qualified firms or organizations to provide A/E services? and further states, The firms selected for contract award will be licensed Architect and Engineering firms.... I have not heard of a firm being licensed as an A/E firm, only individuals.  

ANSWER #3: The FTA Project Management Oversight Program contracts are awarded consistent with Public Law 92-582,  The Brooks Act:  Federal Government Selection of Architects and Engineers.  As described in Section 901-Definitions:  The term firm means any individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the professions of architecture or engineering.  The FTA presolicitation notice solicits legal entities permitted by law to practice the profession.

QUESTION #4:  If a management firm joint ventures with an A/E firm, will that qualify for the statement in your presolicitation notice The firms selected for contract award will be licensed A/E firms....engineering in nature?

ANSWER #4:  Yes.  If the form of organization meets the requirements provided in Answer #3 above.    


QUESTION #5:  How are PMOs and FMOs contractors selected?  Are federal procurement policies with respect to full and open competition practiced?  If not, why not?

ANSWER #5:  PMO contracts are awarded consistent with Public Law 92-582 The Brooks Act and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36 for firms providing Architect and Engineering services.  Full and open competition is practiced for obtaining registered or licensed A&E firms that meet the FTA solicitation requirements.  Competition under an A&E award does not include cost, but is competed on technical expertise.

FMO contracts are awarded under the Small Business Administration?s 8(a) program in accordance with FAR Part 19.  Awards valued below $3M are made on a sole source basis.  This program allows FTA to contract with SBA for the required services. SBA provides these services utilizing their small disadvantaged business concern subcontractors. The amount of each contract award does not allow for competition among the 8(a) firms based on SBA Act.      

QUESTION #6:  What is the cut-off time for receipt of submission of 254s and 255s?

ANSWER #6: Submissions are due by 5:00PM EST on October 29, 2002. 

QUESTION #7:  May firms propose as a prime contractor and a subcontractor for a different firm, or as a subcontractor for numerous firms.

ANSWER#7:  Yes. There are no restrictions of this nature.

QUESTION #8: Is there is size limitation for submissions.

ANSWER #8:  No.

QUESTION #9:  In completing SF 255, assuming that a composite SF 255 is to be submitted, including all subconsultants, what is the limit for the number of projects described in item 8 of the SF 255?

ANSWER #9:  As stated in the instructions, the firm proposed as the prime (or joint venture), must reflect up to ten projects. Subcontractors should also reflect up to ten projects.  

There are no restrictions on the number of pages.

QUESTION #10:  Aside from the cover page/letter and the SF 254s and 255s, is there a limit to the amount of submitted accompanying material that addresses the issues and points noted in the Presolicitation Notice?

ANSWER #11:	No. 


QUESTION #12:  Are IT specialists required to be on the team to address any oversight of projects components that involve this work (e.g. control centers, automatic train control, etc)?  Are safety and security specialists required?

ANSWER #12:	Your proposal should include the disciplines outlined in the presolicitation document.  This does not restrict you from developing your team at this time to meet the requirements of this notice.
 
QUESTION #13:  Will FTA contract for Value Engineering Services directly for this project, independent of the services of the selected A/E firms? Is it expected that each A/E respondent will include a Value Specialist subcontractor as part of its submission package?

ANSWER #13:  Historically FTA has not contracted directly for Value Engineering Services and currently has no plans to do so.  The prime and/or its subcontractors may provide Value Engineering Services.

QUESTION #14:  The announcement says, Each firm must have personnel for each of the following disciplines.  Does FTA require each of the prime firms to have all the required disciplines or each Team, including the subconsultants to have all the required disciplines?

ANSWER #14:  Each team.  Similarly, see also answer 13.

QUESTION #15:  Does the Required Disciplines list end with the sentence ending with structural engineering?

ANSWER #15:  Yes.

QUESTION #16:  FTA states Services also include fact finding studies.  Investigation and economic analysis....  Investigation and economic analysis in evaluation of assessment of design requirements can be provided by a broad set of expertise.  Does the FTA require a specific type of professional expertise in this area?

ANSWER #16:  Task Orders will identify the specific work.  The specific expertise needed will be geared to the work when assigned.  

QUESTION #17:  Past performance within the last five years:  Does it apply to the prime and the subconsultants?

ANSWER #17:  This applies to the prime contractor.  Please note that prime contractors are obligated to determine its subcontractors as responsible in accordance with the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation(FAR) Parts 9 Contractor Responsibility, and 44 Subcontracting Policies and Procedures, prior to submitting for government approval.

QUESTION #18:  How many references are required for each firm?

ANSWER #18:  A minimum of 5 (five)

QUESTION #19:  For the ten projects requested in question 8 of the SF 255, should these be for the prime only, for both prime and subconsultants or can an additional ten projects be shown for the other firms. 

ANSWER #19:  The prime contractor must list up to 10 projects.  Subcontractors may reflect up to 10 projects as well.

QUESTION #20:  As a small firm I cannot meet all of the required disciplines and experience required by the solicitation.  Can you advise me if (a) my submittal will make my firm's name, capabilities and experience available to other firms responding to the solicitation as a possible subcontractor (b) Are there small or specific tasks which my small firm may be able to qualify for independently? And (c) Is there a list of firms and contact persons interested in the subject solicitation that may be available to me so that I can contact them directly regarding a joint venture or subcontract relationship?

ANSWER #20:  Your submittal and information will not be shared with other firms competing for this requirement, but instead will be safeguarded to ensure that competitors are not known.  As stated in the solicitation document there are subcontracting opportunities for small, small disadvantaged and woman-owned firms under this requirement.  Once contracts are awarded FTA can provide you with a list of those firms we have contracted with and can also provide you with a list of the firms currently under contract so that you may solicit subcontracting opportunities.

QUESTION #21:  Are technical proposal required along with the Cover Letter and Standard Forms 254 and 255s?

ANSWER #21:  No.  However, you should ensure that each evaluation factor, subfactor and sub-subfactor is addressed in your proposal. 

QUESTION #22:  Please clarify whether subcontractors in addition to the prime are required to submit both SF 254 and SF 255.

ANSWER #22:  The Standard Forms are required for subcontractors that are proposed for the required disciplines.

There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response. As a civilian agency of the U.S. Department of Defense, DoDEA operates 224 public schools in 21 districts located in 14 foreign countries, seven states, Guam, and Puerto Rico with approximately 8,800 teachers serving 106,000 students.  The purpose of this Sources Sought is to identify sources who can conduct a study of the alignment of educational assessments to educational standards.  DoDEA is interested in conducting a study of the alignment of three math assessments currently used in the system to their math standards.  The main focus of the study would be to answer the research question, "To what extent are the DoDEA math standards at grades 4, 8 and 10 assessed by the three DoDEA-adopted mathematics assessments?"  The study will rate the assessments' depth of coverage of each of the math standards at grades 4, 8 and 10.  Additionally, standards from grades 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 11 will be used to determine the assessments' breadth of coverage throughout the mathematics instructional program.  The study will also determine what, if any, gaps exist between the assessment and the standards.  At some additional time, this same type of study will be required for DoDEA's reading/language arts standards and assessments.  This is a Sources Sought Notice for MARKET RESEARCH ONLY.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME.  Responses shall include your company's name, statement of capabilities, and the current names, addresses and phone numbers of past performance references.  For additional information contact: Kristen Medhurst,  703/696-4471 ext.1930.

  DESCRIPTION: QUANTITY: 300 MX. 
1. General- The following codes shall be used to identify the side of the tag being described:

1 a. Bid must include cost of application pliers.
1 b. Bid must be submitted to USDA/APHIS with a bid  sample of  the tag.

    The tags shall be of durable non-tissue reactive plastic and be no longer or heavier than the currently approved SFCP flap tag with a maximum size of 3.5 cm wide by 3.5 cm high and shall not cause the ear to droop when applied. The plastic shall not break or crack upon application of the ear tag and should be sufficiently flexible to minimize breakage or loss during routine sheep and goat management procedures. It is extremely desirable that the tag design be one that has already been proven suitable for extensive and intensive sheep and goat production management systems. Sheep program tags shall be pure white plastic and the meat-only tags shall be light blue in color. 
 
3. Closure Specifications: 
   The tags shall be of self-piecing and self-locking design. The tag shall have a sharpened tip Side three (3) and will penetrate the animal's ear during the process of closing. Side three (3) shall lock through side two (2), and shall not protrude more than 5/16 of an inch above the inside surface plane of side two (2), after locking and must not have any rough surfaces.  In addition, the female side of the tag should be constructed in such a manner that any tampering or unauthorized removal of the tag with the intent to place it in another animal would cause sufficient damage to the tag to make it readily obvious or unusable.

4. Printing Specifications:
   The printing shall be large enough to permit easy legibility at three (3) to five (5) feet distance.
The tag size should be adequate to accommodate a seven 7)character alphanumeric premises identification and a consecutively numbered individual animal ID sequence, or an eight (8) character alphanumeric serial number. These are unique numbers and shall not be duplicated.  Side one (1) must accommodate the letters "US" enclosed in the government shield, the manufacture's logo, premises ID number, and the individual animal number.  The numbers and letters are assigned by each state and they will change from delivery order to delivery order.  All characters shall be Helvetica bold ten (10) point, very large font lettering style. All characters are laser embedded into the plastic.  The lettering and base color must be non-fading during the expected ten (10) year life of the tag.      

 5. Performance Specifications:
    The tags must have an established record of reliability in animals, preferably sheep and goats.
Manufactures with data supporting tag durability, the durability and legibility of the identification numbers, and a high level of long-term retention with minimal adverse effects to the animal's ears may be given preference. In addition, the tag manufacture(s) must comply with the requirements set forth in 9 CFR part 79.2(f) for approved ear tag manufactures. Data must be entered into the
web page and tags must be shipped within two (2) weeks of receipt of the order. Manufacturer must enter tag information into the APHIS tag web page for each order and access the delivery address through the web page.
