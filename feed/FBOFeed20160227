<DESC>NSN 1R-1680-016219095-P8, REF NR 417A5701-180CP, QTY 110 EA, DELIVERY FOB ORIGIN. NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) intends to solicit the Boeing Company (81205) for the purchase of items associated with the P-8A Poseidon
aircraft platform. NAVSUP WSS' intention is to award a Firm Fixed Price
contract. Although the Navy intends in the future to obtain competition wherever feasible for the subject items (generally referred to as common commercial
parts), key logistics/support data essential to competition is not currently
available. Specifically, essential provisioning data and engineering/technical  data necessary for manufacture and acceptance of the subject parts (initially   developed for the 737 aircraft by Boeing Commercial Aircraft or its commercial  sub-vendors) is not available to the Navy. In addition, Critical Safety Item
(CSI)/Critical Application Item (CAI) determinations for the P-8A continue to be made and life limits assessed, including for commercial common parts. Given such circumstances, at present, purchases of the listed items will only be made from Boeing the airframe manufacturer, from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), or from authorized distributors (if any) to assure parts integrity given the
P-8A's critical mission and early deployment status. Sources sought:
Notwithstanding the current constraints requiring procurement as noted, once
CSI/CAI determinations are made, and where other necessary engi
neering/technical data becomes available, the Navy will be actively seeking in  the future to maximize the opportunity for competition presented by P-8A comm   ercial common parts. In that regard the following should be noted. The P-8 A is not FAA type certificated. New sources for items determined to be CSI/C AI will therefore require Navy Source Approval prior to award. If you are not a
Navy-approved source, when in the future the Navy has sufficient
engineering/technical data to accept and evaluate source approval requests, you will have to submit, prior to or together with any proposal, the information
detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Brochure which can be obtained on the internet at: https://www.nasup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navsupww/business_opps.  Future offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source
Approval Brochure will not be considered for award. Please note, if evaluation  of a source approval request submitted cannot be processed in time and/or the   approval requirement precludes the ability to obtain the items being procured in time to meet Government requirements, award of the procurement may be conti nued based on Fleet support needs. For information or questions regarding this
notice, please contact Dana Scott at email address dana.scott@navy.mil

<DESC>Background<br />This segment is part of the six-week orientation course for Foreign Service Officers (FSOs).  Since FSOs must be prepared to persuasively answer difficult questions on U.S. policy and society and effectively promote U.S. interests, this course includes an Oral Persuasion element to develop skills and techniques to represent the U.S. government in a variety of Foreign Service situations.  The orientation course will be offered four (4) times in FY2016 and FY2017.  Each class has between 40 and 100 students.  Each oral persuasion workshop will include one plenary presentation between 2.5 and 4 hours long for the entire class, and up to eight small group practical training sessions of four hours each, with each small group meeting twice (giving each student up to 8 hours total of small group instruction, in addition to the plenary session).  For the practical training sessions, each class will be divided into smaller groups of approximately equal size, generally consisting of 8-15 students.  The number of courses offered during the year, the presentation dates, and the number of small group sessions are subject to change or cancellation, with notification of such changes made as early as possible. <br />

<DESC>Context<br />The Department of State's Foreign Service Institute (FSI) is the Federal Government's primary training institution for officers and support personnel of the U.S. foreign affairs community, preparing American diplomats and other professionals to advance U.S. foreign affairs interests overseas and in Washington. <br />The Basic Consular Course (aka "ConGen")-administered by the Consular Training Division of FSI's School of Professional and Area Studies (SPAS)-ensures that all entry level consular professionals acquire the skills that they need to effectively perform their work, which includes ensuring the safety and security of U.S. citizens abroad and the secure, accurate adjudication of passports and visas. This course is taught over a six-week period, up to 47 times each fiscal year, and provides intensive training in immigration and nationality law/regulations, and in consular policies, responsibilities, and procedures. Students have frequent opportunities during the course to practice applying what they have learned in a realistic work environment. Students role play key consular responsibilities, including adjudicating passports and visas, visiting U.S. citizens in prison, responding to natural and man-made crises, and placing a telephone call to notify the next-of-kin of the death of a U.S. citizen. Currently, ConGen students play the supporting roles in each of the role plays-for example, the applicant in the visa interviews, the prisoner in the prison visit, and the next of kin in the death notification role plays.  <br />

Contract VA69D-14-C-0100 expires 1/31/2016 for same services. Vendor, Doctors Oxygen, is the sole authorized service facility for Wisconsin, Northern Illinois and Indiana. No other vendor, serving this region, would have the access to OEM parts or factory training. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: 
Conducted GSA and NAC MedSurg Catalog for NAICS 811219 and anesthesia, no matches were received. Conducted Vetbiz search under NAICS 811219, but found no vendor that could service anesthesia machines with service in Illinois area. SBA dynamic business search located Medical Service Solutions. When contacted, Ms. Hackensmith stated service was only available in Maryland, Washington DC, Virginia and Pennsylvania. A search of FBO found an attempted SDVOSB set-aside from VISN 17. When contacting the contracting officer, Jerry Hyndman, he stated he only received interest from R&M Reyes Enterprises based in Waipahu, Hawaii and Beacon Point & Associates. R&M provides medical equipment but not services. Beacon Point is a service provider of the manufacturer Drager but only provides service in the region of Texas. It was confirmed with Tom Caltabiano of Drager that Doctors Oxygen is the service provider for Northern Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Price is the same as previous contract VA69D-14-C-0100 for the base plus all 4 options. $5,300/year for each of the 9 Apollo machines and $3,900/year for the 4 Fabius-Tiro machines. $63,300 total annually and $316,500 for the base plus 4 options value. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
Conducted GSA and NAC MedSurg Catalog for NAICS 811219 and anesthesia, no matches were received. Conducted Vetbiz search under NAICS 811219, but found no vendor that could service anesthesia machines with service in Illinois area. SBA dynamic business search located Medical Service Solutions. When contacted, Ms. Hackensmith stated service was only available in Maryland, Washington DC, Virginia and Pennsylvania. A search of FBO found an attempted SDVOSB set-aside from VISN 17. When contacting the contracting officer, Jerry Hyndman, he stated he only received interest from R&M Reyes Enterprises based in Waipahu, Hawaii and Beacon Point & Associates. R&M provides medical equipment but not services. Beacon Point is a service provider of the manufacturer Drager but only provides service in the region of Texas. It was confirmed with Tom Caltabiano of Drager that Doctors Oxygen is the service provider for Northern Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  
None

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  
None

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  
Life cycle replacement of the 13 anesthesia machines would bring competition among manufacturers if the decision was made to replace the inventory of machines.
