<DESC>REQUIREMENTS:

The Advanced Acquisition Program (AAP) is a monthly opportunity for offering building space for lease to the Federal Government.  In order to register to participate, participants must first notify the Contracting Officer by email at Tracy.Harter@gsa.gov.  You will be asked to complete an electronic registration form and the Government will notify you by email once a Solicitation for Offers (SFO) is posted.  When you receive this email notification, you can submit your offer.  

Offerors can typically submit offers beginning with the 1st day of the open period every month through the last day of the open period every month.  Typically, the last day of the open period will be the 7th day of every month.  

GSA will be implementing an on-line offer submission web site in the next 60 days in which you will be asked to 
re-register on-line in order to receive future notification of the government’s space needs.  An industry conference to explain the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program will be held in San Antonio no later than July 31, 2006 and everyone that has registered by email or on-line will receive an invitation to attend the industry conference.  Location, date, and time will be provided to you in the email invitation.

The United States Government is seeking to lease, in increments of up to 50,000 BOMA Rentable Square Feet or up to 45,000 ANSI/BOMA Office Area Square Feet, office space to satisfy new lease requirements, compete existing leases for potential replacement, and potential occupancy for short emergency housing lease terms. 

The Government will relocate from existing space under lease if economics involved and other factors prove to be favorable.  The cost of moving, telecommunications, alterations, impact on agency mission and other variables to be determined by the Government, will be considered in the relocation decision in order to determine the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards and/or combine multiple space requirements.

OCCUPANCY:

Space must be ready for commencement of tenant alterations between Summer 2006 and Spring 2007.

DELINEATED AREA:

All properties offered to the Government in conjunction with this requirement must be located within a portion of Bexar County, Texas as further explained in SFO paragraph 1.2 “Area of Consideration”.

LEASE TERM:  UP TO 10 YEARS

Section K–(ORCA) On Line Representations and Certifications - Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov . In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN). The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of  contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.   The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional readonly provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.Thank you, Teresa Sorrenti IAE Program Manager Integrated Acquisition Environment 2011 Crystal Drive,  Crystal Park 1, Suite 911, Arlington, VA 22202 ,  Tel. 703-872-8600  Fax 703-872-8598,email integrated.acquisition@gsa.gov | http:egov.gsa.gov.

<DESC>This requirement is for the  advanced research and development in the area of autonomous power efficiency technology that approaches power management from a just-in-time and just-enough perspective, avoiding the inefficiencies and risks to mission capability inherent in providing maximum power to electronic applications at all times, while allowing for intelligent, autonomous thermal management of densified and/or environmentally isolated electronics that allow for size and weight reductions necessary for a leaner, swifter, more agile fighting force.  The objectives of this project include:  Developing a system-level approach for autonomous power management of electronics systems that rely on a dedicated, remote power source, including the capability to sense the minimum power necessary to operate without a reduction in performance, and the ability to deliver the necessary power to the system components without reductions in the timeliness of system response, while maximizing the conservation of its available energy resources.  Developing a methodology that allows for the automated, real-time, automated determination of the amount of energy needed by an electronics system.  Developing a methodology that allows for the autonomous parametric adjustment of an electronics system (e.g., internal clocks, supply voltages) for the efficient delivery of a level of energy that reduces dynamic power dissipation and suppresses transient power demand.  Developing hardware and software—independent of application, architecture, or packaging—that implement the methodologies developed above, while minimizing the additional size and weight required for the specific power management apparatus.  Demonstrating the potential for reduction in size and weight of systems utilizing such an implementation of at least 50% on each parameter (including any power management hardware) without a reduction of any measurable performance parameter.  In response to the Request for Proposal (RFP), contractors will be required to develop and submit a cost proposal and a Statement of Work/Technical Proposal in response to the previously stated objectives.  This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.  The place of performance will be at the awardee’s facility.  The anticipated duration of this research and development project is 12 months.  Expected award date is on or about 30 September 2006.  Basis for award will be on best value basis with the  evaluation criteria being outlined in Request for Proposal H94003-06-R-0006. RFP will be issued on or about 23 June 2006. For a copy of the RFP or for questions regarding this project, email or fax requests/questions to Linda Baustian at Baustian@dmea.osd.mil or (916)231-2816. See Synopsis Numbered Note  1.

<SUBJECT>23 -- NATO Notification of Intent (NOI) to Invite Bids for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for Procurement of Vehicles and Trailers
<SOLNBR>IFIB-NAMSA-CP-149-156
<RESPDATE>071706

<DESC>The NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to provide bids on the provision of vehicles and trailers for the following two projects:

1. Provide Deployable Non Communication and Information System (CIS) Equipment, which is part of the Capability Package (CP) 0A0149 NATO Deployable Command and Control (C2) Assets  

2. Selected Vehicles for SOC and Early Deployment, which is part of Capability Package (CP) 5A0156 NATO Deployable Headquarters Assets for Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) 

Both Capability Packages are directly related, and in order to reduce the overall system cost, the projects related to the provision of vehicles and trailers have been defined with similar technical characteristics. The procurement of the vehicles for these two projects, therefore, will be consolidated in the same ICB procedure.

NAMSA is acting as the Host Nation for this contract. The estimated total value is 30 million Euro ($38 million USD). The NAMSA references for this contract are CP 0A0149 and CP 5A0156. The Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFIB-NAMSA-CP-149-156.

The envisaged bidding method is the One Step International Competitive Bidding (ICB) Procedure. The bidders list for this ICB will include a list of registered firms identified from the NAMSA Source File as well as bidders nominated to the bidders list by their governments. 

OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The equipment within the scope of this contract will be delivered in two major phases. The first delivery will satisfy the assets required for the NATO Deployable CIS organizations to allow for technical integration with communication equipment. The list of equipment to be procured in the first phase has the reference CP 149. The second delivery will cover the remaining non-CIS assets necessary for CJTF and is included under the reference CP 156.

BIDDING PROCEDURE

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

With the exception of those firms already nominated as identified as potential sources from the NAMSA Source File, firms must be nominated by the US Government with the required Declaration of Eligibility (DOE). A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue the required DOE for a particular project. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bids (IFIB) has been issued. 
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 17 July 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Invitation for International Bids (IFIB) to those on the Bidders List: not before 1 August 2006 (The bidders will be allowed not fewer than 84 days to reply to the relevant ICB.)

The bids to be received in response to this IFIB will be valid for a period of up to 180 days. Please note that actual quantities to be included in the IFIB may vary slightly from those specified in this NOI.

<DESC>CDC, NIOSH, National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory has a requirement for a scanning mobility particle sizer for the nanoparticle program in the Technology Research Branch/NPPTL for aerosol generation and measurement. We require a broad measurement for our new project to develop innovative methodologies for evaluating particle penetration through protective clothing and ensembles.  The broader measurement capability will also be useful for other projects such as the study to investigate filtration efficiency of respiratory filters against very small nanoparticles.  
An instrument is required to measure particle concentrations up to 106 particles/cm3 and measure aerosol particles less than 1.0 um, i.e., nano- and submicron particles generated in an aerosol chamber.  The TSI model 3936-NL75 measures aerosol particles up to 1.0 um.  

Responsible sources that believe they can provide the required instrument are encouraged to submit  to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their written specifications and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.   Please submit capabilities and supporting information to:   Margaret L. Mooney at CDC/PGO/AAFB/Pittsburgh, (412)386-6431 or E-mail zia3@cdc.gov.   The Government will review any/all information submitted and determine if other qualified sources (technically compliant with the stated specification) do exist.   Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  

If not affirmative responses are received within 15 days, negotiations will be conducted with TSI, Inc, Shoreview, MN, as the only source for a scanning mobility particle sizer (Model 3936-NL75 ) meeting our needs and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to procure twelve (12) MK V PB aluminum Fast Interceptor Boats on a sole source basis from United States Marine Incorporated (USMI), 10011 Lorraine Road, Gulfport, MS 39503, along with spare parts and special tooling, training, and contractor in-country engineering technical services.   The Kuwait Ministry of Defence via Letter of Offer and Acceptance ((LOA) with the U. S. Government has specifically indicated the MK V PB as the requireded boat.  The MK V PB is a proprietary design owned by only two shipyards.  USMI is one of these owners.  The other shipyard, based on specific U. S. Navy inquiry, has indicated that they declined to participate in this program thus making USMI the sole source.  Neither the U. S. Government nor the Government of Kuwait has a technical data package that would allow for competition for the MK V PB.  As such, USMI is the only source with the requisite knowledge and experience required to complete const!  ruction of these MK V PBs.  See Numbered Note 22*****

Box 4840, Syracuse, NY 13221-4840, to procure engineering services for the AN/WLD-1(V)1 Remote Minehunting System (RMS) for the Mine Warfare and Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Mission Packages, which supports the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mission Module Program.  Efforts under this modification will include reconfiguring hardware and software components of the RMS to perform ASW operations.  Further efforts include fabricating two Remote Towed Active Source (RTAS) prototypes, Towed Array Power Conditioners (TAPCs) and tether cables.  Lockheed Martin owns the data rights to the RMS, was the original contractor to develop fabrication drawings for RTAS, and was the original designer of the TAPCs.  Therefore, Lockheed Martin is the only contractor who possesses the technical k!  nowledge, data, and necessary resources to perform the work in total described herein as well as adhere to the required timeframe to support the Navy’s needs.  All questions and comments shall be directed through electronic mail only to Ms. Kathleen Fenk at Kathleen.fenk@navy.mil.  See Numbered Note(s): 22*****

<DESC>This is a notice of intent from the Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division to issue a Firm Fixed Price Simplified Acquisition Purchase (SAP) Order, on an other than full and open competition basis, to Raytheon Company. This task is to reduce the risks associated with the project, including providing NAVAIR with optical and scanner design information to support test modeling, exploring alternatives and purchasing components to inject the signal from an alternative laser source into Raytheon's LS-4096 scanner, assessment of an alternative LS-4-96 resource for use in the ONR Demo and other preparations as necessary to ready an LS-4096 sensor for use in the demonstration. Raytheon Company is the developer and owner of the LS-4096 laser line scan system that will be used in joint tests in FY2007.  While there are other underwater imaging systems that can perform this same function, they are not compatiable with the technology that is planned to be utilized.  For information or questions regarding this notice, please contact Robert Myers at (301) 995-2055, E-mail:  rob.myers@navy.mil.  See Numbered Note:22

<CONTACT>Stacy Figlinski 850-235-5842 , or Contracting Officer Tammy Bair at 850-636-6115.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) is requesting proposals for full and open competition for the production of the Target Detecting Device (TDD) MK 71 Mod 1 on a firm fixed price basis.  This effort will provide for design, first article and production hardware, data, and engineering support services with a base year and four option years. The TDD MK 71 Mod 1 is a component of an air delivered, underwater mine assembly.  The TDD is a multiple influence sensor that uses a Navy-supplied target detection algorithm to determine the presence of a valid target and to generate a firing signal response.  It is powered by a battery and contains target sensors and the electronics that determine when the mine detonates.  The algorithm determines whether or not a valid target is present by processing sensor input data based upon timing, period, and amplitude.  When a valid target is detected, the algorithm issues a command to detonate the mine.  The TDD is highly sweep-resistant and is sized to fit all three QUICKSTRIKE warheads (MK 82/83 general purpose bombs and the Mk 65 Mine case).  The QUICKSTRIKE Mod 3, with the TDD MK 71 Mod 1, will provide the Fleet with a programmable target detection device that will help ensure optimized mine performance against changing target threats or changing countermeasures tactics.   The Government anticipates releasing the formal Request for Proposals (RFP) on or about June 22, 2006.  If you wish to receive an RFP package send your request to the Contract Specialist by email at Stacy.Figlinski@navy.mil by June 20, 2006.  Provide the following information:  company name, address, CAGE code, status as U.S. based company, name and phone number for a point of contact at your company.  NAICS code is 334511, FSC code is 5999, SBA size standard is 750 employees.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate a follow-on contract with KAI Research, Inc. (PI: Dr. Selma Kunitz), contract # N01-NS-2-2343, awarded 04/01/02) in order to continue to provide support for management with monitoring clinical trials, tracking Institute-supported clinical projects, developing a classification system for research projects and providing methodological support.
Background: NINDS ranks as fourth among the NIH Institutes and Centers in the number of ongoing recruiting clinical trials.  The NINDS spent in FY 2004 $1.19 billion dollars on 3,423 research projects; of this amount over $372 million dollars (31%) was spent on 769 (22%) projects that required human subjects approvals from an IRG.  Of these grants, 47 were designated as phase III clinical trials, and 138 phase I and or II clinical trials, or planning grants for phase III clinical trials.  There are currently over 60 DSMB’s that are managed by NINDS program staff, as well as dozens of safety monitoring boards and independent safety monitors that are tracked by staff.  In addition to the clinical trials, NINDS also funds 1282 other clinical studies.  
The Clinical Trial Cluster at NINDS is charged with ensuring the highest quality of each NINDS-funded clinical research project and compliance with DHHS/NIH/NINDS regulations regarding human subject protections and safety monitoring.  To accomplish our mission, the NINDS plans to continue work that began several years ago under this contract to provide the Institute and its funded investigators support, oversight, collaboration, and guidance in the conduct of clinical studies.  In the past 5 years the activities and responsibilities for this contract have increased substantially.  These include the support of new projects, such as SPOTRIAS; the addition of NIH gender and minority data collection for human subject research projects for all NINDS DER; the data tracking system (with the addition of over 300 projects in the past year as well as a substantially increased demand on reporting), and performance of a growing number of site visits to clinical research projects (currently more than double the number initially proposed).  The contract renewal will build upon existing activities and architecture and provide support and guidance as future clinical study issues arise.

The current Center for Clinical Trial management Resources contract expires at the end of March 2007, and the NINDS intends to negotiate a follow-on contract with KAI Research, Inc. for an additional five years of funding.  Based on the experience of this contractor, we expect that the contract will continue to yield outstanding work for the Institute.  For the next 5-year contract period, the NINDS plans to continue to implement performance in the following task areas:

TASK #1:  MONITOR QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL IN CLINICAL TRIALS

Quality assurance in NINDS-funded clinical trials is the responsibility of the principal investigator and his/her staff.  However, the extent of investigators' experience and skill in developing and applying effective quality assurance procedures varies, and some investigators stand to benefit from assistance and guidance received from experts in quality assurance in clinical trials.  The overall objective of the quality assurance/quality control performance area is to ensure that the data resulting from a trial are of highest quality and are considered valid and credible within the scientific and clinical community. 

To assist the investigators in meeting this objective, the contractor shall use its scientific resources to review, monitor, and correct (if needed) quality assurance procedures in NINDS-funded clinical trials.  Specifically, the contractor shall:

1.	Develop guidelines for investigators and NINDS, specifying the procedures that the investigator should develop and implement to assure data quality and integrity;

2.	Provide technical assistance to investigators and NINDS to facilitate the interpretation and implementation of the data quality assurance guidelines;

3.	Develop in cooperation with NINDS program staff written procedures for use by the contractor for conducting site visits to review, assess, and correct (if needed) data quality assurance procedures (the initial site visit) and to monitor, assess, and correct (if needed) the implementation and effectiveness of data quality assurance procedures throughout the trial (periodic site visits and the final site visit);

4.	Conduct site visits according to the specifications of the procedures document developed in number 3 above.

TASK #2:  CLINICAL PROJECT TRACKING and MAINTENANCE AND UPDATE OF THE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

In order to ensure the highest quality clinical research studies and compliance with DHHS/NIH/NINDS regulations regarding human subject’s protections and safety monitoring, accurate and up-to-date information on the status of all clinical research projects supported by NINDS is needed.  To facilitate the oversight process, the contractor shall be responsible for the ongoing development and maintenance of a tracking system for all NINDS clinical research projects.  The purpose of this function is to identify and track clinical research projects through their various stages, from initial concept development through application, evaluation and award phases.  This readily accessible tracking system will provide rapid reporting of all clinical research projects supported by NINDS.  In accordance with NINDS scientific, programmatic and regulatory requirements, the contractor shall develop and continuously update a classification system for categorizing ongoing funded research projects in clinical and basic science related to the development of neurological therapies.  The Contractor has access to the NIH IMPACII (Information for Management Planning Analysis, and Coordination) Database, more specifically, the following modules: QVR (Query View Report) System to download grant applications; Population Tracking System to track gender and minority information; and the NINDS Scientific Research Project Database (SRPD) which connects to several National Institutes of Health enterprise-wide databases including IMPACII On-line Transaction Processing Database (OLTP) and the IMPACII Report Database (IRDB).  Through having access to the databases described above, the contractor shall be responsible for:

1.	Maintaining and updating the existing CLIPS database and the generation of reports.  This includes reviewing all new grants for inclusion into the database.

2.	Conducting a risk assessment of clinical research projects.

3.	Collecting and reporting to the NIH the gender and minority data for all identified projects; the NINDS collects supplemental information that is added to the CLIPS to get a more accurate account.

4.	Upon request, provide the customized NINDS CLIPS database that encodes NINDS clinical research project descriptors, the customized data dictionary with both administrative and scientific modules and all data that is used to generate NINDS periodic and ad hoc reports.  

TASK #3:  STATISTICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL SUPPORT 

The contractor shall provide support and consultation to the NINDS in the area of statistics and clinical research methodology.  Specifically, assistance shall be required in the development of statistical and methodological guidelines for prospective applicants and for reviewers; statistical consultation will be needed in evaluating requests to submit applications for large clinical projects; expert advice will be needed to help solve methodological problems in ongoing clinical projects; and occasionally, statistical services will be required to conduct statistical analyses.  Additional activities may be needed for the support of special short-term projects to evaluate clinical research design, oversight, and conduct of clinical research.

TASK #4:  CLINICAL DATA ACQUISITION AND ARCHIVING  

The contractor shall provide consultation and services in the area of data acquisition and archiving.  After the termination of clinical research projects, investigators must decide which study materials will be retained or discarded.  For stored study materials, storage site, maintenance of confidentiality, and length of storage must be determined.  The contractor shall aid NINDS staff in developing information for investigators about archiving data after closure of a clinical trial. 

For some past contracts, data currently owned by NINDS requires archiving and analysis.  The contractor shall provide services necessary to acquire the data and to store them in an electronic form.  

TASK #5:  SPECIALIZED PROGRAM OF TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH IN ACUTE STROKE (SPOTRIAS)  

The contractor shall provide support of the SPOTRIAS data and the quality assurance/quality control of the SPOTRIAS sites.  Activities include the review of project and study descriptions, assist in data management and data management systems, data format, and quality control procedures; performance of site visits, assist in the development of common data elements, and provision of ongoing support and review.

TASK #6:  COMMON DATA ELEMENTS

The contractor shall provide support for the development of a core set of common data elements and forms supported by a data dictionary and data elements.  Literature searches will be conducted and reviewed, forms developed, consensus of key stakeholders sought, and once consensus is obtain these will be published and updated on the NINDS website.  Collaboration with other contractors, grantees or others within and outside the NINDS will be necessary.

The NINDS believes that KAI Research, Inc. is the only source that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise to continue the contract work based on their current experience and work under the contract to date.  NINDS requires immediate access to a contractor located close in proximity to be available to all NINDS Program Directors for conference calls, face-to-face meetings, etc. at a moments notice.  KAI has consistently demonstrated this ability and it’s in very close proximity to the NINDS locale.  KAI Research, Inc.’s familiarity with all ongoing NINDS clinical research portfolios and our infrastructure (specific NINDS/NIH databases) puts KAI, Research, Inc. in the most optimal position to continue to provide the Institute this work in a timely and cost-effective manner without causing substantial time delays or additional cost that would possibly be associated with an open competition to the government.  In order for another contractor to proceed at this point, it would cost the government significant additional dollars and major time delays during any sort of transition period.  A determination for the use of other than full and open competition has been made in accordance with 41 U.S.C. (c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302.  KAI Research, Inc. is considered the only source capable of performing the above services for the Government in order to maintain a constant level of consistency, uniformity and continuity of services provided.  Inherent duplication of the cost to the Government and unacceptable performance delays make competition for this requirement unfeasible.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 562211   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Stericycle, Inc. for the removal of Biological/Infectious waste from two (2) US EPA facilities in Cincinnati, OH.  The US EPA intends to issue a three (3) year Blanket Purchase Agreement for this service..  The anticipated number of pick-ups is approximately 26 to 30 per year.    The contractor shall provide approximately 16 standard size (approximately 5 or 6 cubic feet) boxes  with the liners to be used to package biological/infectious waste.  The boxes shall be marked in accordance with applicable Federal, State, and local regulations.  The contractor shall be properly permitted and authorized by the appropriate regulatory agency (i.e., EPA, DOT) to transport, handle,  and destroy infectious waste and must transport, handle, and destroy infectious waste in accordance with all Federal, State, and local regulations and shall return to the EPA Project Officer a completed manifest for each shipment within four weeks of the shipment date. US EPA requires a contractor  that possesses the unique capabilities of being specifically licensed and/or permitted by EPA and all other applicable regulatory agencies (i.e. Department of Transportation, etc.) for removal transport and destruction/treatment (incineration) of infectious waste.   Furthermore, a local company is  required because of the nature of the waste (biological in nature) and the frequency of pick-ups required.  This unique capability is essential for contract performance because it is a legal requirement based on regulation of these services.  Based on EPA's knowledge of the industry only  Stericycle, Inc., has been identified with these capabilities and licensing within the Cincinnati area. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation  must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the  purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 562211.  Please submit your request in writing to Courtney Whiting by e-mail to whiting.courtney@epa.gov.  No telephone requests or request by fax will be  honored.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study for the State Securities Commission (SSC) for the expansion of the Hanoi Securities Trading Center’s (HASTC) software and general infrastructure.

Vietnam is pursuing a strategy to develop the securities market by developing two trading centers (exchanges), one in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and one in Hanoi.  The HCMC Exchange became operational in 2000.  HASTC was established in 1998 and officially opened for operation in March 2005.  As of March 2006, ten companies were listed at the HASTC.

Both exchanges are governed by the SSC, which is an agency of the Ministry of Finance.  The Grantee, the SSC, has received U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) grant funding which will provide expert services to build a roadmap for the expansion of the HASTC from its current size of six (6) registered companies, to the target 200 companies registered by 2007.  It will also fund a technical visit for members of the HASTC and SSC to travel to New York to visit with NASDAQ and other pertinent entities that will help them better understand the trading environment and what will be required for the HASTC expansion.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $422,000 grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

In that event, the contracting officer shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.  (f) The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors.

Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this edit to FAA ADS-B announcement of June 7, 2006 is to correct the E-mail address shown for Ms. Amy Durik. The E-mail address is changed  from: Amy CTR Durik/AWA/CNTR/FAA to:  Amy.CTR.Durik@faa.gov  ____________________________________________________________________________ On April 6, 2006, the FAA posted a public announcement advising industry that the FAA intends to develop a NAS wide acquisition program for Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B), Traffic Information Service - Broadcast (TIS-B), and Flight Information Service - Broadcast (FIS-B) services with a goal of an "in-service" decision by 2010.   A second announcement was posted on May 16, 2006.  This announcement requested Patent information and stated that an industry day was planned after approval of the program by the FAA Joint Resources Council.  The FAA JRC approved the NAS wide program today, June 7, 2006.   Accordingly, an Industry Day is planned for June 19, 2006 where the overall program will be discussed.  In addition, it is planned to conduct individualized discussions with vendors starting June 20, 2006.  All interested vendors are invited to participate irrespective of prior responses to FAA ADS-B announcements.       The event will be held at FAA Headquarters in the Bessie Coleman Conference Room located on the second floor.  The planned starting time is 8:30 A.M.   The address is: 800 Independence Avenue S.W.  Washington, D.C. 20591 Vendors planning to participate in Industry Day activities should make reservations with:   Ms Amy Durik  Communications Lead  202-385-8394 Desk   E-Mail:  Amy.CTR.Durik@faa.gov Individual vendor discussions may be scheduled with Ms. Durik on a 1 Â½ hour basis starting at 8:30 A.M June 20th.   FAA is considering allowing vendors to speak on June 19 with the understanding that FAA is not endorsing or sponsoring any vendor.  Since this stage of the acquisition represents an exchange of information and not a down-select process, a vendor's choice whether to request a presentation and/or to hold an individual discussion will have no bearing on eligibility to submit a proposal and will have no impact on future evaluation determinations.     Vendors interested in providing not to exceed 20 minute presentations should contact Ms. Durik.  Depending on the number of responses, the FAA retains the option to select a subset of vendors for presentations, to limit presentation times, or chose to have no vendor presentations.   Vendors should indicate to Ms. Durik any equipment needs to support presentations.   The FAA has received significant vendor input regarding the structure of the program.  FAA will continue to encourage the maximum exchange of information.   The May 16, 2006 public announcement also requested patent information which would be published to foster industry communications and potential teaming arrangements.    The FAA has not researched the information received and does not substantiate that the information provided is accurate or complete.   The following patent responses were received: ADSI, Inc.  1.  U.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NUMBER IS CHANGED FROM FA4819-06-T-0033 TO FA4819-06-R-0008.  The procurement contemplated is for a Radar Target Generators (RTG) for the APG-63 (V)1 and APG-70 radar test benches at the Integrated Avionics Test Facility (IATF) IAW specifications and attachments identified in the solicitation.  This RTS shall include hardware and software to realisitically generate precise, user-defined target returns for the APG-63(V)1 and APG-70 radar systems.  The completed effort will provide a fully-integrated RTS with multiple target channels capable of accurately producing synthetic radar targets.The IATF uses RTGs to conduct radar operational flight program (OFP) testing for F-15 aircraft.  Det 2, 28 TS currently has no target generation capability for the APG-63(V)1 radar, which is installed in the majority of the F-15C aircraft fleet.  The absence of aan APG-63(V)1 RTS prevents the IATF from fully evaluating the APG-63(V)1.  Additionally, the existing IATF APG-70 RTS is based on obsolete technology and is over 10 years old.  The age of the existing APG-70 RTS is becoming a limiting factor as the parts continue to age and fail.  These deficiencies severely limit the Air Force’s ability to fully test F-15 OFPs as they are released to the community.  The IATF’s focus on integrated avionics testing hinges on the ability to generate realistic radar targets with overlaid jamming to evaluate the radar’s performance in an electronic attack environment.  Completion of the RTS integration will permit successful F-15 radar testing and allow versatility and increased cost savings not possible through conventional flight testingflight-testing. A firm-fixed price contract award is contemplated. This action will be unrestricted and open to all parties interested. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334511 with a small business employee size standard of 750. It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued electronically on or about 16 June 2006 on the Federal Business Opportunities web page at http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Paper copies will not be available. Once the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/ amendments to any and all documents.  The site visit is scheduled for Wednesday 21 June 2006 at 8:30 A.M. CST.  In order to participate in the site visit, contractors must contact the individuals listed at the end of this synopsis description for further instruction.  All specific information about the site visit will be given at that time.  Contractors must be prepared to provide the government with specific information for clearance into the IATF such as Name, SSAN, Clearance Level, Citizenship, DOB, POB, and Unit/Company Assigned.  Any prospective contractor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award. Information concerning CCR registered requirements may be viewed via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling the CCR Registration Center at 1-888-227-2423. The government contemplates using the Price-Performance Tradeoff (PPT) method for the evaluation process.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   THE SYNOPSIS ISSUED ON 5/31/06 IS HEREBY CHANGED TO A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION.  THIS COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES  IS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The solicitation number is RFQ-RT-06-00156.  This procurement, which is 100% set aside for small business, has an associated North American Industry  Classification System (NAICS) Code of  541990, with a small business size standard of $6 million.  A. TITLE - "South Wind: Thermal imaging for detecting of industrial gas emissions in Crittenden County, Arkansas and Memphis, Tennessee" B. INTRODUCTION - The region adjacent to Crittenden county is  home to numerous petrochemical and refinery operations, which contributes in part to the region's poor air quality. EPA Region 6, in cooperation with the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) and EPA Region 4, is investigating the utility of using remote sensing technologies to detect  fugitive gas emissions from industrial facilities and pipeline corridors. The use of remote sensing will enable facility owner/operators, environmental agencies and local government officials to identify likely sources of emissions that may not be included in traditional emission inventories.  Recent advances in thermal imagery data collection yield more detailed information at higher resolutions, offering the capability to detect unknown or unauthorized chemical releases or disposal on land, air, and water.  Thermal remote imaging provides an opportunity to survey a wide area of  potential fugitive emissions sources with a high degree of accuracy and certainty. This technology can also identifies the likely sources in areas that are difficult and hazardous to access with traditional sampling techniques.  The requirements for this project dictate the use of advanced remote  imaging technologies. Atmospheric releases (or emissions) of gas compounds can be detected only by using imaging systems that can collect data in the thermal or mid to longwave infrared (MWIR to LWIR)  region of the electromagnetic spectrum (defined from 3-14 micrometers). It is in this region most  gaseous chemical compounds have spectral features that are used for identification purposes.  The instrument must meet the following performance requirements (see technical criteria document for more details): (1) spectral range: within the window of 3 - 14 micrometers  (2) image locating ability:  GPS unit required.  Results from this project will support priority research in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), specifically for the Clean Air Act (as amended). C.  OBJECTIVES -  The objective of this acquisition is to acquire thermal imagery at high spatial resolution in order to  identify fugitive gaseous chemical compounds and locate them at an acceptable level of accuracy. This procurement of services is part of an ongoing  "proof-of-concept" project to determine if thermal imaging systems can detect fugitive gas discharges and emissions to direct  further sampling using  standard analytical chemistry methods.  D.  SCOPE OF WORK - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requires the contractor to perform the following tasks:  TASK 1. PREPARATION OF WORKPLAN - Contractor shall prepare a detailed workplan for the project. The workplan shall detail:  (1) an  understanding of the project goals and objectives; (2) the technical specifics and performance details of the thermal sensor to be used in the project; (3) assurances that the sensor package can be integrated into an aircraft platform without significant engineering modifications; (4) details of  the analytical process used to identify gas phase compound releases; (5) method used to geo-locate identified releases using GPS technology.  TASK 2.  FUGITIVE EMISSION SURVEY -  SUBTASK 2.1.  THERMAL IMAGERY ACQUISITION.  - 1.  The contractor shall acquire thermal imagery data in the vicinity of   Crittenden County, Arkansas and Memphis, Tennessee.  Data will be collected along the Mississippi River and in urban areas in Memphis and West Memphis.  Accurate maps and supporting documentation will be provided.  The Contractor will utilize an imaging or scanning instrument that is able to  collect single (panchromatic), multispectral (defined as 2-50 individual bands), or hyperspectral (defined as more than 100 separate but continuous bands) over the MWIR - LWIR portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (3 - 13 micrometers).  The sensor shall be able to detect (defined as being able to  determine/isolate an object from the background) gas phase hydrocarbon compounds, including single and double bond species such as methane, butane, ethane, propene (propylene), and ethene (ethylene). The output of the sensor system shall allow visualization of the gas leak plume in real-time.  The  contractor shall provide personnel and equipment to support one (1) field team and one (1) airborne team (see subtask 2.2). The field team shall have the necessary equipment to document all activities and have personal protective equipment (hardhat, flame retardant coveralls, safety glasses,  hearing protection) to enter chemical plant and refineries. There will be no confined space work.  These are the specific qualifications for task 2:  (1) knowledge in the operation of thermal cameras, particularly the FLIR GasfindIR; and, (2)  the offeror shall have knowledge and experience in  using these devices for Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) applications, that is monitoring industrial facilities for fugitive gas or vapor phase compound leaks and documenting discovered leaks including GPS position.  The contractor is expected to be able to deploy and operate the instrumentation  independently and without direct supervision by the project principle investigator. The contractor is expected to understand how to operate the instrumentation in order to acquire the best possible data under a variety of environmental conditions. Due to the research nature of this project, no  formal standard operation procedure (SOP) has been developed, although a SOP for this type of work will be drafted as a result of this activity.  No training on the use of the instrumentation will be provided by EPA. Potential contractors requiring training may wish to contact the ITC below.

SCOPE

This effort provides the 412 Test Wing (TW) access to Boeing Aircraft Hardware in the Loop (HITL) Labs and High Fidelity Aircraft Simulators, for platforms such as AWACS Block 30/35 and 40/45, F-15, and F-18, integrated into a distributed test environment.  412TW Live, Virtual, and Constructive (LVC) assets will participate in a distributed test event in August 2006 for the Joint Mission Environment Test Capability (JMETC) program.  The 412TW engineers would like to check out the mission flow, network data load, and link communication with command/control aircraft.  The contractor shall provide various mission-based Link 16 data and “ownship” data real-time to 412TW assets to help with this check out.  “Ownship” data is position and weapon system status data that is generated by the aircraft HITL Lab or simulator before it is packaged for transmission on Link-16. These HITL Labs and/or Simulators will be tasked to participate in defined test scenarios to support testing.  In these test scenarios these HITL Labs and/or simulators will be asked to send and receive link 16 data link messages per the scenario.  Message data will be compared with recorded HITL Lab and/or simulator transmitted and received data to verify message traffic between all systems within the network of LVC systems participating in the test.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT:  SUBSCRIPTION TO A SCANNER DATA BASE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM.  This announcement is a sources sought only.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement or to otherwise pay for the information received.  The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) is a Department of Defense (DoD) Agency that is responsible for the operation of approximately 269 military commissaries throughout the world.  A commissary is the equivalent of a commercial grocery store.  DeCA is seeking sources that can provide a subscription to an Information Retrieval System containing Sales/Movement Data for scanned products sold by DeCA Commissaries and commercial supermarkets.  The database must include sales/movement data for all scanned products sold by DeCA commissaries both within and outside the Continental United States (CONUS - defined as the 48 contiguous States); comparable, statistically significant sales data from a majority of supermarket chains throughout the United States; and sales movement data from supermarkets within the same geographical (metro) areas as commissaries.  In this context, supermarkets are defined as traditional grocery stores with annual volume over $2 million and Supercenter/mass merchant formats operated by Mass Merchandisers.  Access to any available causal data and data the contractor provides to other retailers is also required.  Available data should include the current month and the previous 24 months.  IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE that DeCA front-end scanner data is not readily available to the general public.  As mandated by statue (10 U.S.C. 2487b), DeCA makes this data available to interested firms for an annual subscription fee (currently $821,281 per year).  Execution of the requisite subscription agreement application and advance payment of $821,281 per year of data requested will entitle the subscriber to all available DeCA front-end scanner data for the years purchased.  The purchase of DeCA front-end scanner data IS NOT A GUARANTEE OF AN AWARD.  Respondents to this notice MUST be able to purchase not only DeCA front-end data but also the comparable commercial grocery store data for the same 24-month period.  Commercial grocery store chains offer their front-end data to interested firms on a fee basis.  DeCA is not interested in a contractor database that does not include front-end scanner data from both DeCA and comparable commercial sources, to include historical data.  Prior to DeCA awarding a contract for an Information Retrieval System, the successful offeror must execute an annual subscription agreement with DeCA.  The Preferred Data retrieval method will be accomplished by access to the contractor's database system through the World Wide Web.  The proposed hardware/software solution must include a user-friendly, menu-based drag and click type application that will allow for significant data manipulation and report building capabilities, to include ad-hoc reporting, by DeCA personnel.  Access to the web-based application must be compatible with the current DeCA network, shall not conflict with existing programs or capabilities, and shall not impede current operations.  If web-based application does not allow for the ability to produce ad-hoc reports, contractor shall submit alternative method for access to database that includes the same characteristics as outlined above.  As a minimum, either method of access must enable the operator to generate reports, to include ad-hoc reports, based on any number of parameters, to include, but not limited to: (1) Geographic Areas (DeCA regions, areas within regions, stores, and commercially defined markets); (2) Products (departments, categories, sub-categories and/or segments, brands, manufacturers, and a full range of product attributes such as UPC, selling unit size, selling unit type (can, bottle, etc.), selling unit flavor, and other well-defined product characteristics; (3) Measures and Derivative Calculations (dollar sales, unit sales, volume sales, Average Cumulative Volume (ACV) percent, average pricing (promotional, non-promotional), lift percentages, sales per point of distribution, etc); and (4) Time Periods (weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541910 and the Business Size Standard is $6.5 Million.  A solicitation will be issued for this requirement at a later date.  Organizations who believe they meet the requirements as identified above may submit their company information, no later than June 26, 2006, to:  Defense Commissary Agency, AMDR (Will Madera), 1300 E Avenues, Fort Lee, VA 23801-1800.

<DESC>NASA/GRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for design, development, test, and evaluation (DDT&E) of an actuation system for a flight-qualified actuator the Upper Stage (US) Thrust Vector Control (TVC) System of NASA’s Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV). Currently the first CLV orbital flight is scheduled for January 2012.  Further CLV US planning information is available at    http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/eps/eps_data/119491-OTHER-001-001.pdf    .  This effort is intended to reduce the technical and schedule risk for the TVC by completing actuation system development and design through Critical Design Review, allowing for easy transition to a production phase.  For the purposes of this synopsis, the actuation system is defined as actuator, controller, and all associated connections/cabling.  The TVC actuators shall meet the following performance requirements: Rated Load: 20,000 lbs; Rated velocity: 1.7 in/s; Total Stroke: 2 in.  At this time these actuator performance requirements are preliminary.  For CLV US application, they will be used to position a gimbaled J-2 rocket engine in two directions during the ascend phase of the CLV mission.  Consequently, the actuator weight, size, & reliability are major considerations in the design and development effort.	The development effort will include bench tests, breadboards and/or prototype units as necessary to mature the actuation system design.  More details on the performance specifications will be included in any resultant Request for Proposal (RFP) which is planned for release in the summer of 2006.	The intent of this Sources Sought is to identify interested participants and their capabilities for providing human-rated flight hardware.	 Vendors having the capabilities necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references highlighting these capabilities.  Please limit responses to 4 pages/slides or less.  All responses should be provided in MS Word document or Adobe PDF format via electronic media. Technical questions should be directed to: Mr. Cameron Cunningham (216) 433-5516.  Procurement related questions should be directed to: Ms. Jane Cochran (216) 433-2739. Please advise if your proposed solutions will be a commercial or commercial-type product.  A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101.  In addition, provide information on the nature and amount of proprietary information in the proposed solution as it applies to design, fabrication, drawings, software, etc.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Providing data/information that is limited or restricted for use by NASA for that purpose would be of very little value and such restricted/limited data/information is not solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for the requirement. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto.  All responses shall be submitted no later than June 23 to NASA/GRC Procurement Office, Attn: CHB/Jane Cochran, Contracting Officer, Glenn Research Center, 21000 Brookpark Road, Cleveland, OH 44135 or via e-mail at Jane.M.Cochran@nasa.gov.

<DESC>The Administration for Children and Families, Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) through the Program Support Center, Strategic Acquisition Service, Division of Acquisition Management is providing the following source sought notice to determine the availability of businesses to serve as Intermediaries to conduct activities necessary for the project entitled, “Trafficking Outreach and Victim Identification.”

In October 2000, Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA), Public Law 106-386, and was reauthorized in December 2003 by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003, P.L. 108-193.  This legislation emphasizes prosecution of traffickers, protection and assistance to victims of trafficking, and an expansion of U.S. activities internationally to prevent trafficking altogether.  Each year as many as 700,000 people around the world, primarily women and children, are bought, sold, transported and held for the purpose of forced commercial sex or labor.   As a result of the trafficking reauthorization of 2003, benefits and services are provided to certain family members of trafficking victims who have received T visas and may also include services to assist potential victims of trafficking in achieving certification and to assist minor dependent children of victims of severe forms of trafficking.  On September 30, 2003, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Program Support Center (PSC) awarded a 3 year contract entitled, “Rescue and Restore Victims of Human Trafficking,” for the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to Ketchum, Inc.  The contract was for the creation, publication and dissemination of materials and products necessary to conduct a national Human Trafficking Public Awareness campaign.  The Campaign established local anti-trafficking coalitions in 17 cities/states.  In each city, networks or “coalitions” of non-profit and government agencies were formed to help identify and assist trafficking victims, as well as disseminate campaign messages and materials and publicize the issue through their communications network.  Coalition partners may consist of local government personnel, law enforcement, family court and juvenile justice officials, public defenders, community health officials, and local service providers.  The coalitions have been built in the following 17 geographic areas:  Phoenix, Arizona; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Las Vegas, Nevada; Newark, New Jersey; Long Island, New York; Los Angeles and San Francisco, California; Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota; St. Louis, Missouri; Portland, Oregon, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Houston, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Miami and Tampa, Florida.  

The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), ACF is seeking to continue and expand its efforts in 10-15 of those communities through intermediary entitles who will serve as the focal point for an intensification of local outreach and identification of victims of human trafficking.  Each intermediary will subcontract with local anti-trafficking grassroots organizations that identify and work with victims of human trafficking.  In its role as planner, fiscal agent, monitor, and technical assistance provider, the intermediary contractor shall establish and manage the local network of subcontractors.   This project has the following objectives:  1) To increase the number of victims of trafficking who are identified, assisted in leaving the circumstances of their servitude, and connected to qualified service agencies and to the HHS certification process so they may receive the benefits and services to the same extent as refugees; 2) To build on the work accomplished to date within the cities/states establishing a dedicated coalition of key law enforcement personnel, social service providers, local government, and health care, and working collaboratively to end trafficking in their community and to educate the general public through campaign messages and materials; 3) To leverage the strengths of both grassroots groups that are trusted institutions within neighborhoods working with trafficked persons and local intermediaries with the organizational capacity to serve as program managers, fiscal agents, and technical assistance providers to local non-profit and government agencies; 4) To provide financial assistance to existing programs of outreach to populations among which victims of human trafficking may be found to support and expand their success rate in identifying trafficking victims; 5) To connect trafficking victims with local qualified service agencies prepared to assist them, through the “Per Capita Victim Service Benefit” contract; 6) To connect local anti-trafficking efforts with the activities, materials, and assistance of the national “Trafficking Public Awareness Campaign”; and 7) To develop a link between the Intermediary Contractor and the HHS Trafficking Information and Referral Hotline so that information received by the Hotline regarding potential local victims can be relayed in a timely manner to local law enforcement authorities, service providers, and outreach agencies.  Tasks include:  1) As a planner, the offeror would have the responsibility to develop a management plan identifying in detail both the overall context of the human trafficking problem in the local jurisdiction and the local target population the Contractor will focus on and establishing goals and benchmarks for identifying and bring forward trafficking victims; 2)  meetings with the ORR program office to submit a draft management plan, review target population data, performance goals, specifics for sub awards, and performance schedules and timeframes; 3) subcontract with local anti-trafficking grassroots organizations that identify and work with victims of trafficking; 4) providing monthly reports to ORR; 5) provide mentoring and technical assistance to subcontractors and to the local coalition of non-profit and government agencies, to support and improve the quality of identification activities and to build the capacity of the grassroots contractors; 6) serve as the focal point for contact and coordination among HHS-funded Anti-Trafficking Activities, Public Agencies, including law enforcement, legal services, health and social services, and the Grassroots Network; 7) establish and jointly maintain lines of communication among the grassroots network of subcontractors and the Trafficking and Public Awareness Campaign, the Per Capita Benefit Contractors and the Trafficking Information and Referral Hotline so that victims are referred to appropriate, local service providers, campaign strategy materials and media outreach are available locally, and so information from the Hotline is readily available for analysis, follow-up and referral; 8) serve as the focal point for information on trafficking for the local community and provide technical support to agencies that wish to support the broader anti-trafficking effort but which do not receive federal funds.

Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statements via e-mail by June 16, 2006, 2:00 p.m. local prevailing time, to the Contracting Officer at the following e-mail address:  anita.nearhoof@psc.hhs.gov or pscacquisitions@psc.hhs.gov, reference 06Y009349.

<DESC>The Technology Applications Program Office, Fort Eustis, VA,  is seeking small, lightweight batteries for an existing weapons system.  Offerors are invited to provide comments concerning the feasibility of the specifications listed below. The batteries must  fit in existing battery compartments currently holding heavier sealed lead acid batteries and supply power and discharge rates as identified below. It is anticipated these batteries will be a Lithium-Ion type in order to achieve the safety, weight, size, and power requirements.  However, other types may be considered if they can meet all specifications.  The batteries will undergo strict safety qualification in order to be approved for flight aboard military rotary-wing aircraft in the crew compartment. Batteries will be subjected to multiple penetrations by solid metal objects and gun-fire in all three axes as well as harsh environmental stresses. The ability of the batteries to resist explosions, fires, and thermal runaway while subjected to destructive tests is critical. The chemical composition of the batteries should be such that it resists these negative conditions upon penetration.  Size: The maximum battery dimensions desired are: Length: 9.8” (NATO standard aircraft battery connector on long axis on the side)  Width 8.3” Height: 7.60”.  Voltage: The aircraft is a 24VDC system. Nominal voltage required is 24-28VDC and may not exceed 32VDC. The battery management unit must regulate voltages within these parameters while protecting against both high and low voltage hazards associated with extreme battery voltage states. Minimum Amp-Hour rating: 14AH. Desired Amp-Hour rating 40AH+ (based on a 2 year end of life rating).  Max discharge rate: The battery must support the “in-rush” current required by the weapon system. Minimum discharge rates must support: 500 amps for 5 milliseconds or more; 120 amps for 0.5 Seconds or more; continuous discharge must be 100 amps. Operating Temperatures: Operations are regularly encountered from -37 Celsius to +60 Celsius with extremes of -55 Celsius to +73 Celsius. Battery storage temperature range is  -55 Celsius to +85 Celsius. Weight: 35 lbs or less per battery is required. 20 lbs or less is desired (this includes battery cells and management unit).  It is anticipated that 1,800 batteries will be required over a five year period.  

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  All responses must be emailed to the contracting officer at manfred.bischoff@us.army.mil.  Interested companies must submit a Statement of Capabilities that addresses current and future products, technical expertise, production capability, research and development capability, and facilities.  Offerors are invited to provide comments concerning the feasibility of the specifications above.  Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size and should also indicate if the firm is foreign-owned.   Provide a listing of any previous government contracts.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code 335912 Primary Battery Manufacturing applies to this acquisition with a size standard of 1,000 employees.   All parties are asked to provide a telephone number, an e-mail address, and a facsimile number in their response.   Information marked proprietary will be protected and will not be divulged unless mandated by existing laws.

The Southern Region Contracting Center-East (SRCC-E), Ft McPherson,  Georgia is conducting market research to determine the availability and capability from sources that are available to support the ARCENT Force Protection Program by accomplishing required tasks and delivering professional products within CONUS and OCONUS. The ARCENT Force Protection Program focuses on the five components of force protection:  Physical Security; Anti-Terrorism; Law Enforcement  Operations; Operations Security; and Personal Protective Services.  The Program is designed to address a variety of threats that impact readiness, morale,  health, and welfare.  These threats include:  terrorism; criminal acts; foreign intelligence; paramilitary forces; saboteurs; protest groups; and disaffected  persons.  For the Force Protection Program to be effective, a centralized and tightly focused (holistic) management approach, at the installation, unit, and  ARCENT level, is required to identify, consolidate, and synchronize requirements; assess risk; and prioritize the distribution of resources.  The Force  Protection Program requires continuous assessment, validation, and update to stay viable and effective.  The Program must be fully integrated with all  available intelligence, counterintelligence, and other security programs.  The scope of the Force Protection Analysis Cell (FPAC) mission is to provide  professional assistance and staff support to the Provost Marshal and the forward deployed subordinate commands.

Require personnel security Force Protection Analysis Cell personnel will maintain a SECRET security clearance, except for the Project Manager who requires a TOP SECRET/SCI  security clearance.  The cell provides staff support in three major areas: operations, plans & policy, and exercises and assessments.  Major areas of  support include force protection and anti-terrorism policy, identification and resolution of vulnerabilities, exercises, assessments, technology, budget,  and requirement identification.  Each member of the cell must have sound understanding of security and antiterrorism policy and operations.  Each  member of the cell must have experience working at the senior staff level and be capable of quickly analyzing problems, developing potential courses of  action to resolve those problems, evaluating courses of action, and making a recommendation on the appropriate course of action.  Once a decision is  made, members of the FPAC must have the skills and knowledge to coordinate and execute the selected course of action.  The FPAC must accomplish  these functions within established timelines and in accordance with required procedural or policy documents.

<SUBJECT>A -- High Temperature Polymer Composite Components
<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), Edwards AFB intends to solicit and award a sole source, Firm-Fixed Price contract, under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to Advanced Ceramics, 3292 E Hemisphere Loop, Tucson, AZ, 85706.   AFFTC requires expertise in the following areas:  Patented process of Aquacore, an innovative high-temperature, water-soluble mandrel materials that can be used in fugitive, lost, cost, and trapped tooling procedures.  The NAICS code is 541710.

The following item will be procured:  Provide non-personal services for all labor, tools, materials, and facilities to fabricate and characterize poly vinyl pyrrolidone polymers with polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes to form thermoset materials using water soluble tooling.  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the contractor will work together to develop high temperature polymer composite components for use as propulsion structures.  AFRL and the contractor will hold regular teleconferences to track the progress of the program.  The contractor will consult with AFRL to identify two (2) different types of POSS materials that are compatible with poly vinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) to develop a film of PVP and the POSS material.  The contractor will also characterize the PVP-POSS films.  The contractor will fabricate tools using their proprietary water-soluble tooling materials. The PVP-POSS films will be applied to the tools prior to composite fabrication as a sealant to prevent the resin ingress into the tools. The contractor will fabricate polymer composite panels and cylinders using the sealed tools.  Composites will be fabricated using standard epoxy prepreg using standard autoclave cycle based on a composite system defined in consultation with AFRL. When heated to above 160°C, the PVP-POSS mixture is expected to react to form a very strong, thermoset surface layer acting as a fire-retardant, low-char yield layer for the composite material by increasing the glass transition temperature of the top layer of the composite structure. In the contract, the following work plan is desired:  CLIN 0001-Meet with AFRL to finalize experimental plan and raw material selection (2 weeks after contract award).   CLIN 0002-Submission of  interim report on research activities to date (6 weeks after contract award).

<SUBJECT>U -- Conduct Powered Flight Training
<DESC>Request for Information was posted on April 17, 2006.  RFI resulted in several questions submitted by potential offerors.  The following are responses to those questions.
QUESTION:  Is this in fact the flight screening syllabus or something else?  Why the four place aircraft? 
ANSWER:  This is the Flight Screening program.  The four-seat desirable is to give us the option of a third person riding in the back.  This additional person would usually be either a non-scheduled student gaining additional learning by observation, or a senior instructor evaluating or upgrading the instructor in the front seat.  However, the normal crew compliment will be two, therefore the aircraft should benefit from extra performance if only two of the four seats are occupied.

QUESTION:  How many (40 training day) classes in the academic year?  Per semester?
ANSWER:  During an academic semester, it is a single “class,” however the class will be divided into alternating days.  Therefore, when computing sortie requirements, there are actually 80 training days in a semester, with each group of cadets getting 40 days.  Therefore, each cadet only gets 40 days to get through the program, and will only have time to fly once per day. 

QUESTION:  How many (15 training day) classes in the summer?
ANSWER:  During the summer, there will actually be three different classes, 15 days each.  However, the students will be available all day, easily able to fly twice (weather providing).

QUESTION:  How many students per class?  
ANSWER:  The number will vary based upon several factors, not the least of which are the pilot needs of the Air Force that year, and the number of medically pilot-qualified cadets.  At present, the loads are approximately 200 students per academic semester and 130 over the entire summer.  However, those ratios will most likely change in the future to maximize training opportunities during the summer.  The total number of students per year will be approximately 500.

QUESTION:  Is there a minimum/maximum class size?  
ANSWER:  Not specifically.  Although ratios may change, the total for the year will be approximately 500.  However, from an infrastructure standpoint, the operations during the summer will most likely place the highest demand on resources and will therefore drive the requirements for numbers of aircraft and instructors.

QUESTION:  Does allowable class size varies re: academic year vs. summer?
ANSWER:  Yes, as described above.

QUESTION:  To what extent are the MFIs available to schedule?
ANSWER:  Each MFI should be able to fly twice per week, and may in reality fly much more often than that.  However, the contractor can not rely on MFI availability when building their schedule and determining required resources.

QUESTION:  Are there a minimum number of flight events the MFIs will accomplish per class or per student?
ANSWER:  No.

QUESTION:  On any given training day, what is the earliest time a student can report for training and the latest time a student can depart (i.e., what is the available scheduling range)?  
ANSWER:  There is a significant difference between the academic year (semesters) and the summer.  During the semesters, the earliest practical report time is 0600, and the last group of cadets must be out of the building by 1820.  Due to their academic schedule, cadets are available in three blocks within this timeframe, each block consisting of 4 hours and 15 minutes.  This block must include travel time between the Cadet Area and the airfield, which is planned at 30 minutes each way, leaving slightly over 3 hours total for training at the airfield.  This timeframe is completely governed by the cadets’ schedule on the academic campus and has no flexibility.  In contrast, there is significant flexibility in the summer, since AFS will be the cadets’ sole military duty.  The contractor may determine report and dismissal times, as long as Air Force crew rest restrictions are met.

QUESTION:  How/where are the cadets currently receiving this training?  What aircraft?
ANSWER:  Cadets are currently receiving training at the USAFA airfield, which is a requirement.  The current contractor utilizes DA-20 aircraft.  

QUESTION:  Who is the incumbent contractor?  Or is it performed in-house by the Government?
ANSWER:  Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, located in Dayton FL. currently holds the contract

QUESTION:  If there is a current contract, is it all-inclusive, i.e. does it include training and maintenance, or are they separate contracts?
ANSWER:  Yes, there is a current contract and it is all inclusive.  The future contractor will be responsible for maintenance on their proposed aircrafts.

QUESTION:  Is the 25 hour syllabus in the RFI new or is it the one currently being used?
ANSWER:  The 25-hour syllabus in the RFI is a draft that is about to go into effect.  However, the changes from the current syllabus are extremely minor.

QUESTION:  What are the number and clusters of blackout training dates?
ANSWER:  There are three semesters per calendar year – Spring, Summer, and Fall.

QUESTION:  What is the proposed contract type, i.e. CPFF, CPAF, FFP, (etc.)?
ANSWER:  Firm-fixed Priced. 

QUESTION:  The RFI indicates the Government will provide fuel service.  Does this mean all required fuel will be provided on-site by the Government?
ANSWER:  Yes.

QUESTION:  Will there be any connection between this program and the contract awarded to Doss Aviation to provide Introductory Flight Training to ROTC cadets?
ANSWER:  The connection will be a common syllabus, with a common goal of screening pilot candidates.  However, there will be vast differences between the operations of the two programs due to numerous known factors.

QUESTION:  Can the Government make available to prospective offerors the current contract(s) which supports this effort?
ANSWER:  Yes, written requests will be accepted only.


QUESTION:  Will selected contractor be allowed to train cadets at alternate locations/sites to avoid inclement weather season? 
ANSWER:  No.
QUESTION:  To allow us to plan for this solicitation can you provide more details on the anticipated dates for the  Industry Day, site visit, Draft RFP, Final RFP, Proposal Due Date, expected Award.
ANSWER:  The Milestones are tentative and will be updated and posted to FedBizOps at time of finalization.
QUESTION:    Can you provide an expected total value for the 10 year program? 
ANSWER:  Rough Order of Magnitude ranges between $25M - $35M
QUESTION:  Can you provide information on the insurance requirements anticipated in the contract? 
ANSWER:  Aircraft Public Liability Insurance requirements will be stated in the Performance Work Statement.  
QUESTION:  What requirements for SB and SDB are expected in this solicitation? 
ANSWER:  Final decision for Small Business and Small Disadvantage Business goals has not been coordinated with the Small Business Specialist.  The goals will be identified in the subsequent solicitation.
QUESTION:  Is the training syllabus the same one used by the IFS program? 
ANSWER:  It is anticipated the training syllabus will be similar to the IFS program.
QUESTION:  What tasks are you expecting the contractor to perform during the mobilization period? 
ANSWER:  Tentative plans are to have contractor become familiar with the site, flying patterns, maintenance area, classroom area, syllabus, and military CFIs.  Also to provide training to any IPs, conduct check rides, and establish aircraft inventory on site.
QUESTION:  Would the AF consider a 10 year contract with annual funding vice a one year contract with 9 option years? 
ANSWER:  We do not anticipate considering a 10-year contract with annual funding.
QUESTION:  Can you provide more details on your reasoning for a 4 place aircraft?  Is the aircraft going to be used for anything other than student training?  
ANSWER:  See response below for similar question.
QUESTION:  What environmental requirements will be put into the contract?  Since the aircraft requirements have changed, will the AF have to do an Environmental Assessment based on the selected aircraft?  Will this be part of the mobilization effort?  If an EA is required, what support is required of the contractor?
ANSWER:  This question is being coordinated with local Civil Engineer.
QUESTION:  Will the AF consider a termination liability clause in the contract so that if the program is cancelled before the end of the 10th year because of some factor(s) outside the contractor's control, then AF will cover some agreed to amount for the aircraft?  Obviously this reduces the contractor's risk with the AF benefiting because the overall cost of the program will be lower.
ANSWER:  The termination clauses are already established by the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
QUESTION:  Why does USAFA want a four-seat aircraft?"  Can you shed any light on that particular requirement?  I certainly couldn't.
ANSWER:  First, having a four-seat aircraft will, naturally, enable us to have someone ride along in the back.  This would be useful for instructor training / evaluations, or for students who were not schedule to fly that go to ride along and gain situational awareness.
 
Second, other than the above, our normal operations will be two people in the airplane.  The broad assumption is that having two people in a 4-place airplane will facilitate greater performance when needed or desired.

<SUBJECT>B -- Request for Information (RFI) for Net Assessment
<DESC>1.  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) is seeking comments and ideas from industry, national and government laboratories, academia and other interested parties on an assessment program, hereafter referred to as the Net Assessments (NA) program.  For the purposes of this Request for Information (RFI), the mission of the NA program is to assess the overall effectiveness of the DNDO to meet the global detection and reporting goals and objectives.  The NA program would consist of subject matter experts from various fields, including, but not limited to, radiological/nuclear detection, operations planning/mission analysis, physical security, communications and information operations, critical infrastructure, domestic and international nuclear energy and weapons complex, and information technology.  The NA program would examine plans, procedures, protocols, system integration, deployed technologies and future technologies, and identify potential current and future vulnerabilities within the overall DNDO global nuclear detection and reporting architecture.  The assessment process would seek to identify gaps in the program decisions and the assigned responsibilities of the DNDO offices and sub-offices and make recommendations to mitigate these inconsistencies. The ultimate result of these efforts would be multi-disciplinary assessment reports, both long-term (yearly or biennially) and short-term (three (3) months or less), which provide analyses of the net effectiveness of meeting DNDO global detection and reporting goals, objectives, and requirements.

2.  In response to this RFI, the Government requests that responders provide information and ideas as to the composition, in terms of staffing, technology, and management analysis tools, for an effective NA program.  Each response should address, at a minimum, the following three topics: 1) Staffing/Expertise Mix (to include the number and technical background of each team member); 2) Management/Communication (to include staffing scheduling, location, and communication issues, especially in regards to classified material and cost management); and, 3) Technology/Management Tools, (to include both information technology (e.g., for nodal and critical flow process analysis) and management tools (e.g., for tracking purposes)).  

3.  Responses should be no more than ten (10) pages, Microsoft Office 2000 compatible, and should be sent to Harrison.Smith@DHS.gov.  Hard copy responses will not be accepted.  Charts, if submitted, should be easily viewed and illustrate topics discussed in the response.  Responses should include, at a minimum, the following sections: 1) Executive Summary (one page or less); 2) a discussion of each of the three topics listed above; and, 3) a brief organizational overview (one page or less) of the responder, to include structure and size, primary products (if any), field of primary expertise, duration of involvement in the field of primary expertise, and a description of any previous multi-disciplinary assessment experience.  

4.  Note that this is not a formal request for proposal. DHS will not reimburse any preparation costs associated with responses to this RFI.

Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

d. Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
 (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. 
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—

(Continued) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 05-09. The order type is firm fixed price. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423430. The solicitation pricing on .www.FedBid.com will start on the date this solicitation is posted and will end on Friday, June 9, 2006 at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (in effect at the time quotes are due) or as otherwise displayed at .www.FedBid.com. FOB destination is Arlington, Virginia. DS/OFM requires the Oracle products and services to be procured on a brand name only basis. Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 (c), is cited at the statutory authority. The Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Office of Foreign Missions requires the Oracle licenses and first year support listed in the combined synopsis/solicitation to provide a Services Oriented Architecture ESB to the intelligence community on issues pertaining to National Security. DS/OFM requires these new licenses and support in order to provide services to intelligence agencies within and outside of the State Department. Federal, State, and Local Law Enforcement Agencies will benefit greatly from these services by receiving information pertaining to Foreign Diplomats, their dependents, and staff in a real-time environment Oracle is the Dos Information Technology Change Control Board (ITCCB) change management-approved addition of the Oracle database products to the DoS baseline. However, ITCCB approval for use within the Department doe not constitute an official endorsement of the product by the Department nor does it mean that it is mandated as the database product to be used. This approval is not to be confused with 'standardization' of a product as an authorized exception to full and open competition pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(b)(4). To date, the DoS has invested significantly in Oracle as its relational database technology to support multiple business applications, such as Diplomatic Security and Consular Affairs applications, surveillance detection database management systems, human resource applications, integrated investigative management systems, integrated personnel management systems, and medical services electronic record systems. By allowing DS/OFM the ability to obtain Oracle's SOA/BPEL software and Licensing, DS/OFM will have the opportunity to provide real-time data transfers to all Intelligence Agencies that have a need to know of the information contained within the TOMIS Database. All processes and transaction will be conducted over a secure network, utilizing an Ingrian SSL System, via a secure FTP Server. Having this flexibility allows DS/OFM the ability to transfer data outside of the State Department in a very secure manner to other agencies and provide this data in almost any format requested. The TOMIS Database currently resides on the Oracle 9i database, which will be upgraded to Oracle 10g Database prior to deploying in conjunction with the SOA/BPEL Solution. The actual use of the Oracle database application is transparent to the end user. DS requires theses licenses and support on a brand name basis in order to provide continued access to the large Oracle and Oracle-based databases that deliver customer services to DS employees at domestic and overseas locations. There are currently over 300 Oracle databases in use throughout DS. The availability, security, and integrity of these DoS information systems and data can only be ensured through the licensed use of Oracle products and services. To protect government facilities, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Office of Foreign Missions (DS/OFM) uses Oracle databases. For example, the following Oracle databases are currently deployed worldwide in support of its mission. *Personnel Security and Suitability - to ensure all DoS personnel are properly screened prior to issuance of security clearances and/or access to sensitive department information. *X-Ray Program ' to allow overseas State Department facilities to screen for explosives and other harmful materials. *Vehicle Barrier ' to provide specialized technical assistance and repair services for vehicle barriers at DoS facilities overseas. *Explosive Detection ' prevents the prospect of a terrorist attack by deterring or detecting an attempt to use explosive devices. *TOMIS ' to allow State Department entities, around the world, the ability to access and view the Foreign Diplomatic community Privileges and Immunities granted by the United States. All of these systems undergo rigorous test and evaluation, certification and accreditation, user acceptance, and ITCCB approval before deployment to DoS users. In addition, there is a significant investment in developing technical documentation and training courseware and providing the training to users, system administrators, developers, and maintainers. To re-create this process and provide the deliverables for another product would require a significant investment of time and funds in addition to the license/maintenance costs of keeping the existing databases operational until the security and supportability of the replacement product could be assured. Therefore, these requirements preclude consideration of a product manufactured by another company.

Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours. These  gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5). Main Gate is open 24  hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained. All commercial vehicles will be searched. The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post. The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to re ach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis. If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given prio rity for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehic le will be given priority. On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12 foot-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate. Drivers n eeding access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12 feet-5inches in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis. The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label. The Contr actor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.

If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a f ast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee. c. If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change. If the identifica tion badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.

<DESC>The amendment to the original notice is to provide the SOW for this requirement:

1.0 Introduction

1.1 Organization
Identification:
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Veterinary Services (VS), Center for Epidemiology and Animal Health (CEAH), and the Center for Emerging Issues (CEI).

Address:
USDA: APHIS: VS: CEAH: CEI
Natural Resources Research Center, Building B
2150 Centre Ave, Mail Stop 2W4
Fort Collins, Colorado 80526-8117

1.2 Organization Mission
Veterinary Services (VS) protects and improves the health, quality, and marketability of our nation's animals, animal products and veterinary biologics by:
•Preventing, controlling and/or eliminating animal diseases.
•Monitoring and promoting animal health and productivity.

Veterinary Services is part of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).  APHIS was created on April 2, 1972, as a science-based organization whose primary goal is protecting American agriculture, and is an integral part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) efforts to provide the Nation with safe and affordable food.  APHIS' mission is to provide leadership in ensuring the health and care of animals and plants, to improve agricultural productivity and competitiveness, and to contribute to the national economy and the public health by:
•Safeguarding resources from exotic invasive pests and diseases.
•Monitoring and managing agricultural pests and diseases existing in the United States.
•Resolving and managing trade issues related to animal or plant health.
•Ensuring the humane care and treatment of animals.

2.0 Scope
This purchase order will include all requirements to provide capabilities for an application that generates agriculturally-realistic place-based datasets for the Avian Influenza Modeling Project.  This is a required module for the AI Modeling project.  The datasets and spatial products generated are based on the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Census of Agriculture.

2.1 Project Background and Objective
2.1.1 Background
A requirement of the Avian Influenza Modeling Project is geospatially realistic data.  A limitation in performing disease simulation models is the availability of data concerning the specific location of farms.  Because of privacy concerns, actual locations of poultry facilities are not publicly available.  Generating representations of known agricultural demographics for input into the AI Modeling Project is currently a manual process that is time consuming and computationally intensive.  

The Farm Animal Demographics Simulator would be an application designed to create agriculturally and geographically realistic datasets for the Avian Influenza Modeling Project.  The Farm Animal Demographics Simulator would use National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Census of Agriculture data to estimate the number and sizes of poultry facilities within a geographic region (e.g., counties or states).  Over the region of interest, a geographic constraint is applied so that facilities are not located in urban areas, in lakes, parks, natural areas, or other locations where they are not likely to occur.  Facilities are located randomly, unless a weight matrix is used to concentrate certain types of farms closer to urban areas, live animal markets, and feed suppliers.  Numbers of birds are randomly assigned to the simulated facilities in accordance with the NASS data.

Because states are not required to report their animal numbers to NASS, there is a fair amount of missing data in the publicly available Census of Agriculture. Part of the functionality of the Farm Animal Demographics Simulator would be to estimate the missing county-level data.
	
The Farm Animal Demographics Simulator is a required module for the Avian Influenza Modeling project.  It would allow the analysts to generate geospatially realistic poultry datasets and maps either via a desktop or internet application with minimal human intervention.

2.2 Description
This purchase order consists of the tasks listed below, but is summarized in this section.  The offeror will work with CEAH staff, including the Avian Influenza Modeling analysts, in implementing core functionality for the application to generate data inputs to the model.

2.3 Implementation tasks include:
Module 1: Research Tools Available For Completing Subsequent Modules Investigate, evaluate, and select the appropriate development tool(s) (ArcMap toolbar extension, ArcEngine, ArcServer, Java, Ajax, etc.) for completing the subsequent modules (primarily Modules 3 and 4).   The selected solution must fulfill the following application requirements for the Avian Influenza Modeling Project:

•Ability to dynamically generate a random number of geographic point locations that simulate the number of poultry facilities for a particular region (e.g., state) as in the NASS Census of Agriculture data
•Ability to dynamically assign random number of birds to each location that simulate  bird population categories in the NASS Census of Agriculture 
•Ability to generate a national mask layer (polygon) of geographically feasible poultry facility locations (one time, static)
•Ability to estimate missing values in the NASS data based on values in neighboring regions (possibly dynamic)
•Ability to save generated dynamic layers in shapefile format
•Ability to export the data tables in comma separated format required for input into other modules of the Avian Influenza Modeling Project
•Possible non-critical functionality: buffering of features, cluster analysis, addition of user defined layers
•Report quality printing
•Ability to save outputs in common graphics formats (e.g. Adobe PDF, jpeg, png)
•Works in a LAN environment
•If desktop client software is used, it installs easily using an install shield or something similar on a users PC or could function as an intranet client with no installation required
•If application is server based, it must be able to handle multiple simultaneous requests

Module 2: Generation of Static Data Layers
•Offeror will work closely with the CEAH staff, including the Avian Influenza Modeling group, to generate a static national level mask layer of geographically realistic poultry facility locations
•Mask layer is based on geographic parameters such as a defined distance from roadways, and not located in urban areas, lakes, parks, etc.
•Offeror will work closely with CEAH staff and the AI Modeling group to formulate methodology for estimating the missing values in the NASS data
•Other static base layers (roads, water features, state/county boundaries, etc.) will be provided by CEAH staff

Module 3:  Generation of Dynamic Data Layers
•Dynamic data layers are based on farm size category numbers in the NASS Census of agriculture
•A random number of point locations will be generated based on the NASS total number of farms for each county in a particular state
•Next, randomly sized bird populations are assigned to each point based on NASS farm size categories for each county

Module 4: User Interface and Outputs
•Avian Influenza Modeling group analysts will be able to generate multiple dynamic data layers (from Module 3)
•User interface will include common mapping functionality such as panning, zooming, activating/deactivating layers, etc.
•User interface will include a table of contents and a map data frame
•Application will generate the dynamic data layers in shapefile format
•Application will be able to export generated maps to common graphics formats such as, Adobe PDF, JPEG, png
•Application will generate report quality printouts
•Application will export datasets in comma separated format required for input into other components of the AI Modeling Project

Module 5:  Documentation and Beta Testing
•Formal system and user documentation that follow the CEAH standards and examples. Documentation should be tied to training and educational needs.
•The offeror shall provide extensive testing to ensure proper functionality.   The offeror shall develop a comprehensive test plan to ensure application performs as expected.  Testing and debugging will be performed by working closely with the CEAH staff.  Corrections and necessary changes will be implemented within 15 business days.
