<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list for this procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>Upon approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>
<p>Firms should request a DOE (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit a completed one-time NATO ICB application) by: 19 January 2015</p>
<p>Please note, however, that HQ SACT will accept nominations to the bidders list (DOEs) past the nomination deadline and up to the bid closing date.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Office of Acquisition and Agreements Management (OAAM), on behalf of the Microscopy and Microanalysis Research Group (MMRG) within the Material Measurement Laboratory (MML), intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with Coherent Laser Group of Santa Clara, CA under the authority of 41 US 253(c)(1) - only one responsible source, for an upgrade to an existing Coherent MIRA 900 D laser system including installation, training, and a one year warranty. <br /><br />The MMRG conducts research on the development of innovative metrologies and measurement protocols for micro/nano-scale heterosystems analysis. Measurement techniques are used to determine sample composition as well as structural, electronic, and chemical properties of a wide variety of organic, inorganic and biomolecular systems where materials of interest are typically present as either micro/nano-scale features or monolayer/multilayer films. The MMRG is striving to make improvements in the technology of measurement tools and techniques for the microanalysis of materials systems (i.e. imaging and analysis of inorganic/organic nanostructure and morphology). A fundamental tool utilized to fulfill MMRG's mission is the aforementioned MIRA 900 D laser system. <br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Basis for Sole Source:</span></strong><br />In order to further fulfill MMRG's mission, it is necessary procure an upgrade to its existing laser system with parts that are 100% compatible and interchangeable with the system. Specifically, a PulseSwitch Cavity Dumper (dual) and a Second Harmonic Generation (dual), which are both manufactured by Coherent Laser Group. This upgrade will enable repetition rates down from the system's current 76 MHz to a variable repetition rate of 1 Hz to 54 MHz. The purchase of this laser system upgrade is necessary to permit the imaging and analysis of chemically complex samples such as organic/inorganic nano-composites, biofilms, compacted powders, and fibers. Coherent has developed the required technology, has proprietary rights to the technology, and has no authorized distributors or resellers capable of providing the technology.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The Small Business Size standard is 500 employees.<br /><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on January 13, 2014 will be considered by the Government.<br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />

<DESC>This procurement is a set aside for small business authorized resellers of the manufacturer Informatica Corporaton product "Informatica Data Quality Advanced Edition 4-Core (licenses and software maintenance support). Provided below is the Justification and approval for other than full and open competition (Brand Name ONLY). The solicitaion SAQMMA15Q0051 is issued as Request For Quotation (RFQ) and will be posted within the hour. This is an urgent procurement and must be awarded prior to January 1, 2015. Details regarding submission of the quotes will be addressed in the solicitation.
<p><br />&nbsp;JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&amp;A)<br /><br /><br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State, is processing this Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) for the purchase of new Informatica Data Quality Advanced Edition 4-core that includes licenses, and software support services on behalf of Information Resource, Systems Integration Office (IRM/OPS/SIO). The estimated cost is $210,000.00.</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved. The Informatica Data Quality Advanced Edition 4-core will be incorporated into the Department existing Informatica Data Integration suite, with updated software (paragraph 3 provides details). The authority to be used in the procurement of this commercial software will be Subpart 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.</p>
<p>3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the Department's needs.</p>
<p>The Department requires purchase of Informatica Data Quality Advanced Edition Suite for incorporation into the existing Informatica data integration suite, with updated software. The Advanced Edition 4-core software will improve data quality, data profiling, and data matching during the extract, transform, and load processes to integrate data from various sources across the department into the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW). This acquisition will ensure that the EDW continues to integrate data from multiple sources into meaningful information accessible to and used by Posts world-wide, which will enable expeditious response to internal and external data calls, as well as, facilitate data driven decision-making.</p>
<p>The initial product/software is already utilized at both Domestic and at Post world-wide. If the updated software is not purchased, the Department could lose the use of the licenses, and software support will stop. Importantly, it is certain that the Department's current informatica data suite risk not being able to provide accurate, current, and complete data, placing many programs at risk and financial loss.</p>
<p>4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. <br /><br />41 USC 253&copy;(1), FAR 6.302-1, FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. <br /><br />The Informatica product is used to build data quality metrics, help identify data quality issues during the ETL process, and improve workflows to integrate data from multiple enterprise level systems. This product provides full integration to the existing EDW architecture. Use of any other product would require the program office to redesign and recreate the EDW architecture which is not cost affective at this time.</p>
<p>6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable <br /><br />A FedBizOpps notice will be publicized as required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and FAR 6.302-1(c )(A)(B)(C). This justification covers only the portion of the acquisition which is brand name or peculiar to one manufacturer. The product is The Informatica Data Quality Advanced Edition 4-cor manufactured only by Informatica Corporation. Therefore, the justification and approval is for this basis only.</p>
<p>7. A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will make a fair and reasonable price determination in accordance with FAR 13.106.3. The manufacturer Informatica Corporation offers' this product to the general public. This product/software is for commercial use, including support and the price list is also published.</p>
<p>8. A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted. <br /><br />A market survey was conducted by the IRM/ SIO Office, evaluating the capabilities of other software companies when the initial software was purchased from Informatica Corporation. ISO researched the internet of the products available on the market, and finally, three separate in-person meetings which included a demonstration of three different products were conducted. However, although a market survey has been conducted previously, it's essential to the Government's requirements, to preclude consideration of a product manufactured by another company.</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are used as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been identified as the only products that will meet the Department's requirements to continue to be seamlessly and without interruption or delay provide interactive training materials online, webinars, remote meetings and online sessions.</p>
<p>10. A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>No other sources have expressed interest in writing or otherwise in this acquisition.</p>
<p>11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.</p>

Background &amp; Introduction<br />About PBGC<br />The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) was established to develop and administer the pension plan insurance programs as provided in Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974. PBGC's mission is primarily to: 1) encourage the continuation and maintenance of voluntary private pension plans for the benefit of their participants, 2) provide for the timely and uninterrupted payment of pension benefits to participants and beneficiaries under plans to which Title IV applies, and 3) maintain PBGC insurance premiums at the lowest level consistent with carrying out it's obligations under Title IV. <br />ERISA established two insurance programs to be administered by PBGC. The single-employer (SE) program covers plans maintained by one employer, or by a group of employers, but not pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. The multiemployer program (ME) covers plans that are collectively bargained and cover the employees of two or more unrelated employers. Each insurance program is operated and financed separately from the other, and assets from one cannot be used to support the other. <br />6.1 PIMS Background<br />By coverage, the single-employer program is by far the larger of the two programs, insuring about 33.4 million workers and retirees covered by nearly 26,000 plans. The SE program guarantees payment of benefits, subject to limits set by law. If an insured plan terminates without enough money to pay all benefits, then PBGC trustees the plan, takes over any assets and assumes the responsibility to pay plan participants. As of September 30, 2011, PBGC has trusteed more than 4,200 terminated single-employer plans and assumed responsibility for the benefits of nearly 1.4 million workers and retirees. In fiscal year 2012, PBGC paid a total of nearly $5.4 billion in benefits, and by the end of the year it was paying retirement benefits to more than 775,000 people each month. <br />There are about 1,500 multiemployer plans that cover more than 10.1 million workers and retirees. Unlike the single-employer program, under which PBGC guarantees payment of benefits upon termination of an underfunded plan, under the multiemployer program, PBGC guarantees payment of benefits if a covered plan is insolvent and unable to pay basic PBGC guaranteed benefits when due. Also unlike the single-employer program, insolvent multiemployer plans are not trusteed by PBGC. Rather PBGC financially assists insolvent plans to enable them to continue paying guaranteed benefits themselves. As of September 30, 2012, PBGC has provided $788 million in total financial assistance, net of repayments, to 74 multiemployer plans. Only one plan has ever repaid PBGC.</p>
<p>Single-Employer (SE) PIMS- What is now PBGC's Policy Research &amp; Analysis Department (PRAD) began development of the Pension Insurance Modeling System (PIMS) for the single-employer insurance program (SE PIMS) in 1992. The initial version went into production in 1997. SE PIMS is a stochastic (i.e., random) simulation model that PBGC uses to evaluate its exposure and likelihood of future claims and to quantify the amount of risk facing the single-employer insurance program. SE PIMS portrays PBGC's future financial condition as a function of a variety of economic parameters. <br />SE PIMS' has over 30,000 lines of computer code written in C++ programming language and is currently run under Windows 7. The input database for the model includes significant details on a sample of nearly 460 pension plans, key financial variables from approximately 350 companies that sponsor those pension plans, details on the PBGC's current assets and benefit payment obligations, and recent history of key financial market returns. Pension plan and actuarial data is taken from the Form 5500, the Schedule SB (MB for Multiemployer PIMS, see below) and attachments, and includes benefit formulae, age-service matrices of active workers, number of retirees, benefit payouts, actuarial assumptions, and schedules of amortization bases..<br />The program simulates thousands of random scenarios of potential future outcomes using a pseudo-random number generator and measures of the volatility of key variables and the correlation among them. The scenarios projected in the simulation extend up to 20 years into the future. In each year of a scenario, the program simulates: <br />1. Annual returns of stock and bond market indices; changes to the financial variables of each plan sponsor;<br />2. Changes to each pension plan's liabilities reflecting advancements in age and service, as well as retirements and other employment separations, among the active participants, hiring and retirement rates consistent with changes to sponsors' total employment levels, advancement in ages and mortality rates among the retired population, benefit and/or salary level increases, and changes to valuation discount rates;<br />Changes to the asset level of each plan, including asset returns determined by plans' portfolio selections and the simulated market returns, benefit payments to retired participants, and contributions from the plan sponsor meeting the constraints of Internal Revenue Code funding rules;<br />3. Random occurrences of bankruptcy among the pension plan sponsors, with bankruptcy probabilities being determined by each firm's financial variables, and calculation of whether the funding levels of plans sponsored by bankrupt firms implies a claim on the PBGC; and<br />4. Changes to PBGC assets and liabilities which reflect premium payments from plan sponsors, benefit payments to trusteed beneficiaries, asset returns and changes to liability discount rates, age advancement and mortality among beneficiaries, and new claims presented by underfunded plans of bankrupt firms.<br />The program stores output on key variables related to pension funding and PBGC assets and liabilities. The output is analyzed by the PBGC to develop probability distributions over the range of financial outcomes the PBGC could experience in the future.<br />The actuarial component of the program, which tracks plans' liabilities, assets and contribution requirements through time, represents the most significant component of the model in terms of programming detail and complexity. It is also the component that is the focus for continued development/enhancement of the model.<br />PBGC uses SE PIMS to satisfy statutory requirements under ERISA Section 4008 as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA of 2006) to produce annually, an actuarial evaluation of PBGC's expected operations for the next five years for publication in PBGC's annual report. PBGC has chosen in the past to extend this projection to ten and twenty years instead of the required five. PPA of 2006 requires that PBGC's annual report also include a summary of SE PIMS, "including the specific simulation parameters, specific initial values, temporal parameters, and policy parameters used to calculate the financial statements for the corporation." SE PIMS is updated regularly for legislative, regulatory and/or policy changes. The model was critical to the legislative processes that led to enactment of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, PPA of 2006 and the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, having been used to evaluate the financial impact upon ongoing pension plans, their sponsors and participants, PBGC and the Federal budget of numerous and varied legislative proposals considered by the Executive and Legislative branches, the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).<br />PBGC has also used SE PIMS at the request of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and other Federal agencies/Departments to conduct special analyses to assess the financial condition of PBGC's single-employer program and evaluate legislative/regulatory/policy alternatives to eliminating PBGC's long-term single-employer deficit.</p>
<p>Multiemployer PIMS- The companion version of PIMS to model PBGC's multiemployer insurance program (ME PIMS) was first implemented in 2009.<br />ME PIMS has been used to provide the same types of analyses for the Multiemployer program, as SE PIMS does for the single-employer program and to satisfy PBGC's statutory requirement under Section 4022 of ERISA to conduct quinquennial (once every five years) studies of the multiemployer insurance program to determine the adequacy of multiemployer premium rates and benefit guarantees.<br />ME-PIMS shares many of the aforementioned features of SE-PIMS, as well as reflecting fundamental differences between the single-employer and multiemployer programs, including:<br />1. a different universe of plans - ME-PIMS currently contains data for roughly 250 multiemployer pension plans, but this is expected to expand significantly;<br />2. the failure-pattern for multiemployer plans: typically mass withdrawal of sponsorship followed by insolvency, rather than bankruptcy of a single-employer sponsor;<br />3. the unavailability of financial data from individual sponsors of most multiemployer plans, and the resultant need for stochastic modeling of the mass withdrawal event to use variables describing the condition of the plan rather than of its sponsors;<br />4. the collective bargaining framework of multiemployer plans, in which employer contribution rates are collectively bargained;<br />5. the ERISA environment, where multiemployer plans have their own rules concerning cost methods (traditional methods still used under PPA), amortization periods, special calculations associated with Reorganization status, and Funding Improvement and Rehabilitation plans, associated with Endangered and Critical statuses, under PPA;<br />6. special computations for the Withdrawal Liability payments owed by sponsors who discontinue making contributions to a plan (individually or en masse);<br />7. different benefit levels, than single employer plans, guaranteed by PBGC;<br />8. different PBGC premium levels than single employer plans pay; and<br />9. a different obligation toward failed plans than the single-employer model of sponsor-bankruptcy and PBGC-trusteeship: in the multiemployer realm PBGC pays enough cash assistance to allow insolvent plans to continue functioning as ongoing (if wasting) trusts, receiving withdrawal liability payments from former sponsors and continuing to pay benefits to participants;<br />10. different measurement criteria for booking claims against PBGC, which are computed as present value of future financial assistance, booked when plans are in mass withdrawal and within 20 years of insolvency, or when they are ongoing but within 10 years of insolvency, and removed from PBGC's books if they emerge from these criteria.</p>
<p>As with SE PIMS, the actuarial component of the ME PIMS program, which tracks plans' liabilities, assets and contribution requirements through time, represents the most significant component of the model in terms of programming detail and complexity. It is also one of the components that is the likely focus for continued development/enhancement of ME PIMS.<br />7 Objective &amp; Scope of Work<br />The overall objective of this acquisition is to provide the government with a high level analysis of PIMS with a focus on replacement or upgrade, while incorporating microsimulation best practices.</p>
<p>The specific goal of this effort is to provide detailed alternatives analysis services using detailed alternatives analysis techniques and methodologies in alignment with the PBGC Information Technology Solutions Life Cycle Management and existing relevant policies (e.g., OMB Circulars A-11, A-94). Business drivers include the following PIMS program initiatives:<br />&bull; Technology Updates: Position PIMS to avoid becoming obsolete and meeting participant needs via enhancements and technology upgrades.<br />&bull; Accountability: Maintain and Unqualified Audit Opinion<br />7.1 Activities<br />At a minimum, the contractor is expected to perform, the following activities:<br />1. Evaluate the PIMS models and provide recommendations to improve;<br />- Model governance<br />- Procedures and processes<br />- Programming platform and structures<br />- Documentations<br />- Input data sources<br />- Risks mitigation<br />2. Identify and recommend commercially available software as replacement components for PIMS<br />- Sample components: Economic scenarios generator, random number generator, actuarial functions calculator....<br />3. Provide recommendations on future generations of PIMS<br />- Options to upgrade or replace the models<br />- Steps to improve/upgrade the models<br />4. Evaluate comparable micro-simulation models with similar focus <br />- Determine best practices from these models<br />- Illustrate how recommendations provided minimize risks and steer PIMS towards best practices<br />5. Perform benefits analysis for each alternative to include qualitative benefits, cost savings, cost avoidance, stakeholder benefits and non-monetary quantitative benefits. <br />6. At the conclusion of the study period, PBGC expects to receive from the Analysis, at least four (4) different alternatives regarding the development and modernization of PIMS at the component level (not for the whole system) as driven by the PBGC Architectural Analysis Recommendations Report and Modernization Roadmap for PIMS. The resulting outputs of these activities will be used as supporting documentation inputs for the Options Analysis of PIMS, which will be used for making decisions for information technology solution investments. The following list includes alternative options that should be explored: <br />a) Maintain the Status Quo (required) - This alternative recommends that maintaining the current state is the favorable alternative<br />b) Government Service Provider or Federal Line of Business - This alternative recommends that PBGC should partner with a separate agency as a service provider in order to leverage existing services possessed by a government entity<br />c) Partial Commercial off the Shelf COTS with Customization - Replace all or a portion of PIMS with a product with a commercial off the shelf solution with customization as needed to support the business process<br />d) Build Custom - This alternative recommends that PBGC complete all work in-house<br />7.2 Notes<br />This acquisition may result in the contractor providing information that can be used as specifications for future government requirements. Due to this the successful bidder may not be able to bid on future requirements resulting out of the deliverables from this acquisition. See FAR 9.505-2.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance is three calendar months. <br />8.0 Deliverables &amp; Work Products<br />PBGC expects the contractor will deliver the following artifacts. In addition, PBGC expects the contractor to provide in its proposal the completion dates for each of the artifacts. PBGC anticipates these artifacts (deliverables and work products) will include:<br />&bull; Detailed Alternatives Analysis Report: The contractor shall furnish documentation supporting the alternatives analysis that will describe the methodology used in identifying viable alternative solutions. It also shall identify all the data sources and any information used in the analysis. The documentation should be in sufficient detail to permit reviewers to follow the logic from assumptions to conclusion. Alternatives and Analysis deliverables at minimum should include the following area: <br />o Description of the alternative solutions considered for accomplishing the strategic goals for PBGC.<br />o The specification of all assumptions, ground rules and constraints, assumed or imposed, underlying the analysis. Each must each be explained with adequate rationale.<br />o Summary of the market research that was conducted to identify innovative solutions for this investment (e.g., obtained four different solutions to evaluate, held open meetings with contractors to discuss investment scope, etc.).<br />o Justification for the selected alternatives (including how each of the alternatives was judged according to specific criteria related to PBGC business needs and which permits a comparison of the relative merits and drawbacks of each alternative).<br />o Date of the analysis.<br />&bull; Project Management Plan: The Project Management Plan (PMP) shall include the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), timeline and key milestones, risks and mitigation strategy. It will be used to support the Weekly Project Status Report.<br />&bull; Meeting Agendas/Minutes: This document will be used to capture meeting agendas, attendees, meeting highlights, meeting outcomes and meeting action items.<br />&bull; Approval Form: Approval form that documents all project deliverables that were completed as part of the project and documents the date of each deliverable.<br />&bull; Project Modification Requests (if needed): Form used to document changes to project scope, cost and schedule.

<DESC><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is <strong>NOT</strong> a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding:&nbsp; 1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; 2) whether they are small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses, 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, or small disadvantaged businesses; and 3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541712.<br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND<br /></strong><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking a Central Laboratory for an ongoing program - the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study III (REDS-III). The objective of REDS-III is to assure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S., affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S., but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. The REDS-III program is comprised of one Central Laboratory, one Data Coordinating Center, four Domestic Hubs, and three International collaborative sites in Brazil, China, and South Africa.<br /><br />REDS-III contractors are currently completing Phase 2 of the contract, conducting several study protocols and compiling donor, recipient, and linked databases, and performing laboratory testing. The NHLBI anticipates that the Central Laboratory will be needed until March 14, 2020 to complete the development, review and approval of analyses, presentations and publications based on the research conducted in Phase 2, as well as closure of databases. <br /><br /><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS<br /><br /></strong>During the period from September 15, 2017 - March 14, 2020, the Central Laboratory (CL) is expected to provide the necessary technical expertise and facilities to effectively perform the tasks and meet the requirements identified below:<br /><br />1. The Principal Investigator of the Central Laboratory shall serve as a voting member of the REDS-III International Advisory Committee.<br />As a member of the International Advisory Committee, actively participate in the review and approval of the REDS-III International study portfolio and evaluate program progress to ensure that the overall objectives of the REDS-III program are being met.<br /><br />2. The Principal Investigator of the Central Laboratory shall serve as a voting member of the REDS-III Domestic Steering Committee and each International Steering Committee.<br />As a member of the Domestic Steering Committee and each International Steering Committee (and their subcommittees, as appropriate), provide technical laboratory expertise and serve as an active participant in developing and prioritizing REDS-III domestic and international research activities, in overseeing and ensuring the progress of ongoing studies, and in developing, reviewing and approving analyses, presentations, and publications. <br /><br />3. The Central Laboratory shall contribute in presenting study data in the form of presentations at scientific meetings and publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals.<br /><br />4. The Central Laboratory shall coordinate with the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) to provide containers to the REDS-III domestic hubs and international sites for shipment of biospecimens to the CL. For the Domestic hubs, the CL shall bear the cost for shipping biospecimens from the hubs to the CL or other testing sites, and for shipping residual volume back to the CL for storage, as appropriate per protocol specifications. For international sites, the CL shall bear the cost for shipping biospecimens from the sites to the CL or other testing sites in the U.S., and for shipping residual volume back to the CL for storage, as appropriate per protocol specifications. The international sites shall be responsible for the costs associated with shipping biospecimens to in-country testing facilities and for the costs of storage of biospecimens that are not shipped to the U.S.<br /><br />5. In accordance with REDS-III study protocols, the Central Laboratory shall perform infectious disease, molecular, genetic, immunological, and hematological tests such as antigen, antibody, and nucleic acid assays for infectious agents, testing for human leukocyte antigens (HLA), testing for products with immunomodulatory, pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory properties such as cytokines and chemokines, characterization of leukocyte populations with immunoregulatory properties, etc. It is expected that most testing in the U.S. shall be performed by the CL. For those assays that are better conducted by other testing facilities, the CL shall be responsible for arranging and managing the necessary subcontracts with each U.S. testing facility.<br /><br />6. Transmit laboratory test results electronically to the DCC in an acceptable format within the timeframe specified in the study-specific Manual of Operations. Results from any quality control assessments specified in protocols shall be transmitted to the DCC.<br /><br />7. Store biospecimens from participating hubs according to study protocols. Biospecimens shall be stored at the CL until no longer needed. If the biospecimens and associated genotypic and/or phenotypic data may be of value for further study by the scientific community, the REDS-III Domestic and International Steering Committees can consider submitting applications to the NHLBI for consideration to transfer biospecimen collections to the NHLBI Biologic Specimen Repository for long-term storage and access by the scientific community. Shipping costs from the CL to the NHLBI Biologic Specimen Repository shall be borne by the NHLBI Biorepository. <br /><br />8. Participate in all committee and subcommittee meetings, conference calls, and organizational training sessions of which the Principal Investigator and laboratory staff are members. <br /><br /><strong>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS<br /></strong><br />The Government intends to negotiate (1) cost reimbursement task order for the period of September 15, 2017 - March 14, 2020.<br /><br /><strong>CAPABILITY STATEMENT - HOW TO SUBMIT A RESPONSE <br /></strong><br />Small businesses that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this work should submit complete documentation of their capabilities to the Contracting Officer.

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement.<br /><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br /><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking a Central Laboratory for an ongoing program - the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study III (REDS-III). The objective of REDS-III is to assure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S., affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S., but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. The REDS-III program is comprised of one Central Laboratory, one Data Coordinating Center, four Domestic Hubs, and three International collaborative sites in Brazil, China, and South Africa.<br /><br />REDS-III contractors are currently completing Phase 2 of the contract, conducting several study protocols and compiling donor, recipient, and linked databases, and performing laboratory testing. The NHLBI anticipates that the Central Laboratory will be needed until March 14, 2020 to complete the development, review and approval of analyses, presentations and publications based on the research conducted in Phase 2, as well as closure of databases. <br /><br /><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS<br /></strong><br />During the period from September 15, 2017 - March 14, 2020, the Central Laboratory (CL) is expected to provide the necessary technical expertise and facilities to effectively perform the tasks and meet the requirements identified below:<br /><br />1. The Principal Investigator of the Central Laboratory shall serve as a voting member of the REDS-III International Advisory Committee.<br />As a member of the International Advisory Committee, actively participate in the review and approval of the REDS-III International study portfolio and evaluate program progress to ensure that the overall objectives of the REDS-III program are being met.<br /><br />2. The Principal Investigator of the Central Laboratory shall serve as a voting member of the REDS-III Domestic Steering Committee and each International Steering Committee.<br />As a member of the Domestic Steering Committee and each International Steering Committee (and their subcommittees, as appropriate), provide technical laboratory expertise and serve as an active participant in developing and prioritizing REDS-III domestic and international research activities, in overseeing and ensuring the progress of ongoing studies, and in developing, reviewing and approving analyses, presentations, and publications. <br /><br />3. The Central Laboratory shall contribute in presenting study data in the form of presentations at scientific meetings and publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals.<br /><br />4. The Central Laboratory shall coordinate with the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) to provide containers to the REDS-III domestic hubs and international sites for shipment of biospecimens to the CL. For the Domestic hubs, the CL shall bear the cost for shipping biospecimens from the hubs to the CL or other testing sites, and for shipping residual volume back to the CL for storage, as appropriate per protocol specifications. For international sites, the CL shall bear the cost for shipping biospecimens from the sites to the CL or other testing sites in the U.S., and for shipping residual volume back to the CL for storage, as appropriate per protocol specifications. The international sites shall be responsible for the costs associated with shipping biospecimens to in-country testing facilities and for the costs of storage of biospecimens that are not shipped to the U.S.<br /><br />5. In accordance with REDS-III study protocols, the Central Laboratory shall perform infectious disease, molecular, genetic, immunological, and hematological tests such as antigen, antibody, and nucleic acid assays for infectious agents, testing for human leukocyte antigens (HLA), testing for products with immunomodulatory, pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory properties such as cytokines and chemokines, characterization of leukocyte populations with immunoregulatory properties, etc. It is expected that most testing in the U.S. shall be performed by the CL. For those assays that are better conducted by other testing facilities, the CL shall be responsible for arranging and managing the necessary subcontracts with each U.S. testing facility.<br /><br />6. Transmit laboratory test results electronically to the DCC in an acceptable format within the timeframe specified in the study-specific Manual of Operations. Results from any quality control assessments specified in protocols shall be transmitted to the DCC.<br /><br />7. Store biospecimens from participating hubs according to study protocols. Biospecimens shall be stored at the CL until no longer needed. If the biospecimens and associated genotypic and/or phenotypic data may be of value for further study by the scientific community, the REDS-III Domestic and International Steering Committees can consider submitting applications to the NHLBI for consideration to transfer biospecimen collections to the NHLBI Biologic Specimen Repository for long-term storage and access by the scientific community. Shipping costs from the CL to the NHLBI Biologic Specimen Repository shall be borne by the NHLBI Biorepository. <br /><br />8. Participate in all committee and subcommittee meetings, conference calls, and organizational training sessions of which the Principal Investigator and laboratory staff are members. <br /><br /><strong>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS<br /></strong><br />The Government intends to negotiate (1) cost reimbursement task order for the period of September 15, 2017 - March 14, 2020.<br /><br /><strong>CAPABILITY STATEMENT - HOW TO SUBMIT A RESPONSE<br /></strong><br />Organizations that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this work should submit complete documentation of their capabilities to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC><br />This is a Research and Development (R &amp; D) Sources Sought notice. This is <strong>NOT</strong> a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement.
<p><strong><br />BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking four (4) Domestic Hubs for an ongoing program - the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study III (REDS-III). The objective of REDS-III is to assure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S., affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S., but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. The REDS-III program is comprised of one Central Laboratory, one Data Coordinating Center, four Domestic Hubs, and three International collaborative sites in Brazil, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>REDS-III contractors are currently completing Phase 2 of the contract, conducting several study protocols and compiling donor, recipient, and linked databases, and performing laboratory testing. The NHLBI anticipates that the Domestic Hubs will be needed until March 14, 2020 to complete the development, review and approval of analyses, presentations and publications based on the research conducted in Phase 2, as well as closure of databases.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>During the period from September 15, 2017 - March 14, 2020, each of the four Domestic Hubs is expected to provide the necessary technical expertise and facilities to effectively perform the tasks and meet the requirements identified below:</p>
<p>1. The hub Principal Investigator shall serve as a member of the REDS-III Oversight Committee.<br />As a member of the Oversight Committee, actively collaborate and participate in the review and approval of the REDS-III Domestic and International study portfolios as well as evaluate program progress to ensure that the objectives of the REDS-III program are being met.</p>
<p>2. The hub Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator shall serve as voting members of the REDS-III Domestic Steering Committee.<br />As members of the Domestic Steering Committee (and its subcommittees, as appropriate), serve as active participants in developing and prioritizing all REDS-III domestic research activities, in overseeing and ensuring the progress of ongoing studies, and in developing, reviewing and approving analyses, presentations, and publications. Collaborate with other hubs to develop a REDS-III domestic program portfolio that will advance transfusion medicine.</p>
<p>3. The hub shall participate in, coordinate, and successfully conduct the REDS-III research protocols that have been approved by the REDS-III Domestic Steering Committee. <br />Performance shall be in accordance with study protocols. Provide strong, proactive leadership in dealing with all required hospital services, outpatient services (as appropriate), and the blood center to ensure successful conduct of all research protocols. Coordinate research efforts across hub participants. Obtain all necessary administrative and regulatory clearances. Adhere to all relevant provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Incorporate study protocols into blood center/hospital's operations as needed. Contact and enroll participants in study protocols, conduct blood/medical record review, and conduct follow-up visits as required per study protocols. Collect and transmit all data to the DCC as required by each protocol using a data management system provided by the DCC. Collect, process, and ship biospecimens according to protocol specifications. Field all inquiries related to REDS-III research studies. Data shall be analyzed centrally by the REDSIII DCC.</p>
<p>4. The hub shall serve as a Centralized Data Collection Center (CCC).<br />The CCC shall be responsible for obtaining and transmitting donor/donation/component and patient data to the DCC. Obtain all necessary administrative and regulatory clearances. Adhere to all relevant provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). All hub CCCs shall capture the same donor/donation/component and patient data elements as defined by the Domestic Steering Committee and described in the REDS-III Operating Procedures and Manuals of Operations using a data management system provided to each hub by the DCC. The CCC shall also conduct quality-checks on the data. The CCC shall be responsible for collecting all hub data, transmitting the data to the DCC, and providing the necessary IT and data management expertise to:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; a. Conduct quality-checks on the donor/donation/component data files provided by the participating blood center and by additional blood suppliers or by large blood collection systems, if proposed; and collect additional information on the processing of components that may have occurred at the transfusion service/hospital before infusion into recipients. Donor/donation/component data are comprehensive. Data shall include information on all donations collected at the participating blood center(s) including information on non-transfused and transfused donations and their components, some of which are supplied to the hub's participating hospitals. Data shall not include identifying information such as donor's name, social security number, address, etc. but shall include a unique study identification number (ID) for each donor with each donation record, allowing the donor to be longitudinally followed and their individual donations and components identified in the central databases that shall be maintained by the DCC. Data must include screening and confirmatory test results, demographic information, component manufacturing and processing information, and other information as determined by the Domestic Steering Committee. The files including donation/donor/component data are to be provided by the CCC to the DCC in an electronic format in a timely manner for compilation into a central database and for analysis. This information shall be considered a deliverable to the DCC at specified intervals.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;b. Collect and enter data on patients that were transfused as well as those considered for transfusion i.e., cross-matched while admitted at participating hospital services (intensive care unit(s), cardiac surgery, orthopedic surgery, oncology/cancer center, and trauma services) and outpatient services, as appropriate. These data shall be retrospectively collected without identifying information (such as name, social security number, address, etc.) on cross-matched adult patients as specified by the REDS-III Domestic Steering Committee. These data shall include demographics, product attributes, primary and secondary diagnoses, primary clinical outcomes, length of stay, clinical, laboratory, and radiological parameters (pre and post transfusion), and adverse events such as transfusion-associated events, re-operation, myocardial infarction, etc. The data shall be extracted from medical records and entered routinely by the CCC in a web-based data entry system to be provided by the DCC. Use of electronic medical record data capture systems is strongly encouraged, whenever available. This information shall be considered a deliverable to the DCC. <br />The hub CCC shall provide a unique study identification number for each patient that shall allow tracking of all information related to the patient when admitted to participating hospitals or seen at participating outpatient clinics. The hospitals shall maintain the link between the unique study patient ID and the medical record patient identifier to allow the hospital to contact the patient for appropriate follow-up. The link between patient identification number and patient name or other identifier shall be kept in a secured location by the research staff at the participating hospital.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Collect and enter donor (donations/components) and/or patient data for a particular REDS-III study protocol. Data elements to be collected shall be protocol-specific and specified in the corresponding Manual of Operation. These data may be prospectively or retrospectively collected as delineated in the protocol. Data shall be entered by the CCC in a data management system provided by the DCC as specified in the protocol, and transmitted to the DCC. This information shall be considered a deliverable to the DCC.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Implement procedures to maintain data security and confidentiality.</p>

<DESC><br />This is a Research and Development (R &amp; D) Sources Sought notice. This is <strong>NOT</strong> a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement.
<p><br /><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is seeking three (3) International Sites (one each in Brazil, China, and South Africa) for an ongoing program - the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study III (REDS-III). The objective of REDS-III is to assure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S., affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S., but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. The REDS-III program is comprised of one Central Laboratory, one Data Coordinating Center, four Domestic Hubs, and three International collaborative sites in Brazil, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>REDS-III contractors are currently completing Phase 2 of the contract, conducting several study protocols and compiling donor, recipient, and linked databases, and performing laboratory testing. The NHLBI anticipates that the three International collaborative sites in Brazil, China, and South Africa will be needed until March 14, 2020 to complete the development, review and approval of analyses, presentations and publications based on the research conducted in Phase 2, as well as closure of databases.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
<p>During the period from September 15, 2017 - March 14, 2020, each of the three International Sites (one each in Brazil, China, and South Africa) is expected to provide the necessary technical expertise and facilities to effectively perform the tasks and meet the requirements identified below:</p>
<p>1. The U.S. blood center shall manage the REDS-III international site's scope of work and study protocols and ensure transmission of complete and accurate scientific data from the foreign blood collection sites (subcontracts) to the REDS-III Data Coordinating Center (DCC), in accordance with procedures set forth in the protocols and Manuals of Procedures.</p>
<p>2. The U.S. blood center shall manage, through foreign subcontracts, the collection of a minimum of 250,000 blood donations annually from at least three collaborating and geographically dispersed foreign collection sites located in a low or middle income country affected by the AIDS epidemic. Each foreign blood collection site must collect a minimum of 25,000 donations annually.</p>
<p>3. The U.S. blood center Principal Investigator shall serve as a member of the REDS-III Oversight Committee.<br />As a member of the Oversight Committee, actively participate in the review and approval of the REDS-III Domestic and International study portfolios as well as evaluate program progress to ensure that the overall objectives of the REDS-III program are being met.</p>

The CCC shall be responsible for obtaining and transmitting donor/donation and all study-specific data to the DCC. All foreign collections sites shall capture the same donor/donation data elements as defined by the International Steering Committee and described in the donor/donation database Manuals of Operations. The CCC shall also conduct quality-checks on the data. The CCC shall be responsible for collecting all foreign collection sites donor/donation data and study-specific data, transmitting the data to the DCC, and providing the necessary IT and data management expertise to: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Prepare and provide data to the REDS-III DCC on all donors and donations collected by the participating foreign sites. These data shall be compiled in a cumulative donor/donation central database by the DCC. The foreign collection centers shall collect, prepare and provide data on a total of at least 250,000 donations annually with corresponding donor information. The donor/donation data will be compiled for a period of approximately 5 years (60 months). Demographic information on blood donors shall include date of birth, gender, race/ethnicity, level of education, country of birth, history of transfusion and geographical area of residence. Information on blood donor status (first-time versus repeat), donation type (e.g., community whole blood), donation date, and donation site shall be collected and provided to the REDS-III DCC. Screening and confirmatory test data shall include detailed results of all individual tests being performed and final screening and confirmatory test interpretations. The donation screening and confirmatory test data shall be transmitted to the REDS-III DCC with minimal delay from time of donation to receipt of confirmatory test results. This information shall be considered a deliverable to the DCC;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.

<DESC>TITLE: Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) for the Wideband Training and Certification System (WTCS).  <br>  <br> Contract Vehicle: TBD  <br>  <br> Brief Summary: This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is being issued as a follow-on to the WTCS Request for Information (RFI) dated 15 May 2014. Since the posting of the RFI, the Government has generated the technical documentation of this requirement and is hereby providing Industry with an opportunity to respond to this technical information.  The WTCS technical documentation includes the following: <br>  <br> - Draft Statement of Work (SOW)  <br> - Draft System Specification <br>  <br> Market research is being conducted to determine interested sources and capabilities of contractors for the procurement of the WTCS.  Interested sources are invited to provide a capability statement to deliver the WTCS capability as described in the attached technical documentation. <br>  <br> BRIEF DESCRIPTION:  <br> The WTCS shall be an interactive training system to train military and/or civilian operators on the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and its associated subsystems to support the Army's Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) 25S, the Satellite Systems Network Coordinator Course Additional Skill Identifier (ASI) 1C training course located at the USACCoE, Ft. Gordon, GA.  The WTCS will also be installed at the Wideband Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Communications Operation Centers (WSOCs) to be used for sustainment training and operator certification. <br>  <br> The WTCS may be based on an approach that involves a combination of software virtualization, application simulations, and/or other best commercial practice training delivery approaches to support WSOMS task training, evaluation, and certification activities. <br>  <br> The objectives of the WTCS program are:  <br> a. Develop a training system to provide support to the initial training of the Satellite Systems/Network Coordinator Course, ASI 1C by providing interactive training capabilities that simulate real-world operational situations and provide the look and feel of the following subsystems:  <br>  <br> 1)	Common Network Planning Subsystem (CNPS)  <br> 2)	DSCS Integrated Management System (DIMS) <br> 3)	Frequency Conversion Subsystem (FCS) <br> 4)	Global Satellite Configuration Control Element (GSCCE) (with the training simulation limited to the ground managers tasks) <br> 5)	Global Terrestrial Critical Control Circuit System (GTC3S) <br> 6)	Joint Management Operations Subsystem (JMOS) <br> 7)	Remote Monitoring and Control Equipment (RMCE) <br> 8)	Replacement Frequency Modulated Order Wire (RFMOW) <br> 9)	Replacement Patch and Test Facility (RPTF) <br> 10)	Replacement Radio Frequency Interconnecting Subsystem (RRFIS) <br> 11)	Wideband Remote Monitoring Sensor (WRMS) <br> 12)	Replacement Satellite Configuration Control Element (RSCCE <br> b. Develop a system to simulate the functional capabilities of WSOMS systems and subsystems and be fully interactive; have a high availability, low-failure, low-maintenance capability; be locally controllable and maintainable; and be fully-supportable and upgradeable. <br> c. Provide training modules with simulated capabilities of the WSOMS systems and subsystems between control systems and tools that emulate traffic flow, interfaces, and operations. <br> d. Ensure the delivered WTCS meets Government defined performance requirements; Risk Management Framework (RMF) and Information Assurance (IA) requirements; Test requirements; and Integrated Logistics requirements. <br> e. Provide for a Trainer Management System (TMS) designed to manage WTCS training content and individual, crew, and unit performance records; support the scheduling of WTCS training resources and activities; and support all trainer administrative functions to include controlling and managing access and WTCS privilege levels. <br> f. Provide sustainment training in support of the training and evaluation requirements for WSOC facilities by providing training and evaluation capabilities that allow users to receive real-time experience without any risks; tracks user progress; offers a way to learn at a user's own pace; and creates engaging and interactive training scenarios and programs of instruction. <br> g. Provide the ability for organizational leadership to evaluate individual and crew readiness on non-routine tasks without affecting current operations. <br> h. Provide standardized and automated evaluation of organizational training activities, execution of operator training tasks, and evaluation of training. <br> i. Provide an avenue for knowledgeable operators to request adjustments to training tasks in order to maintain consistency with changing Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). <br>  <br> The WTCS may leverage specific modules of excellence from DOCS Training System (DTS) that pertain to WGS and other delivered simulation system capabilities into an interactive training system that meets institutional training requirements IAW Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) standards, USACCoE and WSOC operator training requirements for U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/U.S. Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT), 1st Space Brigade, and the 53rd Signal Battalion.  <br>  <br> The WTCS shall consist of standalone workstations as well as workstations networked between instructors and students in a controlled classroom environment.  <br> The WTCS shall include a free-play, self-paced training application to support USACCoE controller training and evaluation.  It shall be installed on and deliver training to USACCoE 25S 1C classroom computers.  It shall minimize, mitigate, and/or eliminate any impacts on and risks to day-to-day, current operations and operational systems involved with the classroom computers to which they are deployed.  Its design and interfaces shall not compromise the system integrity, reliability, availability, releasability, and security classification of the operational environments associated with the classroom computers on which the application is installed. <br> The WTCS shall improve operational support for the growing Wideband SATCOM, Space Situational Awareness and Defensive Space Control Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) resolution mission. <br>  <br> The Contractor will develop and support software using non-proprietary components.  All software is to be developed and modified to provide Government Purpose Rights.  Any contractor presenting a proposal using proprietary components/software will not be considered for this effort.  The software build environment must be self contained, not dependent on any capital assets. <br>  <br> The information above does not preclude the use of Commercial of the Shelf (COTS) software in particular solutions.  However, the intent behind requiring GPR is to allow the Government to pursue future upgrades/modifications and Life Cycle Support in a competitive environment.  Excessive use of COTS that contain restrictive rights or recurring licensing agreements does not support this intent and may be considered a weakness in contractor approaches should this effort progress to Request for Proposals. <br>  <br> INTENT OF THIS SSN: <br>  <br> To collect responses from offerors interested in providing a simulation capability for the WTCS. Capability statements will not be utilized for any purpose other than for market research.  Only experienced/qualified suppliers should respond.

2.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK: 
Provide the necessary labor, material, equipment and qualified supervision to design and construct a fully functional Photovoltaic Solar System for the VA Medical Center Biloxi located at 400 Veterans Ave, Biloxi, MS 39531. The scope of work shall include the following sites listed below:

"	Site 1: Surface parking lot Carport PV (see site plan). The intent for Site 1 is to have carport structures built at the locations shown in the site plan. The carports are to be double cantilevered steel frame structures and have a metal standing seam roof. The solar module arrays will attach to the metal standing seams using a conventional rail system. The steel frame is to be painted white and the standing seam roof is to be red so as to match the color of the covered canopies recently constructed at the Biloxi VAMC. The minimum output should be at least 200 kW DC

The electric power generated by this Solar PV system may be supplied to the closest switchgear with available capacity that connects to the Facility distribution system. The surface parking lot adjacent to the parking garage is constructed of asphalt pavement and concrete traffic islands to control traffic movement and to contain landscaping. The parking lot has 2-lane traffic between parking bays that are all striped perpendicular to the traffic lanes. The parking lot has trees along the perimeter and in several of the traffic islands. The trees located in the traffic islands adjacent to the proposed canopies are to be removed and hauled off site. Tree stumps and roots are to be grinded to a minimum of 6 inches below existing grade.

"	Site 2: Building 28 parking garage top deck area. The intent for site 2 is for a post and beam long span structure that provides an area of covered parking on the top deck of the parking garage structure. The structure must withstand wind loads of 140 miles per hour. The steel canopy structure will be provided with a marine-grade finish and engineered for the local wind. The parking garage is constructed of post-tension slabs attached to columns. The panels are to be tilted to ensure the modules will be self-cleaned during The minimum output should be at least 150 kW DC

"	Site 3: Building 25 electric scooter charging station and covered parking. The intent for site 3 is a steel framed structure to be constructed that covers the 7 spaces at the existing electric scooter charging station area located at Building 25 (see site plan). A solar module array will connect to the facilities distribution grid. The steel structured canopy is to be anchored into the concrete footings that already exist at this location. The steel framed structure is to be painted white and is to have a red painted metal standing seam roof that matches the covered walkways recently constructed at the Biloxi VAMC. The minimum output should be at least 1 kW DC

"	Site 4: Building 14 roof top PV. The intent for site 4 is to construct a solar PV system that connects to the metal seams of the existing roof of building 14. It is proposed to locate the inverters and combiners in the conditioned attic space of Building 14 and to tie the power generated by the PV system into the facility distribution system at the nearest transformer.  The minimum output should be at least 28  kW DC

Work includes but is not limited to the equipment and material selection, all structural elements, concrete placement, grounding/ bonding, lightning protection, DC / AC electrical distribution, Lighting under carport canopies, grading, trenching and asphalt replacement and installation of a complete Photovoltaic solar system.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Branch, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of the Elekta Leksell Stereostatic System. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 339113 - Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing. Business size standard is for NAICS 339113 is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Elekta, Inc., 400 Perimeter Center Ter NE, Atlanta, GA, 30346-1227. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 3:00 pm Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Tuesday, 30 Dec 14. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The part numbers, descriptions, and quantities required are as follows:<br />-1008174, MPS ARC W/ COUNTER SCALE KIT, QTY 1<br />-A1200-04, LSS CLAMP, QTY 1<br />-914798, CROSS HAIR TARGET, STAINLESS, QTY 1<br />-916282, OPEN CT INDICATOR, QTY 1<br />-A0400-04, CT-ADAPTER, ADJUSTABLE, QTY 1<br />-A0401-14, CT-TABLE FIX, "UNIVERSAL", QTY 1<br />-1006463, FRAME G KIT WITH INSULATED POS, QTY 1<br />-A0820-07, MR-INDICATOR FOR FRAME MODEL G, QTY 1<br />-A0420-XX, MR-ADAPTER, SCANNER UNKNOWN, QTY 1</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Leksell is the only frame available to facilitate all intracranial sterotactic neurosurgery procedures including deep brain stimulation. The neuro spine surgeons are trained to use this system and using another product would require him or her to do a year of training which includes both in-class, hands on training and trials before he or she can use the product to operate on a patient. If these items are not used, the patients will have to be treated off base at a substantial duplication of cost of approximately $105,000.00.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to Laura.Caravantes@us.af.mil no later than 3:00 pm Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Tuesday, 30 Dec 14. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered.</p>

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).<br /><br />This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 813920: Professional Organizations. Business size standard for NAICS 813920 is $15,000,000.00. <br /><br />The proposed source is American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), 3141 Fairview Park Dr Ste 777, Falls Church, VA, 22042. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by Monday, 5 Jan 2015, 1000 EST. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br /><br />In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires AIHA to provide Industrial Hygiene accreditation and Environmental Lead accreditation because AIHA is the only known source that provides the required accreditations. The government requires on-site analytical testing and reaccreditation of the OEHTA laboratory at DET 3 UASAFSAM, Okinawa Japan. Laboratories performing industrial hygiene sample analysis are required by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be accredited by an appropriate accreditation body certified by EPA. The testing includes the following: <br /><br />1. Industrial Hygiene Annual Fee to provide accreditation to the OEHTA laboratory.<br />2. Environmental Lead Annual Fee to provide accreditation to the OEHTA laboratory.<br />3. Environmental Lead Proficiency Analytical Testing (ELPAT) to include Paint Samples, Soil Samples, and Dust Samples.<br />4. Industrial Hygiene Proficiency Analytical Testing (IHPAT) to include Metals Samples, Organic Samples, and Diffusive 3M Samplers.
<p>Biennial Accreditation:<br />6. ELLAPANN - Accreditation Program, Environmental Lead<br />7. IHLAPANN - Accreditation Program, Industrial Hygiene</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov. <br /><br />Any information should be e-mailed to mikinee.moses@us.af.mil no later than Monday, 5&nbsp;Jan 2015, 1000 EST. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered. <br /><br />Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "American Industrial Hygiene Association Certification - Okinawa Japan". Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with e-mail ensure only .PDF, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Life Technologies, 3175 Staley Road, Grand Island, NY 14072. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p><br />This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing; the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to award a non-competitive, sole source contract to Life Technologies, 3175 Staley Road, Grand Island, NY 14072 for a newly developed CPA 200 Punch instrument. Services are being procured under FAR 13.5, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>The FBI is responsible for processing known reference samples of Convicted Offenders, Arrestees and Detainees. The Federal DNA Database Unit became operational in December 2000 as the Federal Convicted Offender Program and collects and analyzes DNA samples submitted from around the country as required by the DNA Backlog Elimination Act of 2000, the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the DNA Fingerprint Act of 2005 and the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, broadened the scope of sample collections from just convicted federal offenders to include federal arrestees, as well as non-U.S. citizen detainees. Under those acts, federal agencies, to include the FBI, are directed by the USAG to collect DNA samples from individuals who are arrested, facing charges, convicted, or from non-United States persons who are detained under the authority of the United States. In order to comply with this legislation the FBI has a need to explore the use of the newly developed CPA 200 Punch instrument. The current punch instrument used by the FBI is no longer in production. The FBI needs to purchase the CPA 200 Punch Instrument in order to perform validations and evaluate how the new punch instrument handles high quantities of samples and the daily working conditions found at the FBI Laboratory.</p>
<p>The FBI has validated the Identifier Direct kit using the manufacturer's recommendation of a 1.2mm punch size. The CPA 200 is the only standalone punch instrument that has the required 1.2mm punch head. This instrument will be used in accordance with the FBI's protocols in compliance with the standards of the American Society of Crime Lab Directors/Laboratory Accreditation Board (ASCLD/LAB). Life Technologies is the only manufacturer and sole provider of the CPA 200.</p>
<p>Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement can only be provided by Life Technologies as no other vendor is capable of providing the required CPA 200 Punch instrument.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to this office by 08:00 am, EST, January 05, 2015, by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.</p>

<CONTACT>Henry T. Wells

<a href="mailto:Henry.Wells@va.gov">henry.wells@va.gov</a>
<DESC>This is a request for Information:
SUBJECT:  Request for Information (RFI), Synopsis for Endoscope Flushing Aids for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information on the capability of vendors to provide Endoscope Flushing Aids for the Veterans Health Administration. This RFI allows potential contractor to submit a non-binding statement of interest and documentation demonstrating their capabilities, and suggestions that will allow the Government to refine its potential course of action. The RFI effort is intended to assess industry service capabilities and solicit feedback for acquisition planning purposes. The Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC) is requesting response from qualified business concerns. The NAICS code for this effort is 339112, Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing; the PSC is 6515.    
BACKGROUND:      VHA is comprised of 152 medical centers responsible for providing high quality and timely commodities and services for our veterans and their families. These medical facilities are located throughout the United States.  The VHA National Standardization Program identified Endoscope Flushing Aids as a candidate for standardization.  These flushing aids are devices used by VA clinicians to remove a patient's biomaterial and microorganisms from the endoscope.  Following any surgical procedure, biomaterial from a patient is present on the insertion tube and within the internal channels of the endoscope.  All channels must be cleaned, even if unused, due to fluid and debris entering these channels at the distal tip. Endoscope Flushing Aids reduce the risk of repetitive motion injuries by providing continuous, hands-free channel flushing.  With a simple one-touch operation, Endoscope Flushers quickly and quietly delivers detergent or rinse solutions to endoscope channels, and can even flush the elevator wire channel.
As budgets become more constrained, enterprise acquisition solutions provide the capability to enhance and streamline acquisition processes to make them more efficient and provide an overall cost savings to the government.  Thereby, the government's intent is to continue to leverage quantity buys across the VA via a VHA enterprise-wide contract vehicle for Endoscope Flushing Aids.
SCOPE:  The Contractor shall provide an uninterrupted source of supply for all contracted Endoscope Flushing Aids for the entire duration of resulting agreement period.  The contractor shall provide quality items that meet the minimum technical requirements (MTRs) and delivery terms and conditions of the BPA.  The Contractor's performance will be measured by the quality of the items provided based on the minimum technical requirements, delivery items and conditions of the BPA.
The following are the Minimal Technical Requirements for product requested:
  MTR
Number	Minimum Technical Requirement (MTR)
MTR1	Unit Weight
MTR2	Electrical Power Requirements
MTR3	Electrical Safety Certifications             (UL Standard 61010-1)

MTR4	Compatibility with all VHA Endoscopes
MTR5	Scope Capacity

MTR6	Fluid Delivery Rate
MTR7	Flush Time  
MTR8	Timer Control
MTR9	System Pressure
MTR10	Cycle Completion Indicators  
MTR11	Unit Placement  
MTR12	Footswitch  
MTR13	Compliance with  the provisions/specifications as outlined in ASTM, 2000b
MTR14	Compliance with  the provisions/specifications as outlined in ISO 15883
MTR15	Compliance with  the provisions and specifications as outlined in ISO 13485
MTR16	Compliance with  the provisions and specifications as outlined in ISO 13849
MTR17	Compliance with  the provisions and specifications as outlined in ISO 17664

Physical understanding of the dependence of seismic source generation on explosion emplacement conditions (depth, scaled depth, decoupling, material properties, pre-stress, and local structure) is of particular interest, especially for small seismic events. Hypothesis tests of proposed mechanisms for anomalous waveform characteristics, e.g. larger surface waves than predicted for explosions, are of interest. Investigations intended to distinguish between feasible source mechanisms are strongly preferred over efforts to assess the feasibility of a single mechanism. Methods of determining depth to within 10s of meters for shallow events are of particular interest. Partitioning of energy into P, S, and surface waves, and understanding of the higher frequencies that may be critical for local discrimination are of interest, as are methods that can discriminate chemical from nuclear explosions. Proposals may include one or multiple approaches, including analysis of existing nuclear and chemical explosion records, theoretical investigations, and/or numerical simulations.</span></p>

New understanding of the properties of small seismic events and their seismic waveforms at local (200 km or less) and regional (2,000 km or less) distances is of interest, as are extensions of existing regional discriminants to smaller, locally recorded events, and development of new discriminants that take advantage of the characteristics of small locally recorded events, with rigorous assessments of performance and uncertainty. Of particular interest are methods for estimating yield of seismic events recorded at local distances with low uncertainty. At regional distances, there is an interest in improved event characterization of smaller events as well as improved understanding of uncertainties. Methods to improve the accuracy of source characterization by moment tensors and their uncertainties, and new understanding of their limitations, are also of interest.</span></p>

Certification shall be IAW Clause 52.212-4 addendum (v)(3). Documentation must be submitted indicating that the Offeror is a local exchange carrier certified by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br />(5) If the remittance address is different from the mailing address, include all applicable remittance addresses.<br />(6) Written acknowledgement of all applicable solicitation amendments.<br />B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as "Not Separately Priced" by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as "No Charge" by entering "NC" in the unit price. <br />c. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS estimates. <br />(3) Provide a statement specifying that "all pricing in the proposal is Firm-Fixed, with the exception of TFS".</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Offerors are highly encouraged to complete all Representations and Certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/.

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offerors specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>As part of GSAs continuing effort to improve the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) program, the following requirements have been incorporated, effective the date of this refresh.

Full Products and Broad Services Offerings

Offeror must provide a full and broad offering on services and/or products. Offers will not be accepted with only limited item/offering (product, labor category, training course, or fixed-price service) unless it represents a total solution for the Special Item Numbers (SINs). 

Fair and Reasonable Pricing

To determine fair and reasonable pricing, the GSA Contracting Officer may consider many factors, including pricing on competitor contracts, historical pricing, and currently available pricing in other venues.  Offers which provide Most Favored Customer pricing, but which are not highly competitive will not be found fair and reasonable and will not be accepted.  

Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 3 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received.  However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.   

PLEASE NOTE:  ALL RESPONSES SHALL BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY AS EOFFERS

</a>
<DESC>Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 6 months before your offer is evaluated. 

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received.  However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.   

As part of GSA's continuing effort to improve the Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) program, the following requirements have been incorporated, effective the date of this refresh.

Full Products and Broad Services Offerings
Offeror must provide a full and broad offering on services and/or products. Offers will not be accepted with only limited item/offering (product, labor category, training course, or fixed-price service) unless it represents a total solution for the Special Item Numbers (SINs). 

Fair and Reasonable Pricing
To determine fair and reasonable pricing, the GSA Contracting Officer may consider many factors, including pricing on competitor contracts, historical pricing, and currently available pricing in other venues.  Offers which provide Most Favored Customer pricing, but which are not highly competitive will not be found fair and reasonable and will not be accepted.  

The General Services Administration (GSA) is issuing solicitation number 2FYA-AR-060004-B Refresh 25 for Multiple Award Schedule 738X for Human Resources & EEO Services, effective 12/30/14. 2FYA-AR-060004-B Refresh 25 replaces solicitation number 2FYA-AR-060004-B Refresh 24 in its entirety. 

Resultant contracts will be indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts under the GSA Multiple Award Schedule program. Current contract holders under Schedule 738X for Human Resources & EEO Services do not need to re-apply. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by this agency. Contracts under this solicitation will have a contract period beginning on the date of award, and lasting for five years unless canceled or terminated. Three five-year option periods are possible under this contractual action.

The purpose of this solicitation is to provide a vehicle for all Government agencies to obtain quality Human Resource Services and EEO Services when required from qualified and experienced Contractor(s) under a Multiple Award Federal Supply Schedule in an efficient, streamlined, and cost effective manner in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif; text-transform: uppercase;">Purpose:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) needs to acquire four 50 GHz wafer probes for use in the on-wafer test of differential microwave integrated circuits. The probes will be used with a vector network analyzer and wafer-probe station. The input must be a 2.4 mm connector.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">NIST also needs to acquire two 110 GHz wafer probes for use in testing single-ended millimeter-wave circuits. The probes will be used with a vector network analyzer and wafer-probe station. The input must be a 1.0 mm connector.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The NIST also needs to acquire two 140-220 GHz, two 220-325 GHz and two 750-1100 GHz microwave wafer probes for use in the on-wafer test of sub-millimeter-wave integrated circuits. The probes will be used with a vector network analyzer and wafer-probe station. The input must be a rectangular waveguide with a UG-387 compatible flange. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">The probes must be ground-signal-ground probes with a 50 um pitch, except for the 750-1100 GHz probes, which should be of approximately 25 um pitch to perform well at these frequencies. Because of the high frequencies to which the integrated circuits and transistors we will test must operate, we have minimized contact-pad sizes to 30 um wide by 40 um long to reduce contact-pad capacitance. Two different types of contact pads will be used. The first type of contact pads will be soft gold plated on a thin bisbenzocyclobutene-based (BCB) monomers film, and the probes must not damage the contact pads. The second will be gold-plated 30 um wide by 40 um long contact pads recessed in a 2 um thick insulating passivation layer.</span></p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation seeking Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes for commercial aircraft component repair or overhaul services prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) repair or overhaul cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government estimate of the repair or overhaul as applicable based on the government's historical pricing data. The purpose of this solicitation is to determine the best value to the government with regard to the repair/overhaul of an aircraft component(s). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and no other solicitation document will be issued. Request for Quotation (RFQ) number HSCG38-15-Q-010041 is assigned for tracking purposes only. Federal Acquisition Regulations 52.212-1, 52.212-2, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, and 52.212-5 apply. Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-79. Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) intends to award a purchase order to the OEM or a fully capable repair vendor. With exception of the Aircraft OEM or Component Production Approval Authority (PAH), a capable repair vendor must be deemed capable by USCG Aviation Logistics Center Medium Range Surveillance Division's Engineering Department (ALC MRS) and therefore must be a FAA Certified Repair Facility, and/or an OEM Approved Repair Facility, be in legal possession of all current OEM Data required to complete the repair, and be able to certify that final assembly and testing will be conducted at their facility. Vendors who do not meet the capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond.

The Coast Guard does not own nor can acquire or provide repair manuals or OEM repair data. In their quote, vendors must provide a reference to the current OEM Manual or Service Reference (i.e. "will be repaired IAW CMM 12345-6789") that will be used in the repair or overhaul as applicable.

DE ARAGON 404, MADRID, ESP E-28022, Cage Code 0117B, and their domestic repair facility Cage Code is 0DAF1. The component Production Approval Authority (PAH) is Hamilton Sundstrand, Cage Code 73030, and their applicable Repair Facility is Cage Code 0YJV4. Any TT&amp;E plus average repair cost quotes received will be weighed against Firm-Fixed-Price Quotes received by being evaluated based on best value to the government and a proposed average estimated repair cost plus a maximum economical repair cost. This is a SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. NAICS Code 488190 is applicable. This solicitation is for the repair of HC-144 Aircraft Component/Part(s):

      (1) VA's Electronic Invoice Presentment and Payment System. (See Web site at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp.)
      (2) Any system that conforms to the X12 electronic data interchange (EDI) formats established by the Accredited Standards Center (ASC) and chartered by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).

  (d) Invoice requirements. Invoices shall comply with FAR 32.905.
  (e) Exceptions. If, based on one of the circumstances below, the contracting officer directs that payment requests be made by mail, the contractor shall submit payment requests by mail through the United States Postal Service to the designated agency office. Submission of payment requests by mail may be required for:
      (1) Awards made to foreign vendors for work performed outside the United States;
      (2) Classified contracts or purchases when electronic submission and processing of payment requests could compromise the safeguarding of classified or privacy information;
      (3) Contracts awarded by contracting officers in the conduct of emergency operations, such as responses to national emergencies;
      (4) Solicitations or contracts in which the designated agency office is a VA entity other than the VA Financial Services Center in Austin, Texas; or

21.	52.204-16	Commercial and Government Entity Code Reporting (NOV 2014)
22.	52.204-17	Ownership or Control of Offeror
23.	52.209-5	Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)
(a)
(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that --
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals --
(A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
(B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and
(C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and
(D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(2) Examples.
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.
(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

(B) The payment of a reimbursement, restitution, or damages in excess of $100,000.
(iv) In a criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding, a disposition of the matter by consent or compromise with an acknowledgment of fault by the Contractor if the proceeding could have led to any of the outcomes specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), or (c)(1)(iii) of this provision.
(2) If the offeror has been involved in the last five years in any of the occurrences listed in (c)(1) of this provision, whether the offeror has provided the requested information with regard to each occurrence.
(d) The offeror shall post the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this provision in FAPIIS as required through maintaining an active registration in the System for Award Management database via https://www.acquisition.gov (see 52.204-7).

<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>As a member of the OTI Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) Team, the Program Performance Management (PPM) Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition, stabilization, and conflict mitigation programs, to provide support and guidance for country program staff to help ensure the successful implementation of OTI program activities in the field.</p>
<p>OTI's success now and in the future depends in large part on its ability to achieve an overarching organizational goal: the effective transfer and ongoing analysis of knowledge and experience - comprised of values, management processes, lessons learned, best practices, standards, and innovations - in real time, with a variety of stakeholders. These stakeholders include: OTI staff in the field and headquarters; OTI's implementing partners around the world; USAID Missions overseas; other USAID offices and bureaus in Washington; other U.S. Government agencies and branches; other donors; other transition, stabilization and reconstruction practitioners; host government and/or other local counterparts; and the U.S. public. All of the above increases OTI's level of transparency and accountability.<br /> <br />To this end, the OTI ABC Team supports a model of organizational learning across the office that ensures:</p>
<p>1.	Increased transparency and accountability between the headquarters and field teams;<br />2.	Increased opportunities for peer-to-peer dialogue;<br />3.	Easier access to content and learning resources for a variety of stakeholders;<br />4.	More guidance available in online format;<br />5.	Provision of tools to surface and apply OTI's programming lessons to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of OTI programs.</p>
<p>The PPM Specialist supports OTI's mission to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key political transition and stabilization needs by building the knowledge, skills and abilities of OTI staff to continually improve country program performance. The PPM Specialist does this by: designing and providing innovative solutions that are adapted to OTI's fast-paced global needs; developing and facilitating learning and training events; and providing support services ranging from procurement to linkages with private sector partners. ABC supports learning and innovation through the application of technology - including OTI's knowledge management platform, mapping, data visualization, and other analytic tools - to continually improve OTI country program analysis, management and performance. ABC will ensure the effective integration of lessons and knowledge into OTI's learning and training resources. ABC coordinates closely with other units, teams, and divisions within OTI to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Program Performance Management Specialist requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ? 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ? 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <BR> <BR>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). (The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).)

(s) Order of precedence. Any inconsistencies in this solicitation or contract shall be resolved by giving precedence in the following order: (1) The schedule of supplies/services; (2) The Assignments, Disputes, Payments, Invoice, Other Compliances, Compliance with Laws Unique to Government Contracts, and Unauthorized Obligations paragraphs of this clause; (3) The clause at 52.212-5; (4) Addenda to this solicitation or contract, including any license agreements for computer software; (5) Solicitation provisions if this is a solicitation; (6) Other paragraphs of this clause; (7) The Standard Form 1449; (8) Other documents, exhibits, and attachments; and (9) The specification. <BR> <BR>(t) System for Award Management (SAM) (1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). (2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). (3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Public Laws 108-77 and 108-78 (19 U.S.C. 3805 note)).

This does not require the Contractor to create or maintain any record that the Contractor does not maintain in the ordinary course of business or pursuant to a provision of law. (e)(1) Notwithstanding the requirements of the clauses in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this clause, the Contractor is not required to flow down any FAR clause, other than those in this paragraph (e)(1) of this paragraph in a subcontract for commercial items. Unless otherwise indicated below, the extent of the flow down shall be as required by the clause- (i) 52.203-13, Contractor Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (APR 2010) (41 U.S.C. 3509). <BR> <BR>The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by referenc -- Please refer to FedBid for complete list of contract requirement(s) and terms and conditions. <BR> <BR>

<p>a. Compliance with Drawing 8554696.<br />b. Compliance with the requirements in the SOW.<br />c. Compliance with delivery schedule as detailed in the SOW.</p>
<p>4. The offeror's technical proposal shall enable Government evaluating personnel to make a thorough evaluation and arrive at a sound determination as to whether or not the proposal will meet the requirements of the Statement of Work. Each technical proposal shall be specific, detailed, and complete as to clearly and fully demonstrate that the prospective contractor has a thorough knowledge and understanding of the Statement of Work requirements. Proposals that paraphrase the specifications / Statement of Work or attest that "standard procedures will be employed" are inadequate to demonstrate how the proposal complies with the Statement of Work and will render the proposal "Unacceptable".</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance</p>
<p>Offerors must not have unsatisfactory past performance. The Offeror shall not submit performance data for this factor. The government may seek relevant performance information on all responsive and otherwise Technically Acceptable Offerors through sources such as DCMA, CPARS, FAPIIS, or PPIRS; or other government databases and other available sources. The government shall not be limited in its search for performance data. When past performance is evaluated, the outcome is satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory. Unsatisfactory performance will disqualify an Offeror from award. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance, the Offeror shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance; however, the offeror would be rated neutral. Satisfactory and Neutral are determined to be passing.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price Evaluation<br />The government shall conduct a price evaluation of all technically acceptable offers with satisfactory or neutral past performance.</p>
<p>b. Rejection of Unrealistic Offers:<br />The Government may reject any quote that is evaluated to be unrealistic in terms of program commitments, including contract terms and conditions, or unrealistically high or low in price when compared to Government estimates, or are unbalanced, such that the quote is deemed to reflect an inherent lack of competence or failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the program.</p>
<p>c. Selection Decision:<br />The government shall select the lowest priced, technically acceptable, responsive, and responsible offer for award.</p>
<p>All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to FedBizOpps. It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor FedBizOpps for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation. For changes made after the closing date, only those Offerors that provide a quote will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.<br />To be eligible for award of a Government contract, contractors must be properly registered in the System for Award Management (SAM).

By submission of its offer, the Offeror accepts all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements.

Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.

For the purpose of award, the government shall evaluate offers based on the evaluation factors described below:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - Technical Acceptability (Pass/Fail)<br />FACTOR 2 - Past Performance (Pass/Fail)<br />FACTOR 3 - Price</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical Acceptability<br />In order to be determined technically acceptable, the offer must clearly demonstrate capability to meet the following standards:</p>
<p>1. The offeror shall submit their Technical Capability Information as Volume I, and be no more than 3 pages.</p>

The government shall not be limited in its search for performance data. When past performance is evaluated, the outcome is satisfactory, neutral, or unsatisfactory. Unsatisfactory performance will disqualify an Offeror from award. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance, the Offeror shall not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance; however, the offeror would be rated neutral. Satisfactory and Neutral are determined to be passing.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Price Evaluation<br />The government shall conduct a price evaluation of all technically acceptable offers with satisfactory or neutral past performance.</p>
<p>b.

<p>All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to FedBizOpps.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopter Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation for the following parts:</p>

<p>All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopter France (Cage Code F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted. <br />Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.</p>
<p>Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>TITLE: Assured Cyber Architectures (ACA)</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA-RIK-14-03</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800 &amp; 12.910</p>
<p><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The technical objectives of this BAA are to research innovative, disruptive technologies and methods to enable the Assured Cyber Architectures (ACA) vision in support of the Defense Intelligence Information Enterprise (DI2E). The ACA BAA seeks significant advances to the DI2E mission across the following sub-disciplines.<br /><br />The sub-disciplines of interest to this solicitation include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Infrastructure Service Technologies - Critical information assurance components for infrastructures and the ability to address a range of security issues to include (but not limited to): Identity Management, Access Management, Credential Management, Authentication Management, Cryptography Management, Security Metadata Management, Digital Policy Management, and System and Communication Protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Content Service Technologies - Ability to coordinate, optimize, and execute orchestration of services across information infrastructures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Application Service Technologies - In a Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) environment there will be common services used as to not replicate duplicative code across services. These include everything from semantic search capabilities to data analytics and mediation services, content management, and verifying quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Enterprise Evaluation - Ability to evaluate components for inclusion in integrated prototype architectures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Mission Service Technologies - The final layer in a SOA environment are the actual tools to be utilized, which are primarily analytical and processing tools specific for the intelligence community.</p>
<p>The innovative ACA technologies supporting the sub-disciplines above may require the planning and conducting of field tests to demonstrate the advancement in the specific technology. This includes preparing test plans; acquiring, transporting, deploying, and operating all equipment; operating and measuring ground truth sources; evaluating and monitoring test execution; and documenting all test results.</p>
<p>The ACA BAA will investigate assured computing architectures and associated technologies that will ultimately be incorporated within the Defense Information &amp; Intelligence Enterprise (DI2E). The goal of interfacing with the DI2E is twofold; first, provide a more cohesive and complete situational awareness and assessment of enemy activities for on-going US missions, and second, provide surgical cueing for ACA opportunities. Automated knowledge-based tools and decision aids will provide a more effective use of the DI2E with its complementary intelligence data for improved Situational Awareness. The development of infrastructures, tools and techniques that equip the operational analyst in providing timely and highly accurate characterization of signals, objects and events leading to threat analysis is increasingly critical to the warfighter.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately $49.9M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 14 - $10.3M; FY 15 - $9.6M; FY 16 - $10M; FY 17 - $10M; and FY18 - $10M. Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts normally ranging between $500K and $3M per year. There is also the potential to make awards above or below this range. Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements, depending upon the nature of the work proposed.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to select all, part, or none of the proposals received, subject to the availability of funds. All potential offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.</p>

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates the detailed approach, development, and testing of the proposed new technology to achieve relevant new capabilities or enhancements, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Confidential, SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. The offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation.

You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal.</p>
<p>3. Data Rights: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.</p>
<p>4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process.</p>

<p><br />NAICS CODE: 541712</p>
<p><br />FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>TITLE: ELINT COLLECTION, PROCESSING, AND EXPLOITATION <br />ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial Announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA- RIK-14-04</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p><br />I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The overall technical objectives of this BAA are to employ existing and emerging technologies to develop and demonstrate automated, real-time signal detection, processing, exploitation, and reporting capabilities of existing and emerging Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) signals in support of ground and airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms. Technology applications include, but are not limited to: (1) the enhancement of ELINT signal processing software and hardware to address the increased complexity and volume of the ELINT battlespace; (2) the enhancement of collection system efficiency for single and multi-platform collection optimization and management; (3) the development of technology for the detection and exploitation of emerging ELINT signals and systems; and (4) the enhancement of effectiveness of databases that use existing multi-source, multi-platform, real-time collection systems.</p>
<p>Detailed scope and definition of problems are as follows: (1) ELINT emitter detection, identification, geolocation, and tracking: Battlefield management depends heavily on ELINT assets to provide current threat analysis and assessment for successful war-fighting planning and resource management; a need for real-time detection, identification, geolocation, tracking, and reporting is required to prosecute existing and emerging ELINT systems that employ short-up-time tactics in Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) regions; (2) Automated signal collection, identification and first level processing: emerging ELINT systems employ advanced modulation, Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) signals that dictate the need for automated, dynamic collection using both on-board/off-board assets; (3) Enhanced digital ELINT processing: Environment complexity, as well as advanced collection hardware technology, demands growth in the digital ELINT processing arena; (4) Multi-sensor/multi-processor collection management: Networked SIGINT sensors extend the sensor virtual collection space, thus significantly enhancing the potential to collect emerging signals. Therefore, network centric collection management should be investigated to include, but not be limited, to multi-platform signal correlation and multi-INT sensor cueing. Attention should be paid to fusing the sensor measurements and network data bandwidth to support collection management. Deliverables will include technical reports and when appropriate, demonstrations, software and hardware.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately $49.9M.

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Added 30-Dec-2014</span></strong>
<p><em><strong>Solicitation has been extended to close on 23-Jan-15 at 1500 CST. </strong></em></p>
<p>Additional Site Visit will be held at Tinker AFB, Bldg 2280 on 9-Jan-15 from 1430-1530 CST. Those wishing to attend will need to send the list of attendees to darrell.hafer@us.af.mil NLT 1500 7-Jan-15.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions/Answers from Initial Site Visit:</span></strong></p>
<p>1. Is it the government's intent for the work to be completed in full and accepted prior to any payment on this contract? What is the intended use of our proprietary AutoCad drawings?</p>
<p>A) Yes, it is the government's intent for the work to be completed in full and accepted prior to the contractor receiving payment. The AutoCAD drawings shall allow the government to modify the AWP as required to meet the mission. Federal Codes, regulations, and policy's may change which require the AWP to be modified in order to comply...i.e. Safety, Fall Protection, outdated electrical systems, etc.</p>
<p>2. How much notice will field crews be given prior to re mobilizing after a delay in scheduling? What is the time frame we should utilize for delays during the installation schedule?</p>
<p>A) The contractor will be provided a notice within 72 hours after a delay in scheduling for re-mobilizing. The aircraft schedule is fluid and delays shall be expected in order to accomplish the government's mission. Delays could vary up to a month.</p>
<p>3. Is it the intent of the government for installation crews to remain on standby during the installation phase in order to accommodate government schedule and 24 hour work schedule?</p>
<p>A) The government expects the contractor to be available during the installation phase of the system. The government expects the contractor to use the timeframes allotted to accomplish the task.</p>
<p>4. 1.2.1 - Is the intent to conform with the original design loads indicated in the SOW (Appendix B) or was it the government's intention to have the existing building structure and its components surveyed and a full building analysis done as part of this contract? Is it the governments intent to indicate a contingency value for additional structure should it be required based on the survey and analysis?</p>
<p>A) The contractor is expected to field verify through structural analysis if their proposed design could be safely installed within the facility. Any additional structure required based on the contractors design will be the responsibility of the contractor. This is a full turn-key project.</p>
<p>5. 1.3.3 - Is it the intent of the government to have all utilities including those not impacted by the contract (those in the floor) surveyed and documented?</p>
<p>A) The utilities that are impacted by the installation of the new system shall be surveyed and documented.</p>
<p>6. 1.3.4 - Is the government indicating that all of the existing utilities and equipment are adequate to extend and service the new AWP's or is additional or new equipment required? Is it the intent of this contract for the entire hangar (floor to ceiling) to be rated as Class 1, Div. 1, group D?</p>
<p>A) The government does not indicate that all existing utilities and equipment are adequate to extend and service the contractors design. The contractor may require additional utilities and equipment to accommodate their design. It is the contractor's responsibility to make their system complete and usable within the facility. It is the intent that the equipment installed for the AWP shall be rated Class I, Division I, Group D.</p>
<p>7. 1.3.4g - As OSHA/ANSI does not endorse or approve specific systems; therefore, is the assembly of rated components acceptable if reviewed by an Oklahoma licensed engineer?</p>
<p>A) A Professional Engineer shall design, stamp and approve the fall protection system design. The design shall comply with OSHA/ANSI regulations. The design will be reviewed by local Tinker Safety offices to ensure that it also meets local Safety requirements.</p>
<p>8. 1.3.4n - We are not aware of a product that can be dropped 75' without damage. Can the government indicate what it had in mind for this requirement?</p>
<p>A) The intent is to ensure that the remote control systems that are used will not be easily damaged if they were to fall from the AWP onto the floor.</p>
<p>9. 1.3.4q - Can the government please provide the required distance between AWP's it is looking for under this requirement?</p>
<p>A) The AWP shall be able to allow the personnel to work on the forward and trailing edge of the same aircraft wings. The distance shall be 20 feet apart.</p>
<p>10. 1.3.4r - Is it the governments intent for this requirement to apply to the tail section platform also? The existing tail platform is not utilized, why? How can we avoid making the same mistakes?</p>
<p>A) Yes. The existing tail platform requires the aircraft to be re-positioned to access the tail section of the aircraft. The contractor shall design a system that will allow the tail platform to access the tail of the aircraft. The tail platform shall operate on a remote control unit that can lower the platform to the floor for access. Oftentimes, personnel must walk across the ceiling to access the tail platform when the remote control operations are not functioning properly.</p>
<p>11. In the South bay dock it was determined that the AWP's were coated with lead based paint generating disposal issues. Are there any other know hazardous materials in the North Dock or Is it the contractor's responsibility to determine if any additional hazardous materials exist.</p>
<p>A) It should be assumed that the lead paint used on the South Dock AWP would be the same in the North Dock. The use of strontium chromate primers during aircraft painting operations is also hazardous. These platforms have been installed within the facility since 1979, there could potentially be other hazardous materials used during this timeframe that the equipment has been exposed to and the equipment shall be considered hazardous as identified in 1.3.2.3.</p>
<p>12. In the south bay the fuselage fall protection equipment was supported by the runway beams specified to be removed. Is it the intent of this contract to replace all of the fall protection in the North dock, including those over the wings? If so are those runways beams to be removed also?</p>
<p>A) As indicated in 1.3.2.2 and 1.3.4g., Any existing fall protection systems located within the facility that are damaged, or required to be removed, determined to be unusable, during the demolition/installation of the contractors design for the AWP, shall be the contractors responsibility for replacement of the fall protection systems in accordance with current OSHA fall protection requirements and provide the proper certifications to the Government.</p>

Due to delay in posting of the questions proposals are now due 01/02/2015 by 4:00(PST).

Questions were as follows:

1.) Will offers be accepted electronically?

Answer: Yes.  If submitting electronically please send to Heather.Wagner@faa.gov.

2.) Is this project tax exempt?

Answer: . As a federal government entity we are not able to pay taxes and are exempt. However several states vary in their definition of exempt tax where supplies for construction are concerned. This is specific to the phase in which supplies are implemented and whether the supply has been modified as a part of the end product or remains unchanged as a direct pass through to the end client. Per Section B : The offered price shall encompass all costs related to (a) direct and indirect labor, fringe benefits, overhead, G&A expenses, profit, material, equipment, other direct costs, insurance, freight, handling, transportation, inspection, testing, operation and maintenance manuals, bonds, etc., (b) federal, state, and local taxes, (c) all applicable fees permits, licenses, and (d) any miscellaneous charges. As prospective contractor you will be responsible to know the practice of the state and county where work will be done. 

It is important to note that you may be in direct competition with contractors who have experience doing projects near this location.  I recommend contacting the state and county tax office to clarify what to expect in costs as related to your proposal.  In short as a federal agency we cannot and will not pay a direct tax cost but if you as a contractor are charged taxes for parts in the process then you would include this as a material cost.  We cannot advise on this matter, suggest how you determine your project costs or calculate local taxes.

Both amendments are now posted.  Tax Exempt form is also attached.

We cannot advise on this matter, suggest how you determine your project costs or calculate local taxes.     

3.) I understand that there are many piles of earth that have been dumped in the path way of the new underground wiring from the existing SWS F429 tower to the location of the new tower. Will the installing contractor have to move all these piles of earth before putting the trench through there for the extension of the wiring from the old location to the new location OR will someone else be responsible for this work?
 
Answer: The pile of dirt will not be removed.  The new site will be at the edge of the pile of dirt.

4.) I also understand that the area in which this new SWS is to be installed is possibly in the edge of a Superfund Clean Up Site. What effect will this have overall costs due to hazards that may exist?   

Answer:  The new site is not inside the Superfund boundary.  No hazard is required.

5.) Drawing GYR-D-SWS-E001 refers to some Phase II work in the removal of the existing  F420 Surface Weather System (SWS).
 
   A.) What exactly is included in the Phase I work?
 
   B.) What exactly is included in the Phase II Work?
  
Answer: .  A.)Phase I is all the concrete, trenching, and power installation.

           B.)Phase II is all electronic installation and removing existing F-420 which will be one by FAA.

6.) From drawing GYR-D-SWS-A001, a Point OF Beginning (P.O.B.) is referred to.
 
I take it that a Licensed Land Surveyor in the State of Arizona will need to be hired to locate the P.O.B. from drawing GYR-D-SWS-A001 and GYR-D-SWS-C001 for the lease of property by the FAA for the new SWS  at the Goodyear airport. Is this correct because neither the drawings or specifications talk about it from what reading I have done of both? Also the shutting down of the runway will need to be done while this work is being done?
 
Answer: No legal description  is required.  Drawing GYR-D-SWS-A001 is for information purpose.  It is used between Airport Authority and FAA only.  Contractor is not required to do any work on sheet A1.
 
7.) From drawing GYR-D-SWS-E002 a new Parkway Box is referred to. What is a Parkway Box, because even Hoffman Enclosures people that I have talked with have never heard the term?

Answer: Parkway Box is a aircraft rated pull box.  The contractor can submit other equal box that is aircraft rated.

8.) From the Specifications, page no. 6, 1-1.8 GOVERNMENT/CONTRACTOR FURNISHED MATERIAL. It says that "The following material will be provided as GFM for construction/ installation of the SWS site:"
 
"30' fold-over tower with anchor bolts"
 
"Cross Bar for Anemometer"  
 
However from page 4, in 1-1.2 Scope of Work number 8. says "Install/wire GFM power panel." Is this a correct statement and is the FAA going to furnish a power (electric) panel, which I take it that this may be the Square D "NQOD12M100CU" electric panel in a NEMA 3R enclosure with a Equipment Ground Bar (EGB) that is shown on drawing GYR-D-SWS-E002? If this is not correct, I believe there may be a problem because Square D does not show the NQOD12M100CU power panel as a currently made item. It is shown in the obsolescent Panelboard section in their Supplement Digest Catalog.

Answer: The following is GFM: 30' fold-over tower with anchor bolts, Cross Bar for Anemometer, Power Panel, LED Obstruction Light.

9.) Also from the Specifications, page 4, in 1-1.2 Scope of Work number 9. says to " Install/ wire GFM obstruction light, Dialight Dual Led Tower, as shown on the drawing. Again will this LED obstruction light by Dialight be furnished by the FAA since from the list of GFM does not show it OR will the installing contractor have to furnish it?

Answer:  LED Obstruction Light

10.) From drawing GYR-D-SWS-E002, where will the GFI Outlet need to be installed, because the drawings do not show where this will need to be done?

Answer: GFI Outlet shall be installed on the unist strut assembly next to the power panel.

<NTYPE>SNOTE
<CONTACT>Leslie A. Sayre
<DESC>THIS IS AN AMENDMENT TO SYNOPSIS OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.203.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ).
The Department of Energy (DOE), Golden Field Office (GFO) anticipates the issuance of a solicitation under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The U.S. Department of Energy?s (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) is commissioning impact and process evaluations for two national laboratory pilots aimed at supporting EERE?s national mission of producing high-impact research, development, and demonstration to make clean energy as affordable and convenient and breaking down barriers to market entry.  This solicitation will result in a firm-fixed price (FFP) service type contract to engage the services of a contractor to conduct a rigorous evaluation of these pilots.
The two laboratory pilots are: (1) Small Business Vouchers Pilot ? This pilot aims to, (a) Leverage national laboratory capabilities for economic development by establishing a laboratory voucher program for small business (b) Provide access to expertise, competencies, and equipment at all DOE national laboratories 
(2) Lab-Corps Pilot ? Announcements of this pilot are found at: (a) http://energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-new-lab-program-accelerate-commercialization-clean-energy (b) http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/10/29/empowering-entrepreneurial-labs-new-lab-corps-program-accelerates-energy-technologie
The purpose of the evaluation is to develop independent, quantitative estimates of the impacts as well as capture implementation lessons learned and make recommendations to DOE on ways to further improve the Lab-Corps and Small Business Vouchers investments if DOE wishes to scale up the investment after the pilot has ended.  Refer to Attachment 1 and Attachment 2 draft Statements of Work (SOW) for each of the pilots.
The pilots (Phase 1 and Phase 2) are expected to be completed within 61 months after the start of the project (assuming Phase 2 will be required).  The estimated total magnitude for Phase 1 and Phase 2 is $550,000.00.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 541618 with a size standard of $15.0.  This requirement is not being set-aside for any small business concerns.
DOE anticipates issuing a RFQ to award a contract to perform both impact and process evaluation of the two national laboratory pilots on or about January 5, 2015.  The awardee will be expected to start up the project in early February.  The RFQ will only be distributed to those companies with demonstrated capability on our vendor list using FedConnect (www.fedconnect.net) only.  If you are interested in this requirement, please send a capability statement to leslie.sayre@ee.doe.gov no later than 8:00 am (MT) January 5, 2015.  All future information about this RFQ, including any amendments, will only be available through FedConnect.  The anticipated award date for this contract is February 9, 2015.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for the following services under project number 596-15-103 - Abate Asbestos in Crawl Spaces at the Lexington VAMC, Leestown Division, in Lexington, Kentucky.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330. Interested firms should submit their current SF 330 to Matthew.Whisman@va.gov. The SF 330s are due on January 9, 2015 at 2:00 PM Eastern Standard Time.  VA Medical Center, Leestown Division, is seeking professional architect/engineering firms to design a construction project to Abate Asbestos in Crawl Spaces located at the VA Medical Center, Leestown Division, in Lexington, Kentucky.

GENERAL SCOPE OF WORK:  This project would abate crawl spaces containing friable asbestos pipe insulation, debris, and contaminated soil, allowing personnel to enter to perform maintenance and repairs.  Project will include removal of abandoned piping and insulation, removal of 2 to 4 inches of contaminated soil, placement of concrete cap over soil, air monitoring, and clearances required for normal use.  The A/E consultant will need to conduct all field investigation with personnel certified to enter a confined asbestos containing environment.  A Kentucky accredited asbestos inspector or asbestos management planner will be required to enter each space.  All insulation and elbows will need to be sampled per AHERA guidelines to determine percentage of asbestos present.  The A/E consultant will be required to complete detailed field investigative reports in all areas.  Current mechanical, electrical, and telecom systems in each area will need to be identified as active or inactive.  After abatement is complete, the active systems will need to be insulated and the inactive systems removed.  Multiple buildings will involve removal of insulation and dirt, multiple connectors will involve removal of insulation and dirt, and a select few buildings will involve removal of dirt only.  Project design shall clearly show work required, phasing of work required, and instructions to construction contractor regarding how to accomplish the necessary renovations in a 24/7 medical environment, taking into consideration demolition, dust control, infection control, and specialized facility requirements as discussed with VA staff.  Also included will be limitations, e.g. work required to be completed outside of standard administrative hours, work limited to periods shorter than a single shift, etc., for specific locations in the project.   

The estimated cost of construction range for project #596-14-103 is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.

The submitted SF330s will be evaluated on the following criteria:

(1)	Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.

(2)	Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials.
 
(3)	Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.

(4)	Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.

(5)	Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.

(6)	Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.

(7)	Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.

(8)	Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and their record of working together as a team.

The awarded A/E firm will prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified outside General Contracting companies can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired work. The awarded A/E firm is responsible for ensuring that the specifications and drawings supplied fully represent all of the work described in the Request for Proposal (RFP).   The Medical Center must remain operational throughout the construction period and a detailed sequence of work will be provided by the A/E to minimize impact of the construction.  The NAICS code for this project is 541310.

<p>Note and as a Reminder: This is an urgent procurment and must be awarded prior to January 1, 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This procurement is a set aside for small business authorized resellers of the manufacturer Informatica Corporaton product "Informatica Data Quality Advanced Edition 4-Core (licenses and software maintenance support). Provided below is the Justification and approval for other than full and open competition (Brand Name ONLY). The solicitaion SAQMMA15Q0051 is issued as Request For Quotation (RFQ) and will be posted within the hour. This is an urgent procurement and must be awarded prior to January 1, 2015. Details regarding submission of the quotes will be addressed in the solicitation.</p>
<p><br />&nbsp;JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL (J&amp;A)<br /><br /><br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State, is processing this Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) for the purchase of new Informatica Data Quality Advanced Edition 4-core that includes licenses, and software support services on behalf of Information Resource, Systems Integration Office (IRM/OPS/SIO). The estimated cost is $210,000.00.</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved. The Informatica Data Quality Advanced Edition 4-core will be incorporated into the Department existing Informatica Data Integration suite, with updated software (paragraph 3 provides details). The authority to be used in the procurement of this commercial software will be Subpart 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.</p>
<p>3. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the Department's needs.</p>
<p>The Department requires purchase of Informatica Data Quality Advanced Edition Suite for incorporation into the existing Informatica data integration suite, with updated software. The Advanced Edition 4-core software will improve data quality, data profiling, and data matching during the extract, transform, and load processes to integrate data from various sources across the department into the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW). This acquisition will ensure that the EDW continues to integrate data from multiple sources into meaningful information accessible to and used by Posts world-wide, which will enable expeditious response to internal and external data calls, as well as, facilitate data driven decision-making.</p>
<p>The initial product/software is already utilized at both Domestic and at Post world-wide. If the updated software is not purchased, the Department could lose the use of the licenses, and software support will stop. Importantly, it is certain that the Department's current informatica data suite risk not being able to provide accurate, current, and complete data, placing many programs at risk and financial loss.</p>
<p>4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. <br /><br />41 USC 253&copy;(1), FAR 6.302-1, FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. <br /><br />The Informatica product is used to build data quality metrics, help identify data quality issues during the ETL process, and improve workflows to integrate data from multiple enterprise level systems. This product provides full integration to the existing EDW architecture. Use of any other product would require the program office to redesign and recreate the EDW architecture which is not cost affective at this time.</p>
<p>6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable <br /><br />A FedBizOpps notice will be publicized as required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and FAR 6.302-1(c )(A)(B)(C). This justification covers only the portion of the acquisition which is brand name or peculiar to one manufacturer. The product is The Informatica Data Quality Advanced Edition 4-cor manufactured only by Informatica Corporation. Therefore, the justification and approval is for this basis only.</p>
<p>7. A determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will make a fair and reasonable price determination in accordance with FAR 13.106.3. The manufacturer Informatica Corporation offers' this product to the general public. This product/software is for commercial use, including support and the price list is also published.</p>
<p>8. A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted. <br /><br />A market survey was conducted by the IRM/ SIO Office, evaluating the capabilities of other software companies when the initial software was purchased from Informatica Corporation. ISO researched the internet of the products available on the market, and finally, three separate in-person meetings which included a demonstration of three different products were conducted. However, although a market survey has been conducted previously, it's essential to the Government's requirements, to preclude consideration of a product manufactured by another company.</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are used as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been identified as the only products that will meet the Department's requirements to continue to be seamlessly and without interruption or delay provide interactive training materials online, webinars, remote meetings and online sessions.</p>
<p>10. A listing of sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>No other sources have expressed interest in writing or otherwise in this acquisition.</p>
<p>11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.</p>

<DESC>TITLE: Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) for the Wideband Training and Certification System (WTCS).    <br>      <br>   Contract Vehicle: TBD    <br>      <br>   Brief Summary: This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is being issued as a follow-on to the WTCS Request for Information (RFI) dated 15 May 2014. Since the posting of the RFI, the Government has generated the technical documentation of this requirement and is hereby providing Industry with an opportunity to respond to this technical information.  The WTCS technical documentation includes the following:   <br>      <br>   - Draft Statement of Work (SOW)    <br>   - Draft System Specification   <br>      <br>   Market research is being conducted to determine interested sources and capabilities of contractors for the procurement of the WTCS.  Interested sources are invited to provide a capability statement to deliver the WTCS capability as described in the attached technical documentation.   <br>      <br>   BRIEF DESCRIPTION:    <br>   The WTCS shall be an interactive training system to train military and/or civilian operators on the Wideband SATCOM Operational Management System (WSOMS) and its associated subsystems to support the Army's Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) 25S, the Satellite Systems Network Coordinator Course Additional Skill Identifier (ASI) 1C training course located at the USACCoE, Ft. Gordon, GA.  The WTCS will also be installed at the Wideband Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Communications Operation Centers (WSOCs) to be used for sustainment training and operator certification.   <br>      <br>   The WTCS may be based on an approach that involves a combination of software virtualization, application simulations, and/or other best commercial practice training delivery approaches to support WSOMS task training, evaluation, and certification activities.   <br>      <br>   The objectives of the WTCS program are:    <br>  <br>   a. Develop a training system to provide support to the initial training of the Satellite Systems/Network Coordinator Course, ASI 1C by providing interactive training capabilities that simulate real-world operational situations and provide the look and feel of the following subsystems:    <br>      <br>   1)	Common Network Planning Subsystem (CNPS)    <br>   2)	DSCS Integrated Management System (DIMS)   <br>   3)	Frequency Conversion Subsystem (FCS)   <br>   4)	Global Satellite Configuration Control Element (GSCCE) (with the training simulation limited to the ground managers tasks)   <br>   5)	Global Terrestrial Critical Control Circuit System (GTC3S)   <br>   6)	Joint Management Operations Subsystem (JMOS)   <br>   7)	Remote Monitoring and Control Equipment (RMCE)   <br>   8)	Replacement Frequency Modulated Order Wire (RFMOW)   <br>   9)	Replacement Patch and Test Facility (RPTF)   <br>   10)	Replacement Radio Frequency Interconnecting Subsystem (RRFIS)   <br>   11)	Wideband Remote Monitoring Sensor (WRMS)   <br>   12)	Replacement Satellite Configuration Control Element (RSCCE   <br>  <br>   b. Develop a system to simulate the functional capabilities of WSOMS systems and subsystems and be fully interactive; have a high availability, low-failure, low-maintenance capability; be locally controllable and maintainable; and be fully-supportable and upgradeable.   <br>  <br>   c. Provide training modules with simulated capabilities of the WSOMS systems and subsystems between control systems and tools that emulate traffic flow, interfaces, and operations.   <br>  <br>   d. Ensure the delivered WTCS meets Government defined performance requirements; Risk Management Framework (RMF) and Information Assurance (IA) requirements; Test requirements; and Integrated Logistics requirements.   <br>  <br>   e. Provide for a Trainer Management System (TMS) designed to manage WTCS training content and individual, crew, and unit performance records; support the scheduling of WTCS training resources and activities; and support all trainer administrative functions to include controlling and managing access and WTCS privilege levels.   <br>  <br>   f. Provide sustainment training in support of the training and evaluation requirements for WSOC facilities by providing training and evaluation capabilities that allow users to receive real-time experience without any risks; tracks user progress; offers a way to learn at a user's own pace; and creates engaging and interactive training scenarios and programs of instruction.   <br>  <br>   g. Provide the ability for organizational leadership to evaluate individual and crew readiness on non-routine tasks without affecting current operations.   <br>  <br>   h. Provide standardized and automated evaluation of organizational training activities, execution of operator training tasks, and evaluation of training.   <br>  <br>   i. Provide an avenue for knowledgeable operators to request adjustments to training tasks in order to maintain consistency with changing Concepts of Operations (CONOPS) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).   <br>      <br>   The WTCS may leverage specific modules of excellence from DOCS Training System (DTS) that pertain to WGS and other delivered simulation system capabilities into an interactive training system that meets institutional training requirements IAW Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) standards, USACCoE and WSOC operator training requirements for U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/U.S. Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ARSTRAT), 1st Space Brigade, and the 53rd Signal Battalion.    <br>      <br>   The WTCS shall consist of standalone workstations as well as workstations networked between instructors and students in a controlled classroom environment.    <br>  <br>   The WTCS shall include a free-play, self-paced training application to support USACCoE controller training and evaluation.

<AWARDEE>SSPC, 40 24th Street, Floor 6, Pittsburgh, PA 15222-4600 US
<DESC>Washington Headquarters Services (WHS)/ Acquisition Directorate (AD) awarded a contract to provide corrosion training to Department of Defense (DOD) personnel in support of the DOD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan, section III, subsection E, paragraph 4, Working Integrated Product Team (WIPT) Policies, Mission, Objectives and Strategies: Training and Certification WIPT. The corrosion training curriculum shall address the general areas of corrosion control, cathodic protection (CP), and coating inspection. This curriculum establishes a foundational understanding and the knowledge base required for a DOD workforce trained in the understanding of corrosion prevention and control issues for DOD equipment and infrastructure. The contractor shall provide and administer corrosion training curricula to DOD military and civilian personnel, and as required, work in coordination with the Government to update the curriculum to address specific DOD training requirements. Depending on the specific training topic, corrosion courses may include in-person classroom lectures, online coursework, or a combination of both.
<p>This action was procured on an open market, competitive basis for a 12-month base period plus four 12-month option periods.</p>
<p>The requirement was structured to maximize the use of firm-fixed-price by establishing an estimated number of Government employees anticipated to attend each course required by the DOD to be included within the training program. This estimated number was derived from historic and current training metrics such as total DOD students per training course were obtained from the Corrosion Prevention and Control Integrated Product Team (CPC IPT), specifically from Training &amp; Certification Working Integrated Team (T&amp;C WIPT). A set number of training courses and administrative services are required and can be easily proposed on an annual basis. One firm-fixed-priced contract line item number (CLIN) per year is contained in the schedule for the training, which will be invoiced at a monthly rate. The annual travel CLINs on the contract are considered reimbursable, but are for pre-determined amounts stated by the Government and require Government pre-approval before the contractor may plan or execute travel. These CLINs will only be paid at the actual cost. Listing these CLINs in a firm-fixed-price nature on the contract would not be in the best interest of the Government since part or all of the travel may not be used because it is not possible at the time of placing the contract to accurately estimate the extent or duration of the travel or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. The firm-fixed-price CLINs equate to the higher portion of the value of the overall contract.</p>
