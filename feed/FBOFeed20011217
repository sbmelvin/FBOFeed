<DESC>The USDA Agricultural Research Service in Aberdeen, ID has a potential requirement for 
60 tons  normal corn seed  per spec & 60 tons  Low phytate corn seed per spec.available for pickup 12-31-2001 or before. We require equal sufficient amounts of grain produced by two corn
"iso-hybrids": 1) grain produced by a normal hybrid that produces grain with
"normal" levels of total phosphorus, that's about 3 to 4 mg total phosphorus
per gram of grain, and "normal" levels of phytic acid, where phytic acid
represents from 75% to 85% of grain total phosphorus; 2) grain produced by a
"Low Phytate" iso-hybrid (largely similar in every way to the normal hybrid
except in one or a few genes that alter the phytic acid level), where the
grain again has normal levels of total phosphorus, but phytic acid
phosphorus is reduced by at least 80%. These grain types should be produced under "similar" production conditions and packaged in 40 lb bags.   A solicitation is not available for this potential procurement action and the USDA plans to negotiate with the only known source; Alder Seed Company Sharpsville, IN.  Interested firms are encouraged to submit proposals based on the above.  There may be future requirements in the spring of 2002. See number note 22.*****

<DESC>The Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) has a requirement to expand its existing RF switch matrix facilities at its Sri Lanka Transmitting Station, located in Iranawila, Sri Lanka.

Therefore, this proposed procurement will be awarded on a non-competitive basis to Marconi Mobile in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  The specific requirement is for approximately 25 RF cross point switches, power and control cabling, arc detectors, and engineering "as-built" drawings and related technical support.  Interested firms or individuals may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement, in writing, by submitting their qualifications and any other information related to satisfying this requirement to the Contracting Officer by COB on January 11, 2002.  Any information received by the Contracting Officer will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any questions (technical or otherwise) related to this proposed procurement shall be in writing and sent directly and only to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Brent Peavler, for this procurement at the above stated address.  This public notice is not an IFB, RFQ, or RFP.

<DESC>Per FAR 15.201, FHWA will conduct a pre-proposal conference starting at 1:30 PM on January 24, 2002 Doors open at 1 PM. at: Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center (TFHRC), 6300 Georgetown Pike, McLean, VA 22101, Building T, Rm T104-105. Please see http://www.tfhrc.gov/about/tfdirect.htm for directions.

The objective of -Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) Core Algorithms and Data Sets- is to develop a core of open behavioral algorithms in support of microscopic traffic simulation, with supporting documentation and validation data sets that describe the interactions of multi-modal travelers, vehicles and highway systems, and interactions presented to them from traffic control devices, delineation, congestion and other features of the environment.  These products will be openly distributed and made freely available to the broad transportation community. FHWA has undertaken some recent activities aimed at examining its future role in traffic simulation and traffic analysis tools.  Based on these activities, the FHWA Office of Travel Management has formulated the Traffic Analysis Tools Program.  The goals of the program are to achieve wider acceptance and use of traffic analysis tools and to ensure the tools can be trusted to provide accurate results. Development efforts will be focused on developing new tools and improving the analytical foundation of existing tools.  FHWA will work with the private sector market and not compete with it.  FHWA will not develop nor procure a successor to the CORSIM model. But instead will develop and assemble freely available and well-documented fundamental data sets and algorithms to foster a market place in which new or existing simulation products can be rapidly refined and validated. NOTE: All electronic and information technology deliverables rendered under this effort must comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Access Board Standards available for viewing at http://www.section508.gov.  This solicitation will only be available electronically at http://www.eps.gov.  Accordingly, NO written, telephone, facsimile or email requests for the solicitation package will be accepted.  The Government anticipates issuing a solicitation on January 14, 2002 by posting it on the FedBizOpps website at http://www.eps.gov/.  The actual due date for proposals will be stated in the Request for Proposals. AMENDMENTS to the solicitation will NOT be mailed to prospective offerors.  Instead, it is the responsibility of interested parties to MONITOR the FedBizOpps website at http://www.eps.gov/ for any solicitation Amendments.

<DESC>This scope of work describes services to be provided by the Contractor to USAID/West Bank and Gaza Mission Strategic Objective Team 8 (Improving Community Services).  The Strategic Object Team seeks timely, appropriate, effective interventions that respond directly to the hardships being faced by average Palestinians as a result of the current situation.  In particular, the Mission wishes to:

a. Provide resources to the Palestinian community, using Palestinian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as the delivery vehicle, that will contribute to impeding the process of disintegration that is negatively impacting critical sectors, including the economy, health, education, and services that reach out to particularly vulnerable populations, including children, women, the elderly, the disabled, the chronically impoverished and populations that are geographically or sociologically marginalized.
b. Identify critical (including emergency) needs of constituent populations of Palestinian NGOs and to deliver services to those populations.
c. Establish a system of grants-making to Palestinian NGOs in order to support their response to emergency needs and to provide critically needed services to people who will not be able to otherwise access those services.

Under this Scope of Work the Contractor will implement a $10 million, 2 year program that will provide grants to Palestinian non-governmental organizations to support delivery of services to the Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  These services are anticipated to illustratively include, but not be limited to, employment generation, health, social welfare services, education, rehabilitation, emergency food support strategies, assistance to farmers and the agricultural sector, seasonal response (e.g. winterization, drought relief), and shelter rehabilitation.

The Contractor will:

a. Design and implement a grant-making project component that is accessible and user friendly to even small, community-based Palestinian NGOs.
b. Design and implement a method of ongoing rapid needs assessment to ascertain that grants are targeting needy populations and are not redundant or duplicative of other USAID, donor, United Nations Relief and Work Agency (UNWRA), or community efforts.
c. Design and manage a system to support procurements that may need to be undertaken by Palestinian NGOs lacking the administrative and managerial capacity to conform to USAID procurement regulations and guidelines.
d. Design and implement a monitoring and evaluation system for the grant-making and service delivery of recipient organizations. This system must be capable of accurately ascertaining that assistance is effectively reaching needy populations and assessing the impact of the assistance provided.  NAICS code is 813219, Other Grantmaking and Giving Services.  The Small Business Size Standard is $5,000,000.  Estimated Cost Not To Exceed $10,000,000.  See attached solicitation.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Autonomous Operations (AO) Future Naval Capability (FNC) is soliciting proposals from industry, academic institutions, and other agencies for the development of affordable technology solutions and the validation of performance capabilities required for the future Gladiator Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle (TUGV) program. 
The Gladiator is an unmanned, tele-operated/semi-autonomous, highly mobile ground vehicle system intended to provide the United States Marine Corps (USMC) Ground Combat Element (GCE) with a variety of mission capabilities that will allow the detection, location, and neutralization of threats while reducing its risk exposure.  Examples of these desired capabilities are:  reconnaissance, surveillance, and targeting acquisition (RSTA); direct fire; obstacle breaching; chemical/biological weapon detection; obscurant delivery; engineering reconnaissance; communication relay; and tactical deception.  The Gladiator system will consist of a base mobility platform known as a Mobile Base Unit (MBU) controlled by an Operator Control Unit (OCU) via a radio frequency (RF) link.  The MBU will have built-in RSTA equipment and will be capable of seamlessly accommodating different Mission Payload Modules (MPM's) according to current mission needs.  The Gladiator must be small and lightweight enough so that two vehicle systems can be transported in the cargo area of an M1123 High Mobility Multi Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV A2).  It must be simple and durable enough to withstand extreme environments and abuse.  A system weight of eight hundred (800) pounds, including payload and Operator Control Unit (OCU) has been established as a target.  To be effective, the Gladiator must be capable of traversing all types of terrain, including soft soils, hills, vertical obstacles, negative obstacles, and water obstacles.  The Gladiator is intended to operate in hostile areas that would normally pose substantial risk to Marines.  It may be the recipient of, and engage in, direct fire activities.  It must be capable of surviving threats that include small-arms (7.62 mm) fire at close range and anti-personnel mines and grenades.  Since the Gladiator will suffer attrition as a result of operating in high risk environments, system affordability is of paramount importance.  A target Average Unit Production Cost (AUPC) of the base system (MBU and OCU) is $150K.  A complete description of system performance goals can be referenced in the document Desired Operational Performance Characteristics for a Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle.

Concurrently satisfying the stated performance parameters in an affordable manner will be a challenge.  The Office of Naval Research intends to award up to four (4) simultaneous contracts in FY02 for the first of a two-phase process to help shape the definition of the future Gladiator and, with the contractor, verify whether or not the majority of the requirements can be simultaneously and cost-effectively achieved.  The Phase I efforts will involve the investigation, design, and development of unmanned ground vehicle technologies in the areas of command and control, mobility, modularity, system signature reduction, durability, and survivability, which are vital to achieving system performance goals.   A preliminary system design and performance specification shall be the primary products delivered to the Government at the end of this phase and shall form the basis for a down-select decision to qualify for the Phase II.  Phase I is anticipated to last ten (10) months.  The next phase of the program will continue to refine the preliminary designs, identify and build candidate technology solutions, test them individually and in concert with each other, and finally integrate them together into mobility platforms called Technology Demonstration Models (TDM's) for performance testing and demonstrations.  Phase II is anticipated to last fourteen (14) months.  The products of the ON

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

In order to develop a mutually agreed upon Statement of Work, the salient requirements of the task order, will be scoped by the Government/Contractor Team.  The awarded task order will be a performance scoped, firm fixed price task order with a specific completion date.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and capability of offerors to provide a building ventilation contaminate detection and protection system. This information is required by the Government prior to the release of any potential solicitation.  Responses will be used to determine if there are multiple products commercially available meeting the CDC's requirement. The CDC requires that such a package meet the following criteria:
1) Continuous airflow sensor detection technology to detect bio-terrorism organisms or chemicals that could be introduced into building ventilation systems. Sensor should be able to interface directly with building automation systems and life safety alarms. Sensor should be programmable for different contaminates, operate within industrial, commercial, or laboratory HVAC duct systems, and have demonstrated reliability and maintainability features comparable to other building system components.
2) Protection technology sufficiently robust to mitigate potential bio-terrorism organisms or chemicals that could be introduced into building ventilation systems. System should not require replacement of existing building systems - either mechanical or electrical. Failure mode should be definite, and integration is desired with sensor technology above - so that failures or breaches of contaminants into the building systems are immediately detected. Reliability and maintainability features shall be comparable to other building system components.
This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and in no way obligates the government to award any contract.  No RFP is available and CDC is not committed to make an award pursuant to this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.  Availability of the formal solicitation will be announced separately.  Interested offerors should furnish two copies of their capability information addressing the criteria cited to the attention of Jennifer J. Nelson at the address listed above.  Information packages should be received within 15 calendar days of this notification.  The capability information packages should not exceed 7 pages.

<DESC>The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) serves the educational needs of dependents of the military and civilian employees through its DoD Dependents Schools (DoDDS) located abroad, and the Domestic Dependents Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS) located stateside.  DoDDS enrolls approximately 78,000 students annually in grades pre-kindergarten through 12 and DDESS enrolls approximately 35,000 students in the same grades.  The DoDEA school system offers a typical American education and uses materials and equipment comparable to stateside schools.  DoDEA is responsible for purchasing systemwide assessment materials for students in the Department of Defense Dependents Schools (Section 1413 of Title XIV, Public Law 95-561, Defense Dependent Education Act) and in the Department of Defense Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (Section 216-4 of Chapter 108 of title 10, United States Code).  The procedures for regularly updating assessment materials are defined in the DoDEA Curriculum Development/Assessment Adoption Cycle.  In addition, DoDEA has implement a new Community Strategic Plan (CSP) as of the fall of 2001, which identifies various system assessments, and are required to measure progress toward the goals of the CSP.   DoDEA requires a "commercial off the shelf" (COTS) assessment for U.S. History.  This U.S. History Assessment will be aligned with the DoDEA Performance Standards for that course.  It is desirable for the U.S. History assessment to have at least two forms of the assessments, which consist of new equivalent, items each year, or include software that will allow generation of multiple, equivalent forms of the assessment. The U.S. History assessment must allow for local scoring of student work or publisher scoring within 21 days.   If publisher scoring is used, DoDEA will also require the contractor to provide a comprehensive system of printed summary and individual student reports, to meet the agency's need for data, as well as an electronic copy (CDROM) of summary and individual student performance data.   Offerors will be required to provide three (3) review sets of the published copyrighted US History assessment materials for evaluation, during the solicitation process. The sets of materials must be clearly marked and include a list of items in the review set.  Materials for review shall consist of student assessment booklets (multiple forms), administration instructions, sample individual and summary reports, software, and related support materials, if available. Electronic assessments are acceptible.  If the assessment submitted for review is in electronic form (CD or web accessible), clearly written complete and detailed instructions for accessing the materials is required. Software submitted for review must be either NT or Windows 98 compatible.  DoDEA will conduct a review of all published assessments submitted during the solicitation process, using specific criteria to rate the assessments' suitability for use with students served by the Agency.   If the review process clearly identifies all assessments as inadequate and does not meet DoDEA's needs, an evaluation process may not be implemented.  If the review process clearly identifies one assessment as superior to meet DoDEA's needs, an evaluation process may be conducted using the selected assessment to identify areas where written or training guidance are needed.  If 2-3 assessments are identified as potentially acceptible to meet the needs of the Agency, each of those assessments may be evaluated to gauge student and educator satisfaction with the instruments.  The evaluation process is anticipated to begin in spring 2002 and includes approximately 90 students.  Following the evaluation process, a determination will be made as to which instrument, if any, meets the needs of DoDEA.  At the conclusion of the evaluation process, an awardee(s) may be granted to fully implement the assessments for all students (approximat

<DESC>Background:
The National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Rapid Access to Intervention Development program (RAID) is designed to utilize NCI contract resources to assist extramural investigators with the preclinical and clinical development requirements for drugs and biologics that will be used in clinical trials. As part of these new initiative qualified sources is being sought who can produce clinical-grade vaccinia virus seeds for use in vaccine trials. 

Description of Work:
To establish two (2) vaccinia viral seed stocks that encode tumor antigens that are expressed at sufficient levels for eventual cGMP production of candidate vaccines for the treatment of cervical carcinoma. Preclinical data have shown that both recombinant DNA and vaccinia constructs containing the gene/genes of interest can be used as vaccines to generate both specific helper and cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) as well as anti-tumor effects in animal models. A synergistic effect is seen when using the DNA and vaccinia constructs in a prime-boost regimen.  The manufacture of the DNA vaccines is already underway and will be used in separate clinical trials.  

Contractor must be able to create two (2) high titer recombinant vaccinia viral seed stocks in fully qualified cell lines that can be eventually used for the manufacture of recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing tumor antigens according to cGMP.  These viruses will be utilized in Phase I /II clinical studies in cervical carcinoma.  

Specific Requirements Include:
1.	Recombinant vaccinia shuttle vectors, harboring the genes encoding the tumor antigens of interest will be supplied to the contractor by SAIC/NCI. 

2.	The Wyeth Strain of vaccinia virus may be used for generating the recombinant vaccinia virus seed stocks. 

3.	The recombinant vaccinia virus may be created via initial transfection into qualified recipient cells. Recombination and plaque selection may be facilitated by thymidine kinase, -negative qualified HuTK-143B cells.  These cells will be supplied to the contractor by the SAIC. 

4.	Subsequent to multiple rounds of plaque purification, confirmation of the expression  (potency) and identity of the cervical tumor antigen(s) will be required.  Identity testing  should include, in addition to classical molecular analyses, nucleotide sequencing of the transgene and its flanking sequences.

5.	Potency testing minimally should include immunoprecipitation and/or Western Blot analyses of the gene expression.  Appropriate reagents will be obtained from the RAID Principal Investigator and provided to the Contractor by SAIC/NCI.

6.	The purified plaque containing the correct gene sequence and expression profile will be amplified into qualified  cells to produce the respective two (2) Master Viral Seed Stocks.

Contractor Must be Able to Deliver:
Two (2) vials of viral seed stock containing the respective vectors containing the specific genes of interest.  All release criteria will be established in advance so that the Contractor will be aware of the exact requirements needed to produce acceptable products.

Interested companies should describe their capabilities and experience and respond by January 17, 2002 to NCI-Frederick, P.O. Box B, Miller Drive, Building 244, Frederick, Maryland  21702.
