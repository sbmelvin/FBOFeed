<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) intends to issue a solicitation for Research and Development of a Dockable Person-Wearable Self-Contained Self-Rescuer (SCSR).  
Federal mining regulations (30 CFR 75.1714) require that every person who goes into an underground coal mine in the United States be supplied with a (SCSR) and trained in its use.  An SCSR is an emergency breathing apparatus designed for the purpose of mine escape.  It must be capable of providing a breathable atmosphere for one-hour and must be approved by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).  Workshops have identified new and emerging technologies, such as engineered materials or system designs that could support the development of smaller, lighter weight, or longer duration SCSRs.  One of the new SCSR technology identified is an extendable-life, or more commonly referred to as a dockable, person-wearable, SCSR.  A dockable SCSR allows a user to replace or add consumable supplies while the respirator is in use.  The overall effect would be the ability for a user to begin self-rescue with a relatively small, person-wearable device, extending the duration of protection as they proceed without having to remove the respirator, or otherwise open the closed breathing circuit to the ambient atmosphere.  This is an improvement over existing designs in that users would not have to perform multiple donnings in order to achieve an escape duration longer than that which could be accommodated by any existing SCSR. 

A Research and Development contract is anticipated.  The Institute anticipates that the period of performance for this effort will be 18 months; 6 months for Research and Development, and 12 months for Prototype Construction and Validation Testing.  Request for Proposal No. 2007-N-08847 will be issued on an unrestricted basis to full and open competition.  The solicitation will be available on or about September 15, 2006, and proposals due by October 16, 2006.  Organizations interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation may submit a written request to DHHS/PHS/CDC, Contracts Management Branch, P.O. Box 18070, Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236-0070. Written requests for the solicitation documents may be sent to the above address, faxed to (412) 386-6429, or sent via e-mail to dstaudt@cdc.gov.  No telephone requests will be accepted. Solicitation documents will also be available at www.fbo.gov.  All responsible responsive sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory has a requirement to help develop and evaluate a hybrid self-rescuer (HSR) that will meet the requirements of 42 CFR Part 84 and Federal Mining Regulations. Federal mining regulations, 30 CFR 75.1714, require that every person who goes into an underground coal mine in the United States be supplied with a Self-Contained Self-Rescuer (SCSR) and trained in its use. An SCSR is an emergency breathing apparatus designed for the purpose of mine escape. It must be capable of providing a breathable atmosphere for one-hour and must be approved by the Mine Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. SCSR use has helped save lives of miners, but the size and weight of the so-called first generation one-hour SCSRs made in-mine caching necessary. A government, industry, and labor task force was formed to determine how SCSRs could be made more accessible to the miner, and concluded that an SCSR should be worn on the belt of a miner like a filter self-rescuer (FSR), and determined that in order to be belt wearable, size and weight should be no more than about twice that of an FSR. Apparatus that meet this size and weight criteria are called SCSRs. A new SCSR technology identified was a HSR. A HSR is a combination of an SCSR and a FSR. The SCSR component would provide closed-circuit life support, supplying oxygen, while removing carbon dioxide. When the oxygen supply had been consumed, the HSR would switch over into an open-circuit FSR mode, scrubbing the ambient air, removing toxic gases such as carbon monoxide and particulates. An HSR would be similar in size and weight compared to existing SCSRs, but would provide extended protective capacity. Recently enacted legislation by Federal and several State governments require additional supplies of breathable air for individuals trapped underground during a mine escape. However, if a miner can not make good on an escape, the additional supply of SCSRs may not be sufficient to enable the trapped miners to survive until mine rescue teams can reach them. If HSRs are available, it would add an extra layer of protection for trapped miners. Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 2007-N-08848 will be issued on an unrestricted basis to full and open competition. The solicitation will be issued on or about September 15, 2006, and proposals will be due on or about October 16, 2006. Organizations interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation may submit a written request to DHHS/PHS/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NIOSH - Pittsburgh, Acquisition and Assistance Field Branch V, Post Office Box 18070, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236-0070. Written requests submitted by facsimile to telephone number 412-386-6429 will be accepted. No telephone requests will be accepted. Please cite the solicitation number in your request. Offerors may obtain a copy of the RFP via the internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. All responsible responsive sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) intends to solicit a proposal and negotiate a sole source bridge contract with Sentech Incorporated for professional engineering and technical support services to Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Office of Technology Development (TD).  The proposed bridge contract will provide the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Technology Development the means to support the R&D mission and vision of the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy with technical, engineering, analytical, and management support.  The services are generally to include, but not be limited to, assistance in preparation of briefings and presentations, development of program plans and evaluations, coordination of meetings and documents, preparation of technology transfer products, preparation of budget or financial documents, and technical review of scientific and engineering studies and analyses. The services are currently being performed by Sentech Incorporated under Department of Energy Contract Number DE-AC01-01EE50624, which will expire on October 22, 2006. The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this contract is Section 303[c][1] of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act, 10 USC 2304[c][1], and implemented by FAR 6.302-1[a][2][ii][B], which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; and when it is likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. Sentech has been supporting TD for more than 10 years and has the technical expertise in the energy-intensive industries and processes that are the focus of EERE R&D. The incumbent is currently and extensively assisting TD with several on-going activities which are of critical importance to various programs operations.  As such, this strategic knowledge and experience to provide uninterrupted support to TD with program planning, implementation, and evaluation necessitates the award of a bridge contract to the incumbent contractor, Sentech Incorporated. There are no solicitation documents available for this requirement. Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates the firms ability to provide the services, as described above. Interested parties may submit a proposal and rationale as to why they should be considered by September 15, 2006 to: Ms. Patricia Espinoza, MA-642.1, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20585. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive acquisition. The intent of this award is to provide the required support services to EERE until the award and transition of a competitive follow-on acquisition is completed. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this requirement is 541330. The period of performance is for a total of nine months, consisting of one 3-month base period and two 3-month option periods.

<DESC>SUBJECT:   MODEL SPJ-216-X4RT10 PULSE JET FABRIC DUST COLLECTOR DESC:  The U.S. Department of Energys National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to Science Dust Collectors, Alsip, IL to purchase the following items (to be deliver to our site in Albany, OR): 1.  Science Dust Collectors Model SPJ-216-X4RT10 Pulse Jet Fabric Dust Collector  1 each. 2.  Full set of Ryton Singed Fabric type bags (qty 216  10 ft long  1 each. 3.  Enclosed Ladder  1 each. 4.  Slide Gates 11-1/4 x 11-1/4  2 each. 5.  Drum adapters for 55 gal drum  2 each. 6.  High temperature option  1 each. 7.  High temperature Epoxy paint and sandblast inside and outside  1 each. 8.  Extra set of Tyton  8 long bags  1 each. This purchase order is being issued to Science Dust Collectors because the NETL Albany site has a number of continuous and non-continuous cleaning bag houses on center.  Scientific Dust Collectors has supplied all of the recent continuous cleaning bag houses for the center.  Significant amounts of funding can be saved by standardizing on one brand of continuous cleaning bag houses. This would allow for the stocking and purchasing of only one set of spares for these systems and would save in ease of maintenance though less training and familiarization with the use of only one set of equipment.  No other vendor makes compatible systems that whose spare parts and components would interchange with the proposed system. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  All interested firms must respond to DE-RQ26-06NT00842.  Offerors shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability.

<SUBJECT>B -- Yucca Mountain Project, Structural Analysis on the Waste Packages and Ancillary Components
<SOLNBR>ENG-06-009

<DESC>1	Summary
Bechtel SAIC is seeking interested parties to perform non-linear structural analysis.  These analyses are for the Yucca Mountain waste packages and ancillary components (viz., the waste package emplacement pallets, drip shields and trunnion collars).  This work will be performed under the subcontractor's Quality Assurance (QA) program, which will be qualified for use in producing products usable by the Yucca Mountain Project suitable for citation in the License Application and to support definitive design of these components.  The purpose of this request is to identify interested parties to be qualified as vendors and put on the Qualified Supplier List.
2	Description of Work
2.1	Description of the Structural Analyses
The structural design of the waste packages and ancillary components for the Yucca Mountain Project involves determining the structural performance of these components against design basis events, off-normal events and normal operational evolutions.  Such analyses require the application of dynamic, non-linear Finite Element Analysis (FEA) structural analysis techniques that include plasticity in determining margin to structural failure.  Such determinations of margin to plastic collapse are based on the material structural limits found the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code with extensions to include plasticity and adaptations for estimating the stress fields within the subject components.  Adherence to project analysis methodology is an absolute requirement.  This includes, among many, NRC-reviewed techniques for ensuring adequate mesh refinement.  These analyses shall be performed with the state-of-the-art dynamic structural analysis code LS DYNA (LSTC 2003) to ensure compatibility with project processes and experience.  Additional analyses to be performed may include the computation of material failure by fracture using Fracture Mechanics techniques.  Repeated loading or cyclic loading is not anticipated for these components.
2.2	Sufficiency of Analyses
These analyses must be performed under a QA program that will be audited and approved by BSC QA.  Documentation requirements that exceed those in a typical approved NQA-1 program may be necessary.  Such requirements include the use of references that appear in project databases and compilations and the production of products and digital storage of results that are consistent with project processes.
3	Attributes of Qualified Subcontractor
3.1	Experience in Pertinent Analyses
The principals in candidate organizations must have at least ten years of experience in non-linear, dynamic structural analysis of metal components using Finite Element Analysis.  Such experience must be with a commercially available code, such as LS-DYNA or ABAQUS, which uses explicit numerical solution formulations.  (Equivalent experience with ABAQUS is judged to be sufficient for an easy migration to LS-DYNA.)  This should include demonstrable experience with the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (Section III or Section VIII, Division 2) pressure vessels.  The principals must also have a demonstrated capability to support product development from conceptual design through preliminary design and to definitive design.
3.2	Experience in Regulated Environment
The principals in the candidate organization should have experience in presenting and defending component structural analyses before the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
3.3	QA Program
Candidate organizations shall have an established NQA-1 program.
3.4	Computational Capabilities
Candidate organizations shall have computational capabilities to support as many as five simultaneous LS-DYNA solutions; each with at least five million degrees-of-freedom represented in double-precision storage.  Such solutions to a dynamic event of 30 milliseconds duration in real time must execute within five calendar days.  The candidate organization shall have sufficient staff to support this level of computational throughput and corresponding document production rates.
3.5	Non-linear Structural Analysis Tools
The organization must possess or be able to acquire licenses for the LS-DYNA code.  The mesh-generation for the finite element analysis must ensure that quadrilateral elements are used in high-stress and critical areas (i. e., no triangular mesh in such areas); therefore, the mesh generation program must give the analyst complete control over the detailed mesh.  If the organization does not have such mesh-generation software, it must be able to acquire such software.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to negotiate with the Screening Centers of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial for the Breast and Other Cancer Supplemental Data. The data to be collected is only available from women participants recruited in the PLCO Trial diagnosed with breast cancer in the screening and control arms.  The Screening Centers have been screening and abstracting this data since the inception of the study.  The PLCO Screening Centers include: the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute - N01-CN-25511; Georgetown University - N01-CN-25522; Henry Ford Hospital - N01-CN-25512; University of Minnesota, N01-CN-25513; University of Colorado Health Science Center - N01-CN-25514; Straub Pacific Health Research Institute - N01-CN-25515;  Washington University - N01-CN-25516; Marshfield Medical Research and Education Foundation - N01-CN-25518; University of  Utah - N01-CN-25524; and University of Alabama at Birmingham - N01-CN-75022. The Breast and Other Supplemental Data allows for abstracting pathology reports from other non screened cancers such as breast cancer, where limited pathology information has been recorded.  For the coordination of the Breast and Other Cancer Supplemental Data, NCI intends to negotiate with the Coordinating Center of the PLCO, Westat, Inc. - N01-CN-25476.  The Coordinating Center has developed monitoring and tracking programs that are proprietary and are essential to these participants and this project.  Study coordination includes: meeting with the NCI personnel to review progress and resolve problems; monitor progress and protocol adherence at screening centers and prepare monthly status reports; coordinate conference calls and provide minutes; maintain and update study-specific information. Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports a comprehensive extramural research program focused on all infectious agents (with the exception of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and includes basic research, such as studies of microbial biology and physiology; applied research, including the development of medical diagnostics; and clinical trials to evaluate experimental drugs and vaccines.  NIAID has a requirement to apply state-of-the-art high-throughput (HTP) structural biology technologies to experimentally characterize the three dimensional atomic structure of targeted proteins from pathogens in the NIAID Category A-C priority lists (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm) and organisms causing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.  The three dimensional structure of proteins can assist drug design and development by yielding direct insights into the target molecular mechanisms, in interaction with other biological molecules, or with synthetic compounds, in order to improve selectivity, specificity and optimize drug development in a rational way.

It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about September 28, 2007. This RFP will be available electronically on/about September 14, 2006, and may be accessed through the FEDBIZOPPS website and the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) home page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to award contracts. No collect calls will be accepted.

The purchase of this instrument from Rigaku Americas Corporation, 9009 New Trails Drive, The Woodlands, TX 77381, is requested to continue studies in the Structural Biochemistry section. This device has an electron focal spot size not larger than 70 micron X 700 microns, so that optimum X-ray flux density and beam divergence can be achieved through a 0.25 mm collimator after 3-fold magnification that is fixed by a current VariMax-HF X-ray optical system.  The generator must accept loading of 1.2 kW at this source size.  The generator has to provide geometry, such that the mid-point of the VariMax-HF X-ray optical system is 145 mm from the X-ray source point on the target surface.  In order to reduce vibration effects and therefore achieve maximum source stability, the X-ray generator must be of a direct drive type.  The generator must be equipped with automatic focusing voltage (bias) control in order to achieve optimum electron beam focusing and  pre-aligned and pre-crystallized filaments must be available.  Manual filament alignment procedures are not acceptable and the X-ray shutter systems supplied with the generator must be compatible and work with the interlock system of the existing radiation enclosure.  The X-ray shutter must not open when a user is inside of the enclosure.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a purchase order on a sole source non-competitive basis to Affymetrix Inc. 3420 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, California. FDA will purchase Custom E. Coli Genechip Microarrays.  The Genechip microarrays are to be utilized with an existing integrated Affymetrix Genechip scanner 3000 and Fluidics 450s systems.   The following instrument specifications are met only by Affyrmetrix and no other known instrument in the market.  The arrays are able to be read and utilized by the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 System which is currently being utilized by our FDA laboratory. The GeneChip Scanner 3000 System is a fully integrated platform for conducting research using the Affymetrix GeneChip? Custom Genotyping assays and GeneChip probe arrays. The system includes the GeneChip Scanner 3000, Fluidics Station 450s, Hybridization Oven 640, a powerful computer workstation with dual Xeon processors loaded with GeneChip Operating Software.  The arrays are high-density probe arrays capable of performing quantitative and simultaneous monitoring of thousands of genes. The arrays are able to accommodate at least 22,000 unique E.coli genes and 1,000 control sequences (23,000 total probe sets).  Each of the gene sequence represented on the arrays have 11 perfectly matched 25-mer probes as well as 11 mismatch 25-mer probes in order to estimate nonspecific hybridization. This results in an array capable of accommodating >500,000 individual features. Additionally, the sizes of each of these features are 11 microns.  The arrays contain the following hybridization controls: bioB, bioC, bioD and cre., and a normalization control set of 100 probe sets. The microarrays are unique and are available solely from Affymetrix.  FDA intends to make an award immediately after the response date of this notice.  This is not a request for quotes; however sources may submit descriptive literature, fully documenting their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency.  A determination to compete this procurement based on response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The non-competitive award will be made in accordance with FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Health Promotion Research Branch (HPRB), Behavioral Research Program (BRP), plans to procure on a sole source basis with Deborah J. Toobert, Ph.D., 3968 Brae Burn Drive, Eugene, OR 97405 to lead and collaborate with members of the Society of Behavioral Medicine, Evidence-Based Behavioral Medicine Subcommittee, the International Society for Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, extramural Investigators and other NCI staff to coordinate and direct a system-wide review, data analysis, synthesis of the evidence, and interpretation of the information. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 and the business size standard is $6.5M.

The Health Promotion Research Branch, Behavioral Research Program has a requirement to determine where the gaps exist and a method to address these gaps in evidence reported in literature to promote diet and physical activity change.  Consequently, recent reviews are critical on the quality of literature in the field.  There is great variability in how the evidence is reported.  A deficiency exists in the consistency for how evidence is reported in the literature (e.g. Ammerman/Whitlock/Bowen reviews).  There is a great need for comparable units in how diet and physical activity measurement is reported.  Without consistency, it becomes increasingly difficult to enable study comparison across trials and interventions.  In order to develop a concise methodology to address the gaps, scientific staffs in the HRB recognize the need to engage with scientists from the extramural community who are internationally recognized leaders in the field of diet and exercise.  

Specifically, the HRB/NCI has to determine where gaps exist and what needs to happen to address these gaps.  So, this project will detail the problems based on published literature, give suggestions on how to address them, via improvement in reporting in the literature, new directions in evidence synthesis, and other ideas to be determined. The major issues to be addressed are the Study Design, Theoretical framing/interventions issues on broad range, Recruitment characteristics and population selection, Measurement and assessment constructs, and Issues of population versus individual response.  The Scientist must have considerable experience in measurement development, disease management interventions for a variety of chronic diseases, and health behavior change interventions with older women; at least 23 years of effective dietary self-management work with older type 2 diabetes patients; recent work to improve lifestyle behaviors among multi-ethnic postmenopausal women, with diabetes at risk for coronary heart disease; have developed a number of diabetes-specific psychosocial assessment instruments and social learning intervention strategies to increase healthy lifestyle practices, particularly in the areas of physical activity and diet; and an extensive publication record with expertise in areas of Health Psychology/Behavior Medicine; Nutrition assessment and behavioral interventions for persons with chronic diseases; Structural Equation Modeling: and Comprehensive Lifestyle Self-Management programs.

Dr. Toobert is the only known source to the NCI Researcher who possesses the skills and expertise in the areas outline above.  Dr. Toobert is an internationally recognized expert in her field. Her expertise and familiarity with the project content and her relevant research funded as part of the Behavior Change Consortium, and the Health Maintenance Consortium provide extensive historical knowledge and expertise working with the research data and with key experts (e.g. R. E. Glasgow, PhD) that allow her to effectively bridge appropriate content experts to the topic at hand.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Hormonal and Reproductive Branch (HRB), plans to procure on a sole source basis, for a Comparison of Sex-Hormone Levels in Breast Adipose Tissue and Serum Collected in the Polish Case-Control Study from the University of Southern California, Keck School of Medicine, Women?s & Children?s Hospital, 1240 N. Mission Road., Room 1M2, Los Angeles, CA 90033.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M.

The Hormonal and Reproductive Branch (HRB) conducts research to understand the role of hormones in causing cancer.  Research on the hormonal etiology of breast cancer has been an important long-term focus.  Sex-hormones play a critical etiologic role in the development of breast cancer. Limited data suggest that steroid hormone levels in breast tumors, non-neoplastic breast tissue, mammary fat and plasma are discordant. Furthermore, whereas serum hormone levels are higher among pre- as opposed to post-menopausal women, concentrations in breast tissues may be more comparable.  Accordingly, we hypothesize that breast tissue levels reflects biosynthesis, catabolism and uptake of circulating hormones within the breast; that concentrations may differ in breast tissue and serum; and that the intra-mammary levels are more tightly linked to cancer risk. Accordingly, understanding intra-mammary hormone metabolism is likely to be important for understanding breast cancer etiology and considering prevention strategies. 

 Our inability to define associations between tissue hormone levels and breast cancer risk is attributable to methodologic problems related to measurement and the lack of properly prepared informative samples.  Breast tissue contains varying amounts of epithelium, stroma and fatty tissue, making the content of pulverized specimens difficult to characterize. In addition, cross-reactivity between hormones has been problematic for laboratory assays. Because of its relative cellular homogeneity compared to non-fatty breast tissue, its accessibility, and its recognized importance in hormone production, we propose to measure hormones in mammary adipose tissue obtained during surgical removal of breast cancers.

In collaboration with the M. Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and the Institute of Oncology in Warsaw and the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Lodz, the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) of the NCI has conducted a population-based case-control study in Poland.  The study enrolled approximately 2,386 breast cancer cases and 2,502 controls.  A wealth of data has been amassed through questionnaire administration, anthropometric measurement, physical activity monitoring, and collection of blood, buccal cell, urine, and tissue specimens, including flash frozen mammary fat, tumor, and non-fatty tumor tissue. An important goal of the Polish study is to use a rich specimen resource to understand the role of hormones in breast cancer. 

Samples of frozen mammary fat were obtained from a total of 314 women in this study, of whom, 233 (74%) also provided breast tumor specimens and blood.   Of these, 166 were postmenopausal at the time of surgery.  We propose to measure steroid hormones in blood and mammary fat from 96 postmenopausal breast cancer cases, including 64 diagnosed with ER+/PR+ tumors and 32 with ER-/PR- tumors.  In addition we will select bloods from an additional 96 control women, frequency matched to the cases on menopausal status and age within 5 years for steroid hormone assessment.  The objective of this study is to measure and compare levels of estrogens and androgens in serum and frozen breast adipose tissue obtained from breast cancer cases participating in the Polish breast cancer case-control study, and to compare these to circulating hormones in cancer free controls.  

The University of Southern California is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort because they have conducted a proof-of-performance study under a previous contract with NCI to refine the extraction procedures on mammary fat and to assess the reproducibility of hormone measurements on the resulting extracts. This work was performed as part of a non-competitive contract (MQ417988).  They are considered a leader in measuring hormones in biological samples and have been performing pioneering work on developing and validating methods for measuring hormones in complex biological specimens such as human tissue.  The results of our pilot study are very encouraging, with the laboratory successfully measuring estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), androstenedione (A4) and testosterone (T) in frozen mammary fat tissues.  The coefficients of variation (CV) ranged from 5%-17% and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) ranged between 80%-94%.  This collaboration provides a strong basis for extending this work to serum and breast adipose samples from the Polish study of breast cancer.  This important research would use a unique, irreplaceable set of specimens.  Accordingly, it is vital to perform this research using validated methods. The University of Southern California has developed such methods and has the necessary staff to perform the very laborious and difficult fat extraction required to perform the fat tissue measurements.  

To achieve the objectives of this study, the University of Southern California will assess and compare hormone levels in serum and breast fat in samples from breast cancer cases according to age and tumor pathology characteristics, such as histology, grade, tumor size, number of positive nodes and hormone receptor status. They will also assess levels according to expression of numerous hormonal markers previously determined by immunostains performed on tissue microarrays include receptors (estrogen, progesterone, androgen), aromatase, steroid sulfatase, and other markers related to hormone levels or actions.  They will also assess and compare serum hormone levels in cases and controls.  This will be conducted by (1) Assaying serum for the following hormones:  E1, E1 SO4, E2, T, A4 and SHBG.  Serum from 96 cases, 96 controls and 20 quality control samples shall be aliquotted, batched and shipped to the contractor; and (2) Performing extraction of frozen mammary fat from 96 cases and 10 quality control samples and measure E2, E1, T and A4 in the resulting extracts.  Samples of flash frozen mammary fat will be shipped to the contractor.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Coordinating Center for Clinical Trials(CCT) intends to procure on a sole-source basis with the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill  104 Airport Drive, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 and The University of Chicago (UC), 970 East 58th Street, Chicago, IL 60637 for the services of Dr. Joel Tepper (UNC) to serve as Chairperson for the Scientific Steering Committees (SSC) and  Dr. Mark Ratain (UC) to serve as Chairperson for  the Investigational Drug Steering Committee (IDSC).  The Clinical Trials Working Group (CTWG) was established in January 2004, by the NCI Director to provid recommendations on the restructuring of all clinical research trials supported by NCI. The initiatives of the CTWG were approved by the National Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB) in June of 2005. The goal is to create an efficient, cost effective, science-driven and transparent process that will identify and promote the "Best Science" in clinical research and provide incentives to those who participate in a new, more collaborative system. One of the initiatives of the CTWG is to establish scientific steering committees (SSC) to address, design and prioritize phase 3 trials.  Another initiative is to establish an Investigational Drug Steering Committee (IDSC) for the design and prioritization of early phase drug development trials with agents for which CTEP hold an IND.  To achieve these goals, input is required from academic clinical scientists, basic and translational investigators, community oncologists, and patient advocate groups who are participating in clinical research trials or who will ultimately influence clinical research.   A chairperson is required by the NCI to provide overall leadership to the SSC and to Task Forces that serve the SSC especially in the area of drug development, experimental therapeutics and medical oncology. At the end of the project an efficient, cost effective, science-driven and transparent process that will identify and promote the "Best Science" in clinical research is expected to be in operation.  Drs. Tepper and Ratain were selected by peers in their fields based on specific skills, accomplishments and leadership qualities to meet the project's goals as required by NCI.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>SUBJECT: NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT TO SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL (SAIC) FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENTS The Government intends to issue this award on a sole source basis under FAR Part  6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A)(B  Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The objective of this work effort is for the contractor to conduct Environmental Review Guide for Operations (ERGO) Cycle IV environmental compliance assessments and prepare corresponding ERGO Assessment Reports for four (4) flood control basins in Califor nia. The assessment shall include all operations (including lessees and concessionaires) at San Antonio, Carbon Canyon, Fullerton, and Brea Dam Flood Control Basins. The Environmental Review Guide for Operations (ERGO) Supplement to The Environmental Assessment and Management (TEAM) Guide applies to all U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Civil Works activities, operating projects, and floating plants.  The ERGO Suppl ement is concerned with environmental compliance, not restoration activities.  Supplements to the TEAM Guide have also been developed for military programs.  The ERGO Supplement is designed as a reference for office and field managers to use along with the  appropriate technical experts and the Office of Counsel to determine if USACE activities are being conducted in compliance with Federal environmental laws and regulations.  It can also be used as a formal environmental audit program. This procurement involves a follow-on contract to MIPR W8IEYN42396696 (FY05) and Delivery Order 0055, contract number DACA63-97-0041 (FY04), which involved extensive development of reporting and inspection activities based on requirements set forth in the Environmental Assessment and Management (TEAM) Guide, the Environmental Review Guide for Operations (ERGO) Manual along with the California Supplement to the TEAM Guide, and the California Air Districts Supplement to the TEAM Guide and the California Air D istricts.

The casks and liners were designed and approved for CNS, now operated by Duratek, Inc.  The material is not to be repackaged.  It is for the storage of the 15 cask liners.  The important thing for any company thinking about bidding is that the waste inside the cask liners is classified as Greater Than Class C (GTCC).  EPA believes there is no facility in the U.S. that may accept the GTCC waste for disposal.  Therefore, it has to be stored.

<CONTACT>Lois Dyduck, Contracting Officer, Phone 215 737-3834, Fax 215 737-4115, Email Lois.Dyduck@dla.mil
<DESC>The Unitized Group Ration-A(UGR-A) is a ration consisting of the semi-perishable and perishable foods and disposable items(e.g., cups, trays, trash bags) necessary to feed fifty individuals during peacetime training, as well as mobilization operations.  The meal modules consist of a semi-perishable module (2 cases) containing the semi-perishable food components and disposable items, and the frozen perishable module (1 case), which are delivered concurrently.  A minimum shelf life of three (3) months shall be remaining at time of CONUS requirements.  OCONUS requirements, which are FOB Origin acceptance, require 9-month shelf life at time of receipt.  The UGR-A consists of 21 menus (7 breakfasts, 14 lunch/dinner.)  The components are readily available commercial items.  The purpose of the UGR-A program is to maximize and expedite the Services ability to provide high quality food service meals using using commercial, readily available food items(A Rations) to military personnel during worldwide operations.  The UGR-A Ration objectives include (i) simplify and streamline the customers ordering process by establishing two stock numbers to order a complete meal in lieu of multiple menu components, (ii) simplify and streamline the distribution/food handling process in the field by consolidating and clearly identifying the complete components of a single meal; (iii) eliminate inventory carrying costs by utilizing direct vendor deliveries(DVD) to customers on an as needed basis; and (iv) result in overall cost savings in the total food supply chain.  CONUS meals are not intended to be stocked by the Services and direct vendor delivery to all customers will be utilized.  OCONUS rations may be stored in Prime Vendor facilities in such locations as Korea, Kuwait, Dubai and Kabul or delivered DVD for customers in Germany, Puerto Rico and Honduras.  OCONUS deliveries are made FOB Origin by contractors, and shipped overseas via Defense Distribution Center.  This acquisition will provide complete ration modules for each menu, for 19 CONUS and 15 OCONUS installations.  The solicitation will include actual order history for each of the 19 installations for FY05.  An IQC minimum of 20% of the entire contract estimate, will be utilized.  This level provides greater flexibility to the Government and allows it to utilize other suppliers, in the event of unacceptable performance, without the execution of a default termination.  An IQC maximum of 300% is used to assure contract coverage in the event of large scale training or other contingencies.  Estimated quantities for the 14 month base period and  2-two year Option periods, respectively, are:  38,321 modules and 76,642 modules for each Option period.  Complete commercial item descriptions for each item in each menu were developed by DSCP, Natick and ACES and have been approved by authorized military food service representatives.  The UGR-A ration and specifications are totally commercial.  Utilizing Best Value/Trade-off source selection procedures, this solicitation will indicate that technical merit is more important than price.  It is the Governments intention to make an award to the offerors who indicate the overall best value utilizing the trade off process between price and non-price factors.

<SUBJECT>A -- Improve Floating Heavy Oil Collection and Recovery Technologies
<SOLNBR>HSCG32-06-I-R00032
<RESPDATE>093006
<ARCHDATE>10152006
<CONTACT>Helen Nelson, Administrative Assistant, Phone 860-441-2843, Fax 860-441-2888, Email helen.r.nelson@uscg.mil
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD (USCG) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER (RDC) IN GROTON, CT.  This Request For Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the USCG's needs.  The USCG RDC is chartered to conduct research, development, testing and evaluation activities.  The USCG RDC is seeking sources capable of providing systems to improve floating heavy oil collection and recovery technologies in the areas described below.  

1) Pumps - Although annular water injection (AWI) systems have increased the capacity of commonly used pumps, further research is needed in the realm of minimizing the amount of water injected or mixed with recovered oil, and addressing "worst case"  scenarios of reinitiating flow after pump stoppages.  The following areas need improvement for pumping viscous oil: a) Develop additional AWI system settings to assist in the start of long distance pumping and initiation of the annular flow process; b) Develop methods for the clearing of clogged hose; c) Develop methods to reinitialize annular flow in long distance hoses after a temporary shut-down (content may settle and possibly cool in cold or freezing conditions); and, d) Develop methods to remove lubricating water before it is discharged into storage.  

2) Containment Strategies and Equipment - In previous work to develop new containment devices, light oil was used in modeling the process.  Recommendations are sought on how to bridge from light to heavy oil, including simple containment testing using heavy oils and lighter oils to gauge the differences in performance based on viscosity.  Equipment designs or modifications that take advantage of the properties of heavy oil are also sought.  For example, booms with netting as part of the skirt may perform well as the netting would allow some water to pass but retard the flow of oil.  Areas that need improvement include: a) Develop operating characteristics for containment boom using both dense and light oils with over a wide viscosity range to determine the influence on containment and identify failure modes, and b) Evaluate and develop methods to improve containment such as rope snares in conjunction with "typical" standard and sorbent booms.

3) Skimmers - Weir skimmers, which are commonly used for spill response in a range of oil types, usually perform poorly in heavy oil unless the layer is sufficiently thick to overcome the oil's resistance to flow.  Belt and brush skimmers have proven effective at recovering heavy, viscous oils and multiple manufacturers are adapting modifications to the most popular weir skimmers to make them more effective, too.  Further study needs include: a) Determine how to maintain the performance of modified weir skimmers loaded with heavy oil, under a range of operating conditions, to determine the impact of skimmer buoyancy and oil weight; and b) Ways to improve the performance of viscous oil adapters/modifications and stock weir skimmers in waves when compared to other skimmers designed specifically for viscous oils.

4) Storage - One significant limiting factor for the success of heavy oil recovery is the storage of the oil during skimming operations.  Problems in handling and pumping heavy, viscous oil may limit the speed at which temporary storage can be offloaded, or even if the stored oil can be accessed because it may cool below its pour point.  Research needs include the following: a) Identify and test methods of localized heating to enable temporary storage to be offloaded, and b) Identify and test methods to speed the emptying of storage bladders (techniques such as lifting with a bridle in conjunction with a crane have been used, but simpler methods may be available) and c) Develop methods to separate water from oil in temporary and permanent storage.

NOTE: Actual proposals are not being solicited at this time for the above requirement. Statements addressing the above capability areas shall be limited to three (3) pages. The statements must include: A) Description of concept including: 1) an overview of the theory, the equipment needed to implement it, the operating method, and conditions of operation, 2) General approach to concept development including identifying off-the-shelf equipment and equipment to be developed; 3) timeline and rough order-of-magnitude costs; 4) Support needs from outside resources (e.g., vessel, aircraft, electrical power, etc.), and 5) Any knowledge of previous experience/attempts at this approach and references; B) Any proposed testing methods; and C) Any partners D) Any direct or indirect experience with these issues.

<SUBJECT>A -- Emergency Assessment and Recovery of Non-floating Oils

<CONTACT>Helen Nelson, Administrative Assistant, Phone 860-441-2843, Fax 860-441-2888, Email helen.r.nelson@uscg.mil
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD (USCG) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER (RDC) IN GROTON, CT.  This Request For Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the USCG's needs.  The USCG RDC is chartered to conduct research, development, testing and evaluation activities.  The USCG RDC is seeking sources capable of providing systems to improve emergency assessment and recovery actions in response to spills of nonfloating oils. These actions are divided into five phases, as outlined below. All potential systems have to be able to address these requirements, as appropriate:  a) rapid mobilization to the oil spill site; b) rapid data turnaround (hours to 1 day); c) performance under poor water visibility conditions; and d) ability to work under widely varying conditions of oil thickness, distribution and environmental conditions. 

1) Detection of Oil Suspended in the Water Column - Depending on the oil density and currents, nonfloating oil can suspend in the water column and be transported long distances by riverine and tidal currents. Response capability needs include detecting the presence of oil suspended as droplets varying in size from 0.1 mm to 10 cm, identifying where in the water column the oil is suspended, determining distribution of relative concentrations and detecting oil in both clear and turbid water. Lower detection limits are important to document because of varying thresholds of concern, depending on spill conditions. Methods should be able to discriminate against other contaminants that may cause false positives.  Airborne sensors are of particular interest because of their rapid and synoptic data collection capabilities; however, vessel-deployed systems are also sought.

2) Detection of Oil on the Bottom - Systems to improve mapping of sunken oil on the seafloor are sought in the following  areas:  a) Underwater video systems - Improved performance under poor visibility conditions, deployment configurations to optimize data collection, and automated data processing methods to interpret the results and quantify the amount of oil present; b) Acoustic systems - A systematic assessment of acoustic systems is needed to identify the conditions under which they are likely to be effective for detection of submerged oil on the bottom, and how the technology might be improved to increase their overall performance, including system configuration, operating conditions, and data processing methods to speed production of data products to support decision-making; c) Airborne remote sensing technologies that can penetrate the surface of the water - These systems have not been used at any spill of submerged oil because little is known about their potential effectiveness at detecting oil on the seafloor under different conditions of water depth, turbidity, bottom type, oil thickness and percent cover and d) Adapting above-water existing sensors to underwater deployment.  All approaches should address issues with integration in the deployment platforms, i.e. aircraft, vessel, submarine, etc.  

3) Containment of Suspended Oil/Protection of Water Intakes - Technologies are needed to contain, divert, or exclude oil suspended into the water column during a spill response. Similarly, improved technologies and engineering guidelines for deployment of systems that will protect water intakes (including powerplants, municipal water supplies, etc.) during spills where oil becomes suspended in the water column are sought. Site conditions often include water currents of 0.5-2 knots, water depths up to 50 feet, and offshore-based deployment. Methods used in past spills include filter fences and air bubble curtains, however, effectiveness has been limited. Information is sought on temporary systems that can be deployed on an emergency basis rather than permanently constructed systems at a facility.

4) Containment of Submerged Oil on the Bottom - The only successful containment of oil on the bottom has occurred naturally, where the oil accumulated in low-flow zones or existing depressions on its own. Thus, innovative ideas are sought on systems and deployment strategies to prevent the spread of oil on the bottom. Spreading occurs when the oil is remobilized by bottom currents, so system designs will have to consider water flow patterns around or through containment structures. Such strategies, where the sunken oil can or is moving, could be similar to the concept of using booms to divert floating oil to recovery devices. 

5) Recovery of Submerged Oil on the Bottom - Recovery of submerged oil on the bottom requires multiple systems for picking up the oil, separating the oil, water, and sediments, and treating the waste streams. Innovative solutions are sought for the following components of recovery operations:  a) Methods to increase the oil recovery rates of diver-directed pumping on the seafloor; these can include systems that would allow a diver to direct larger vacuum systems underwater, such as powered sleds that could handle larger hoses and have a mechanism to concentrate the oil towards the nozzle; b) Methods to reduce the amount of water intake during underwater pumping of viscous oils; c) Design of remotely operated recovery systems for conditions where diver-directed systems are not safe or efficient; d) Identification of types of existing dredges that would be most useful and what modifications can be quickly made to improve their performance, including innovative dredge head modifications; as with other pumping systems, a particular need is to develop methods to reduce the amount of water and sediment collected during dredging operations; and e) Guidelines and calculation tools that consider oil type, droplet size, flow rates, etc. to improve decanting systems

NOTE: Actual proposals are not being solicited at this time for the above requirement. Statements addressing the above capability areas shall be limited to three (3) pages. The statements must include: A) Description of concept including: 1) an overview of the theory, the equipment needed to implement it, the operating method, and conditions of operation, including addressing items a-c listed in the first paragraph of this document. 2) general approach to concept; development including identifying off-the-shelf equipment and equipment to be developed, 3) timeline and rough order-of-magnitude costs, 4) support needs from outside resources (e.g., vessel, aircraft, electrical power, etc.), and 5) any knowledge of previous experience/attempts at this approach and references; B) Any proposed testing methods; C) Any partners; D) Any direct or indirect experience with these issues.

                 EL =  100  *                  Scheduled Use Time (SUT)(hours)

<BR><BR>All times will be accrued in 15 minute increments and rounded up to the next highest number of hours when computing the monthly effectiveness level.  Further, if any period of Operation Use Time (OUT) of less than three hours duration is immediately preceded and followed by periods of Down Time, and the CR determines that those Down Times were related, that the period OUT will be considered as Down Time in computing the monthly effectiveness level (EL).  EL will be truncated to an integer number.  Times are defined as follows:
<BR><BR>             OUT: Scheduled Use Time (SUT) minus down Time.  Time, accumulated in complete 15 minute intervals, during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is considered available. 
<BR><BR>             SUT: Time during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is scheduled by the Government for operation use.  Scheduled and unscheduled time out are not included in SUT.
<BR><BR>             Scheduled Time Out (STO): time during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is unavailable for operational use.

<BR><BR>             Down Time:  Time during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is not available for operational use.  Down Time can only occur during Scheduled Use Time.  Down Time for one contractor maintained system/equipment may result in Down Time for additional contractor maintained system(s)/equipment(s) which depend on that system/equipment for continued operation.  A system/equipment will be considered unavailable for use during an entire 15 minute interval if it is unavailable of used during any portion of the interval.  Down Time shall be record by the Government representative in the System Maintenance Event Log for the MSRC. 

<BR><BR>The contractor shall maintain equipment under the contract at a monthly effectiveness level of 98%, at a minimum, for each system/equipment identified.  If the effectiveness level for a system/equipment drops below 98%, the contractor shall grant a 100% maintenance credit.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-Picatinny, Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce in support of the U.S. Army Research Development Engineering Command   Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (RDECOM-ARDEC) is  conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources for the following: Transportable Infrasonic Sound Source.  Proposals are requested for technology  in infrasonic sound reproduction for long-range propagation studies in rural  and dense urban environments.  Potential sources include, but are not limited  to, classic speaker arrays, mechanical drive systems, hydraulics, linear  motors, fluidics, pyrotechnics, and flow modulators.  The infrasonic source  should have the following characteristics:  a)Achieve a sound pressure level (SPL) of 92-102 dB relative to 20 micro- Pascals at 250 meters across the operating frequency range, b)An operating frequency range of 14-20 Hz, c)A total harmonic distortion (THD) less than 1%.  The THD is defined here as  the sum of the squared amplitudes of the harmonics (i.e., the undesired  spectral content typically at multiples of the fundamental) divided by the  squared amplitude of the fundamental (i.e., the desired carrier frequency),  d)Achieve phase transitions within 50 milliseconds.   The self-contained system should be capable of continuous (24 hours a day,  every day) outdoor operation using sinusoidal or pseudo-stationary sinusoidal  inputs within the bandwidth at 100% duty cycle.  They system can have a  graceful degradation of measured sound pressure level at a rate of 6 dB per  month, assuming minimum maintenance or component repair/replacement can restore  the system to original performance levels.  The system should also be  transportable, with a size limitation goal of less than a standard ISO shelter  of dimensions 8x8x20.  Proposals should include projected performance, size,  weight, and power specifications.  Availability of replacement parts and ease  of serviceability are important.   Research into areas either directly addressing infrasonic propagation modeling  or supporting technologies will be considered. Offerors are urged to only  consider submitting proposals under this announcement if they have proven  experience in the area of sound reproduction systems or infrasonic source  technologies. Please identify any proprietary information submitted. Technical Point of Contact:   Mr. Jeffrey R. Heberley, e-mail:  heberley@pica.army.mil, (973) 724-6255 This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, does not  constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a  commitment by the U.S. Government. If a formal solicitation is generated at a  later date, a solicitation notice will be published. No award will be made as a  result of this market survey. All information is to be submitted at no cost or  obligation to the Government. The Government is not obligated to notify  respondents of the results of this survey.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information and Request for Telemetry Roundtable Participants
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  The Government does not intend to award a contract or any other type of agreement on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this synopsis.  This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation for bid.  The intent of this request for information is to obtain market research.  Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis.  The Government is interested in obtaining information from industry to identify organizations that are capable of providing technology for future flight test telemetry systems and who can participate in a discussion on the feasibility of meeting some future requirements.  As air vehicle design has become more sophisticated, telemetry data transmission requirements have increased and continue to increase exponentially, which leads to a continuing need for more radio spectrum to support these requirements. However, many other services also need to use more spectrum and this has led to losses of spectrum dedicated for flight telemetry use in the U.S. and larger, even complete, loss of such spectrum elsewhere. In order to mitigate the effects of such spectrum losses and assure the availability of needed spectrum globally, Agenda Item 1.5 of the 2007 World Radiocommunication Conference proposes to identify additional bands in the 3-30 GHz range for use by aeronautical telemetry for flight testing. Currently, three bands in the 4.4-6.7 GHz range are being considered under this agenda item. One of the major advantages of obtaining international spectrum allocations for aeronautical telemetry would be the ability to use the same technology everywhere and thus realize economy of scale and confidence that anyone could safely invest in the technology.  However, current efforts are to identify bands as appropriate for use by aeronautical telemetry, to be shared with other applications without priority.  Further, individual countries would be free to select the spectrum that would be used by telemetry and the use of regional designations has been discussed.  Now in order to realize the full potential of this agenda item, it is desirable to be able to identify common technologies that could operate over the full frequency range that is under consideration.  Availability of transmitter equipment and components that meet power and form factor requirements for telemetry equipment is particularly critical. We therefore need to see whether it is possible to implement common technologies over all the bands between 4.4 GHz and 6.7 GHz which are now under consideration.

In order to determine whether common technologies are available, the Test and Evaluation (T&E) Science and Technology (S&T) program manager will host a roundtable discussion at the 2006 International Telemetering Conference (ITC) on October 24 in San Diego, California and is seeking to identify organizations that can contribute to this discussion.  Organizations that are involved in technology development and/or production of transmitters, amplifiers, antennas, or other components that operate in these bands that wish to participate in this roundtable discussion are invited to respond to this request for information.  Organizations may also submit a written response, if unable to attend ITC.  Electronic responses are acceptable.  Responses shall be due no later than November 15, 2006.  Any company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked.  The information provided through the responses will be used to aid in requirements definition for future acquisitions.

<SUBJECT>A -- Follow-up of Patients Enrolled in the Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions (COMBINE) Study
<DESC>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to conduct a second follow-up study of subjects who were previously enrolled in a multi-site randomized clinical trial (RCT) of combined medication and behavioral therapy for alcoholism.  

RTI is the one responsible source that can satisfy the Agencys requirement because (1) RTI is the sole owner of critical previously collected data on human subjects, (2)
has extensive experience necessary to conduct the study proposed  for the current contract; and  (3) no other source can supply the services and data that will satisfy agency requirements for the follow-on work for this study.

Development of the original study, called Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions (COMBINE), was initiated in 1998 and supported by NIAAA under a co-operative agreement.  Data collection was begun in 2001.  In COMBINE, 1383 subjects were randomized to medications: one, both or neither (placebo) naltrexone or acamprosate combined.  In addition to the medication subjects were assigned to either (a) a 16-week behavioral therapy or (b) no behavioral therapy.  Eleven recruitment/ treatment sites and one co-coordinating center participated in COMBINE.  Extensive information was collected on subjects, including data from numerous questionnaires over several time points, tissue samples and genetic analyses.  Staff from the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) participated in development of data collection instruments.
 
A 5-year grant for a follow-up study (Cost Effectiveness of Alcohol Treatment) was awarded to RTI in 2002.  Eight hundred thirty-five subjects and 9 of the 11 original study sites participated in this, the first COMBINE follow-up study.  Follow-up data but no treatments were administered under this study.  A series of in-person interviews were conducted at the 9 participating sites.  Data collection for this study will conclude in the fall of 2006.  Most participants at the 9 sites provided informed consent to (a) be interviewed and (b) have their data from the COMBINE study, with identifiers, linked to data collected under the first-follow-up study.  Under the grant mechanism, these data belong to the grantee, RTI.  In addition to these data, the study maintained records of subject location information and one or two personal contacts useful for tracing subjects who moved and/or changed phone numbers.  

For cost and efficiency purposes, NIAAA plans to conduct the second COMBINE follow-up study using a single contractor (RTI) and telephone interviews.  The contractor will help design and gain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of the study.  Confidential contact information, already maintained through the RTI grant, will be used to track currently-enrolled subjects.  Subjects will be provided with details of the new follow-up study and asked to provide informed consent for the new study.  Four half-hour telephone interviews, planned at yearly intervals, will be administered to consenting subjects.  Development of the interviews will be done by personnel familiar with the COMBINE and first follow-up instruments.  As in the first follow-up study, subjects will be asked for their consent to link the data from COMBINE and the first follow-up studies with the second follow-up study.  These procedures require that the contractor have access to confidential identifiers and other data.  

Substantial data (including participants confidentially provided data and list of contacts) which is required to conduct the current study is owned by RTI.  Furthermore, participants confidential information may not be passed on to another research organization without prior consent of each participant.  As RTI has the unique resources to provide the particular research services proposed, a sole source contract to RTI is the only means to conduct the second follow-up phase as described.  

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, the Research Triangle Institute is the only source capable of performing this requirement due their ownership of the data and prerequisite knowledge and experience because of their work under the Cooperative Agreement and performing as the grantee for the COMBINE study under the NIAAA Grant.   

To begin anew with a different source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delays in obtaining the required data.   

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements as described above.  A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposal, nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Note 22.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Network Appliance R200 8TB expansion shelf. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State Automated Data Processing requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The IRM ESOC purchased a Network Appliance R200 filer back in May to allow other Bureaus to mirror their critical data. All the ESOC required is that the Bureaus purchase their own disk space. EUR-IO/EX requires an 8 Terabyte expansion shelf with the Snapmirror license and support services to mirror its domestic and overseas data to ESOC-BIMC As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The Network Appliance R200 has undergone tests, assessment, and evaluation for use in the IRM Enterprise Server Operations Center (ESOC) to house Department of State critical data backups and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. In order for EUR-IO/EX to make use of this appliance by purchasing additional disk space.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Network Appliance R200 8TB expansion shelf.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State Automated Data Processing requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The IRM ESOC purchased a Network Appliance R200 filer back in May to allow other Bureaus to mirror their critical data.  All the ESOC required is that the Bureaus purchase their own disk space.  EUR-IO/EX requires an 8 Terabyte expansion shelf with the Snapmirror license and support services to mirror its domestic and overseas data to ESOC-BIMC  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The Network Appliance R200 has undergone tests, assessment, and evaluation for use in the IRM Enterprise Server Operations Center (ESOC) to house Department of State critical data backups and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.  In order for EUR-IO/EX to make use of this appliance by purchasing additional disk space.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

?Expanded Affiliated Group? means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(End of provision) 
 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
Instrument to Be Purchased:  A 213-nm Nd:YAG laser ablation system for an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer that can also be used with a mass spectrometer for research and routine testing of a broad range of Library collection materials, collection housing materials, and collection environments for trace levels of elements.
 
B.  Anticipated Delivery Date and Location of Delivery: The vendor must provide the instrument within 56-70 days of either a faxed or written PO to LM-G52 via delivery truck with no larger than a 24-foot bed.

C.  Acceptance Process:  The instrument will be accepted only after it is fully installed on site and is started-up by a vendor-certified engineer, after it is shown to meet all performance and any other specifications, and after all training is provided for a user.  If the instrument fails to meet all performance specifications, it will be returned to the manufacturer at the manufacturer?s expense.  

D.  Performance Requirements:
The 213-nm Nd:YAG laser ablation system for an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) and a mass spectrometer (MS) must meet all of the following performance requirements: 

1.	It must be a dedicated, deep UV, internally homogenized 213-nm Nd:YAG laser that can provide 1) high absorption for UV transparent materials (> 80% for calcite), 2) fine particle size distribution of ablated material (all particles < 0.5?m), 3) high sample transport efficiency with helium as a cell gas (> 200% increase of signal), 4) low depth of penetration (to < 0.1?m/shot) for high depth-spatial resolution, and 5) an ablation spot size down to 4 microns.
2.	It must have a hybrid-resonator with energy output via a motorized, software-controlled optical attenuator to deliver variable amounts of energy (maximum of at least 27 J/cm2) measured at the sample by a built-in energy meter that can be monitored in real time.
3.	It must have a safety system that is an Open Architecture Class 1 shield plus interlocks to accommodate large format and specialty sample cells and permit direct viewing of the sample during ablation.
4.	It must have 1) a software-controlled gear-driven aperture wheel to control the beam size with constant energy density to provide spot sizes ranging from 4-110 microns, and 2) a beam expander to control beam size with varying energy density to allow automated switching between focused beam and aperture imaging modes.
5.	The sample stage must have 0.20-?m resolution and travel up to 52 mm in both the x and y planes with calibration in the x, y, and z directions.
6.	The sample chamber must be cassette style and measure at least 60 mm ID x 52 mm inside height for thin sections, thick sections, irregular specimens and standards.
7.	The sample cells must include a paper/wafer cell and a minimum-volume low-flow sample cell.
8.	It must include a color CCD camera and frame grabber that is software controlled with magnification 5.6 to 36X optical and 180X to 1200X image magnification to provide optical resolution of at least 2 ?m.
9.	The laser ablation software must be able to operate with an OES or MS computer and monitor and bi-directional control between the laser system and the OES or MS data collection software via TTL/CMOS compatible signal voltages or switch relay closures.
10.	Real-time sample viewing during ablation must be possible so that easy targeting of sample micro-features is possible using cross-hair positioning with software control of three light sources with variable intensity.

E.	Final Competitive Award Criteria:  If instruments from multiple vendors were to meet all the above performance requirements, two final evaluation criteria would be required:
 
1.	We would submit a pre-determined set of blind samples to all vendors, have them perform identical experiments, and have them submit the data to us for our final evaluation of its analytical quality.  If the data were identical, then:
2.	We would perform our own hands-on evaluation of all instruments at the vendors? sites with all transportation, hotel accommodations, and per diem paid by the vendors.  The criteria for this evaluation would include, but not be limited to, ease of use of instrument, sophistication of software and data analysis, and a comparison of other performance criteria provided by the manufacturers.  Technical proposal will be based on highest performance rating based where price and cost factor will not be assigned a numerical weight or point score.  Proposal are due September 11, 2006.  Proposal received after the due date will not be accepted.  This is a full and open competitive procurement.  This solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-07 dated February 2, 2006.  Any question regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing to Arneen Dozier via email.  The Library reserves the right to award without discussions.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Library.

Background:  

The Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Advisory Committee, authorized by the No Child Left Behind Act, was appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings. The Committee was established to provide advice to the Secretary on Federal, state, and local programs designated to create safe and drug-free schools, and on issues related to crisis planning. As outlined in section 4124(a), the Committee will consult with, and provide advice to, the Secretary for the programs listed in section 4124(b) that are already carried out by the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools. The Advisory Committee is made up of representatives from Federal Agencies and private citizens who have high levels of expertise and experience in the areas of drug, alcohol and violence prevention; safe schools; mental health research and crisis planning.

The Advisory Committee will initially focus on three issues: the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities State Grants Program, the Unsafe School Choice Option, and requirements for data under No Child Left Behind. The Secretary asks the Advisory Committee to address a series of questions related to these three issues and submit a report by June 30, 2007 to the Secretary outlining its findings and any recommendations.

Performance Work Statement for Feasibility Study of Relocation/Replacement of Research Devices

Background

The Naval Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory (NAMRL) located in Pensacola Florida is being relocated to Wright Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), Ohio. NAMRL has two research devices known as the Coriolis Acceleration Platform (CAP) and the Human Disorientation Device (HDD). The research capability provided by these two devices needs to be retained when NAMRL relocates to WPAFB.

A feasibility study is necessary to determine whether moving the CAP and HDD to WPAFB or building new devices at the new location is the more economically sensible approach. To accomplish this three cost estimates are needed. One estimate will be for the disassembly, packaging, moving, and installation of each device. The second cost estimate will be for the design, fabrication, and installation of each new equivalent device intended to replace each of the two existing devices. The third estimate will be for the design, fabrication, and installation of a single new device that is capable of replacing the two existing devices. The ultimate goal is to determine the most cost effective and technologically feasible means of relocating/replacing the HDD and CAP.

Estimate I: Relocation of CAP and HDD

Complete the following tasks: 
Operate the devices to determine what systems are operational and what, if any, are not.
Evaluate each sub-section of the devices to determine their remaining useful life.
Interface with US Navy and Air Force researchers to review and evaluate the capabilities and requirements for the devices.
Provide a cost estimate for the disassembly, packaging, moving, and installation of the CAP and HDD from NAMRL to WPAFB

Items to be considered during the study that will be required for the actual relocation of CAP and HDD include:
Items completed above as part of the cost estimate
Evaluate the portion of the existing building that contains the devices and create a complete set of CAD drawings (structural and electrical) of that portion of the building reflecting the device requirements. These drawings will then be incorporated into the design of the new building at WPAFB that will allow for the installation of the devices at its new location.
Disconnect all electrical connections and tag them with their appropriate voltage and current requirements.
Create an exterior opening (approx 20?x20?) in the existing building to allow for the removal of the basic truss structure and any other large components of the CAP. This opening must be closed at the completion of this effort such that it maintains structural integrity and matches existing architecture. A large roll-up door exists for the removal of large components of the HDD from the existing building.

Local Fort Lewis clauses 52.111-4131, Commercial Vehicle Access to Fort Lewis  Fast Access Gate Program, 52.111-4132, Identif ication of Contractors Employees  Fast Access Gate Program, and 52.111-4004, Electronic Commerce, apply to this acquisition.  Local clause 52.111-4131 states:  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior no tice.  Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Acce ss Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding fe deral holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays,  and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor sh ould anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concret e or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On we ekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5in clearance) will require a time stamped searched- label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched- labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5in in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a -searched- label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, i ncluding drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate .  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate P rogram is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier  Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only t hrough the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.- Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  -a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to pe rform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requi res access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Libert y) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if th e contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any s et-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the  FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however , if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an  identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot  be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government i nstallation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are i ssued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such l oss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall  wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).

FOB DESTINATION CONUS The use of brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure requirements, and continuity of current operations, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. 2.   A description of the supplies or services required meeting the agencys needs. RM/GFS/GS has identified the HP Hardware listed below as key components of the Departments Financial Management System.   	HP 10642 42 U Standard Rack Pallet (P/N 245161-B21) is required because of its size. The 10642 G2 rack is a 42U rack which is 42 U high, 600mm / 23.62 in (wide), and 1000mm / 39.37 in (deep).  It is essential that we purchase a rack with these measurements to maintain the continuity of the Operations Center; these dimensions are required for the racks to function properly with the Liebert XDV rack mounted air conditioning units installed in the data center. 	HP KVM CAT5-PS/2 console (P/N 262587-B21) is required it maintains continuity of existing hardware and can be easily exchanged within the operations and saves the department significant costs due to replacement of spare parts and extended warranties. 	HP 0x2x16 IP console switch (P/N 336045-B21) is required because it provides all of the following benefits: 1.	0U mounting (zero U - i.e. takes no space away from servers) 2.	Remote management via iLO (HP's proprietary Integrated Lights Out) 3.	Simplified cable management - CAT5 cables much smaller than typical KVM cables 4.	Supports tiering or cascading up to 256 servers 5.	Supports 2 simultaneous users 6.	Integration with HP IP Console switch - minimum reconfiguration needed if/when we switch to remote IP consoles 7.	All of the existing console switches are HP which helps simplify the repair process. This is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments Financial Management System.

A narrow bandwidth (such as 2 nm) is needed to enable accurate measurements of the desired wavelength, a capability which becomes particularly important in the UV-B spectral region. The sensors also should be cosine response corrected to enhance the radiometric performance. The optical component of the sensor should be specifically designed to eliminate spectral light leakage.  The sensor must be capable of 12 volt operation with full digital output.  Sensor must be enclosed in a corrosion proof Delrin type housing. The UV equipment is required to quantify the UV irradiance data at different locations (surface as well as underwater) over a period of time.  This sensor will be used in conjunction with a moored, battery-powered system on a buoy that will continuously measure and log downwelling and upwelling solar irradiance in the 350 to 700 nm region.  Satlantic hyperspectral sensors and a Satlantic STOR-X data logger will be used for conducting concurrent downwelling and upwelling light measurements on a buoy system.  It is necessary that the UV-B and UV-A sensors on the UV digital radiometer be designed to work with this equipment for measurement compatibility and instrument comparisons., 1, EA; <BR><BR>For this solicitation, Environmental Protection Agency intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc.

1.0	Background 

The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates a fleet of twenty-one (21) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are operated differently from general aviation; Coast Guard HU-25 missions frequently operate at lower altitudes and in salt-laden environments.  This environment accelerates corrosion on airframe structures and components of the aircraft.  The Coast Guard typically flies each of these aircraft 800 flight hours per year.  Aircraft are inspected in accordance with (IAW) the Original Equipment Manufacture?s (OEM) periodic requirements in conjunction with the Coast Guard?s specialized Aircraft Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  Historically, corrosion damage and operational wear and tear associated with aging aircraft is revealed, which is often outside the scope of OEM published repair limits and specifications.  All Coast Guard horizontal stabilizers are serial number tracked under ACMS.  This tracking provides a historical record of repair, item location and status.  It also provides an effective method of configuration control.  
2.0	Objective		
The Coast Guard?s objective is to obtain services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center or equivalent, to effectively repair HU-25 horizontal stabilizers, Part Numbers MY20331-16 and MY20331-17.  Repaired horizontal stabilizers must meet the OEM current specifications, critical profile and dimensions to ensure the fit to aircraft with minimal adjustment during installation.  The Coast Guard requires a Turn-Around-Time of 120 days from time of material receipt at prospective contractor facility in order to prevent Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) delay in aircraft delivery.  During repair, corrosion preventative steps shall be incorporated.  The horizontal stabilizer must also be painted to match the Coast Guard?s current colors and paint schemes. 
The Coast Guard anticipates at least two levels of repair for horizontal stabilizers.  First, a ?return-to-service repair? would be required for horizontals that are subject to limited damage, such as exterior corrosion or minor impact damage, inspection and replacement of bushings and hardware as required. This would require skin repair and hardware.  Second, ?extensive repair? would be required for horizontal stablizers that require replacement of skins, major extrusions, and fittings. At a minimum, these two levels of service should be addressed in the prospective contractor technical and price proposal.  Prospective contractor may propose additional levels of service.

These forms are considered deliverables under the contract.	Noncompliance with these instructions shall result in nonpayment of invoices. The contractor shall maintain a copy of each completed CRR for a minimum of ninety (90) days.
 	C.  Under a performance-based requirements contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract. The performance measures and metrics will be reviewed for the extent they are comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives, identify the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness, and will be tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics. The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the contractor will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.
D. Technical	
1.  Provide detailed work specifications for horizontal stabilizer ?return-to-service repair?, ?extensive repair? and any other proposed levels of repair.  
2. Horizontal stabilizers shall be painted using products that meet or exceed MIL-PRF-23377 epoxy primer and MIL-PRF-85285 polyurethane topcoats.  Aviation coatings which meet or exceed the performance and quality of these products may be substituted.
3. Horizontal stabilizers shall be painted to match the Coast Guard paint schemes, IAW ARSC Paint Drawing 925-139.
 NOTE: Color match is critical for this contract and future aircraft maintenance.  Coatings currently used by the Coast Guard are known to provide satisfactory results on aircraft operating in corrosive environments when properly applied.  
4. All products proposed for use shall be submitted with quote for performance and color match review and approval. 
5. ARSC currently applies AKZO Nobel Eclipse products to the HU-25 stabilizers.

b. White AKZO P/N: ECL-G-46
c. Orange AKZO P/N: ECL-G-3655
E. Service Bulletins

Service bulletins are subject to change during the contract period of performance.

All service bulletins if not previously accomplished, shall be identified to the Contracting Officer.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining service bulletins.   Upon receipt of components requiring incorporation of such service bulletins, the offeror shall prepare a firm fixed price proposal IAW instructions listed below.  Service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number configurations, which supersede the previous configuration.  In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number may be added to the contract.  The contractor shall notify and request disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer for superseded parts, which have been removed and replaced by new part number configurations.
Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the contractor shall submit, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notification, a firm-fixed price proposal for an incremental charge to be assessed each time the service bulletin is incorporated in a component.  The proposal shall contain a breakdown of material and labor costs including hours, labor categories, labor rates, and applicable mark ups.  The incremental charge agreed to for incorporation of a service bulletin shall apply only to those components into which the Offeror incorporates a required service bulletin, not those into which the service bulletin has been previously incorporated.  Upon agreement of an incremental charge and issuance of a contract modification to reflect this change, the service bulletin shall be incorporated into each subsequent component received at the repair facility if said service bulletin has not already been incorporated.  When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the contract.  The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is required.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 (b)(1).

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Project Magnitude:  Between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.

STATEMENT OF WORK 

1. SCOPE: The contractor shall provide all travel, plant, supervision, materials, design, and labor necessary to demolish 40 two-family housing units, located in the Bicentennial Military Family Housing area at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma. 

2. PRINCIPAL FEATURES: The work to be accomplished consists, in general, of the following principal items. This does not mean that the work consists only of these items. But, that it consists of these principal items along with all incidental minor work which becomes necessary to complete in order to accomplish the overall project in a satisfactory and workmanlike manner meeting the approval of the Contracting Officer. This incidental work is to be included in the Contractor proposal at the time of submittal to the Contracting Officer. 

a. Provide to the Contracting Officer prior to the commencement of work, any specific plans for actions not called for in this Statement of Work, specific differing procedures for actions called for already, and plans for removal of asbestos known to exist in the buildings to be demolished. Surveys for asbestos containing materials and lead-based paint are attached for the contractor use along with the Altus AFB standards for removal as part of a demolition project. Questions concerning Lead Based Paint or Asbestos in the units should be addressed to the 97th CES Environmental Flight. 

b. Assure that all utilities attached to the units are shut off prior to the start of the demolition work. Utility shutoff shall be coordinated between the contractor and the 97th Civil Engineering Squadron at Altus AFB. 

c. Demolish 40 duplex housing units located in Bicentennial Housing at Altus AFB, OK, some of which are two-story units. Demolition shall be accomplished using mechanical contrivances such as track-hoe, front end loader, bulldozer, or other similar equipment. Other acceptable practices are manual demolition by workmen, or mechanically assisted manual demolition. Under no circumstances may explosives be used for any part of the work. 

d. After demolition of the structure above the concrete slab foundations, the concrete slabs shall be demolished and hauled away. e. Contractor shall demolish and haul away all driveways leading to the units, as far as the sidewalks. If sidewalk is damaged in this process, it shall be replaced by the contractor as part of the work required by this project. 

e. The contractor shall have the option of salvaging any usable items from the structure prior to demolition. Examples of salvageable items may be light fixtures, water closets, lavatory sinks, cabinets, doors, etc. All salvaged items will become the property of the contractor. 

f. Prior to the general demolition, any required hazardous material remediation shall be accomplished. Any identified asbestos, lead-based paint, etc. shall be removed and properly disposed of before the bulk of demolition can proceed.  Test results for asbestos containing material (ACM) conducted 28 August 2006 were negative for all sheetrock, joint compound and flooring/mastic.  The only remediation required will be the short length of flue pipe on the mechanical units.  This transite pipe is to be removed, bagged and disposed of along with demolished material in a state approved landfill.

g. Before demolition of air-conditioning units, or their removal, all refrigerants shall be removed from the units and captured in approved containers which meet all local, state, and federal rules, regulations, laws, etc., regarding capture and disposal of refrigerants. Contractor shall be responsible for disposal of any such refrigerants removed as part of this project. 

h. Debris generated by the demolition shall be removed from the worksite by the contractor and disposed of off base in an environmentally sound manner. All debris shall be cleaned up and hauled away from the site to a state-approved landfill or recycling center. 

i. Haul route(s):  All commercial traffic shall enter the Base through the South Gate and exit the Main Gate. The exit from the project area shall be through the street that empties out of the south gate of Bicentennial Housing onto Old Veterans Drive near the school. Traffic would then turn left onto Burr Drive, crossing East and West River Drive, continuing on Birch Drive, continuing on to Altus Road, right on Altus Road to Falcon Road, and then right on Falcon Road, through the Main Gate, and off base. Entrance back onto Base will be through the South Gate, left on Ordnance Road to the traffic circle, down First Street to the traffic light, left on Birch Drive, to Burr Drive, to Old Veterans Drive, then right on Veterans and into the project area where the exit road is. Contractors are to expect minimal delays entering the air base due to heightened security.  Speed limits on the air base are 25 MPH unless posted otherwise.  The speed limit throughout the housing area is 15 MPH.

j. Capping of Utilities: Utilities shall be capped as follows: Sewer lines shall be capped at the wyes using plugs in the wyes, or the wyes removed and capped with a pipe cap. Water lines shall be capped with repair clamps at the mains. Gas shall be capped using sweated caps on copper lines, and PVC or matching caps on plastic lines. Electrical shall be removed up to the distribution transformer and disconnected at that point, and the conductor and conduit to the house removed. After underground utility lines are removed, the contractor shall backfill the trenches/holes made by this removal and compact the soil removed and replaced by use of walk-behind or other mechanical vibratory compactor. It is the intent of the government to have the sites cleared of all utilities to a depth of three feet up to the point of termination of utilities to remain. After backfill and compaction, the entire work area shall be leveled by use of a small grader or other such contrivance, to leave the area graded to match up with surrounding elevations and shall include any fine grading required to leave the finished area acceptable for the installation of sod while providing positive drainage to existing ditches, drains, etc. If imported fill dirt is required to maintain existing grade lines, the fill shall be provided by the contractor as part of the project and shall be free of foreign-debris and suitable for topsoil usage. 

k. After grading, the contractor shall establish new sod over all areas disturbed by the demolition. The contractor shall install sod over the entire cleared and graded area. Sodding shall be accomplished in accordance with the guidelines established in the publication, Guideline Specifications to Turfgrass Sodding, published by Turfgrass Producers International, 1855-A Hicks Road, Rolling Meadows, IL. Of special interest to the government is that when the turf is established after all demolition is completed, the final profile of the work area shall be level without significant bumps, ridges, knolls, or other general surface irregularities. Sod shall not be left with projecting corners or edges lapped over adjoining strips of sod. Sod shall be placed level and rolled or otherwise worked to provide a relatively even surface after it is fully established and growing. For growth establishment, the contractor will be allowed use of government provided water from existing water lines and/or fire hydrants in the area to irrigate the new turf until it is fully established. The contractor shall be responsible for providing adapters, connectors, piping, hoses, and sprinklers necessary to irrigate the grass. 

l. The existing rented chain-link fencing around Bicentennial Housing shall remain in place for the duration of the demolition contract. The contractor may mount signs or other materials on the fence temporarily, but must remove any such items from the fence upon completion of his work. The fence gates used for access into and out of the demolition area shall be secured at the end of each workday to assure that children or other potential trespassers will not have access to the area. The demolition contractor is hereby notified that the government does not own this fence, and any damage to the fence caused by demolition activities will be the responsibility of the contractor to repair or pay the owner of the fence for repair or replacement. At his own option and expense, the demolition contractor may erect additional fencing for whatever reason he may deem necessary or may ask that the temporary fencing be removed so that he may provide his own construction fence. Any fencing, gates, or accessories installed as part of this contract shall be removed upon acceptable completion of the work and all holes/disturbed areas returned to their previous conditions. 

m. The contractor shall refer to UFGS 01572 Construction and Demolition Waste Management as the guide for requirements concerning recycling, reuse, and disposal of demolished or dismantled materials and equipment, and reporting on disposition of these items. Adherence to the requirements of UFGS 01572 in all its sections and subsections shall be considered as part of this project. The contractor may refer any and all questions pertaining to this specification to the Environmental Flight of 97th CES.

3. SPECIAL SCHEDULING: The demolition shall be so scheduled as to assure that the area encompassing Liberty Circle will be worked first. Demolition in this area must be completed first in order to allow for planned construction by the new Military Family Housing privatization contractor. It is highly recommended that sod operations begin as soon as an area is completed to allow for new sod to become established.
