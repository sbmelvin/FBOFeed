<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, has a requirement for the study, evaluation, review, technical investigation and analysis of current and emerging knowledge and technology in selected areas of food processing, food safety, food security, and human health issues.  Three kinds of analysis/reviews shall be requested under the terms of this contract:  Comprehensive Reviews, Abbreviated Reviews, and Technical Investigation and Analysis for Potential Solutions.  The successful contractor shall be responsible for providing comprehensive reviews in the subject scientific areas and shall emphasize the essential components of an independent scientific review and evaluation.  The approach selected to address the topics identified by FDA for each Comprehensive Review shall emphasize the essential components of an independent scientific review and evaluation.  Every effort shall be made to minimize bias in the review of scientific information.  The final reports shall carefully document divergent scientific opinions.  The contractor shall prepare, within sixty days of initiation of each Comprehensive Review, a detailed Scientific Plan that describes a reasonable approach to address the scientific questions posed by FDA.   This plan shall take into account the complexities of the issues raised.   A project schedule shall be included in the Plan to indicate how the contractor shall organize the work to be performed for each Comprehensive Review.   In addition some abbreviated reviews are anticipated requiring rapid response and analysis and summaries of emerging issues in selected topics.       Abbreviated Reviews are intended to provide FDA with rapid analysis and summaries of emerging issues in the areas of food safety and health; they are normally completed within one to six months.   Requests for Abbreviated Reviews of selected topics shall be interspersed during the life of the contract.     The contractor shall prepare a written report summarizing the review and the conclusions or recommendations reached.   The basic types of Abbreviated Review activities that may be requested by FDA:   “Quick Response Actions on Request” shall address specific scientific issues such as the scientific merit of research proposals, new research, food processing and technological developments, and food safety and security concerns.  Predictive Response shall provide perspectives on issues in the field of food safety and security for approaching scientific areas of science evaluation, which are relevant to FDA’s mission.  Technical investigation and analysis of potential solutions to specific food safety or food security issues shall be requested under the terms of this contract.  These investigations involve a review of the food processing systems and activities and determination and validation of the preventive measures that can be applied by industry, particularly small and medium business, to eliminate or minimize a food safety hazard or food security vulnerability.  The contractor must have state-of-the-art knowledge on relevant scientific issues relating to food processing, food safety, food security, and human health.  The contractor must have a multidisciplinary scientific based organization that has experience and sufficient scientific expertise necessary to conduct research in the areas mentioned above.  It is anticipated that this requirement will result in an ID/IQ multi-year contract with task orders.  Many of the resulting task orders may be for research relating to bio-terrorism and or counter terrorism issues.  Because of the security issues involved in conducting this type of research it will be necessary to classify these projects as secret or top-secret.  It should be noted that any offeror interested in this procurement must possess the ability to obtain the necessary security clearances if they receive the contract.  The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.  Technical questions may be sent to the Contract Specialist, e-mail address or fax number contained herein, until fifteen (15) days after issuance of the RFP.  No responses to questions will be given after that date. (See Numbered Note 1)

<DESC>UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE<p>
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION – 2BRPSR-04-A-1408<p>
STAMPS ON CONSIGNMENT PROGRAM SUPPORT<p>
<p>

Request for Information Process
<p>
The United States Postal Service (Postal Service) desires to engage in discussions with qualified companies interested in serving as a national supplier for its Stamps on Consignment program.  The Stamps on Consignment program has been an effective and efficient means for making postage stamps available to millions of customers where they work and shop.  However, the Postal Service is seeking to enhance this already successful program by soliciting new ideas and new approaches from potential suppliers.  
<p>
By responding to this Request for Information (RFI), interested companies have an opportunity to share their qualifications with the Postal Service and their concepts for providing the requested service, which do not contain information which the supplier would not be willing to share with other potential suppliers.  Interested companies that meet program requirements may be contacted by Postal Service representatives and may ultimately be asked to attend a supplier workshop or to submit a detailed proposal, based upon those discussions.  A retail agreement, in a form provided by the Postal Service, or, a Request for Proposal resulting in a contract, are possible results of this RFI.  However, the Postal Service does not guarantee that a retail agreement or an RFP will be issued as a result of this RFI process.
<p>
The Postal Service does not intend to pay for the information solicited.
<p>
Background 
<p>
Under the Stamps on Consignment program, the Postal Service currently distributes primarily U.S. postage stamp booklets to approximately 40,000 commercial retail outlets, located in all 50 states.  These retail outlets include grocery stores, drugstores, convenience stores, and bank ATMs.  The stamps are distributed by a national supplier, under contract with the Postal Service.   The stamps are sold at no more than face value at both retail and through ATMs.  Orders are fulfilled either on a subscription basis with a set monthly stamp volume or on demand with required minimum quantities ordered. 
<p>
Retailers receive no commission or payment from the Postal Service, but instead provide stamp sales as an adjunct to their business and as a convenience to their customers.  Retailers do not pay Postal Service or its distribution supplier up front for the postage, but instead pay for stamps generally within 30 days  (hence the term, “consignment”).
<p>
Besides distribution and replenishment, the Postal Service Stamps on Consignment supplier is responsible for soliciting new retailers to participate in this program and increasing the volume sold by current consignees.  Retailers, or “consignees,” place orders with the supplier who in turn requisitions new stamp stock from the Postal Service supply center.  Distribution is then made to the retailers.   Shipments to participating retailers of all stamps and materials, including marketing displays and supplies, are made using Postal Service services.  
<p>
Information Requested
<p>
Responses to this RFI should address the following capabilities.  However, respondents are also encouraged to identify additional capabilities, opportunities, and achievable innovation for Stamps on Consignment program enhancements. 
<p> 
1.   Company Capability 
<p>
•	Demonstration of a marketing plan and strategies to expand the channel volume significantly, reduce Postal Service costs and increase value. 
<p>
•	Description of plans to provide security, warehousing, and timely shipment of stamp stock to each participating retail location.
<p> 
•	Identification of the means proposed to re-supply stamp stock to ensure that all materials are continually stocked and orders received.  
<p>
•	Demonstration of the ability to identify, segregate and transmit payments by electronic funds transfer to designated finance sites.  
<p>
•	Demonstration of the ability to provide revenue reports to the Postal Service within a specified period from the close of each month.  The examples of such reports include:  shipped Value report (weekly amount of stamps shipped, returned etc.), inventory report (weekly forecast and churn), and sales report (current consignees, sales and sales forecast etc.).
<p>
2.  Revenue-Sharing Proposal
<p>
The Postal Service is particularly interested in translating the value of this channel and its presence in retail locations across the United States.  Consequently, the Postal Service may desire to enter into a revenue-sharing relationship with the selected company based on the agreed upon marketing strategies.  
<p>
Respondents are asked to propose a revenue-sharing strategy in which the Postal Service shares in the revenue generated through marketing this program through the Stamps on Consignment network.  The Stamps on Consignment program must be at a minimal or no cost (no out of pocket expenses) to the Postal Service.  
<p>
3.	Financial Capability 
<p>
Some respondents may be asked to submit financial statements for the past two years.  
<p>
4.	Contact Information
<p>
Responses must include the company representative’s name(s), title, business phone, fax, email and mailing address.  Interested companies should submit 5 copies of their response package to this RFI, by August 20, 2004 to the following address:
<p>
<p>Kathleen Hamilton
<p>RFI 2BRPSR-04-A-1408
<p>Retail Products & Services Category Team
<p>3300 S Parker Road, Suite 400
<p>Aurora CO 80016-3500
<p>
Responses to the RFI should not exceed 20 pages.
<p>
Questions regarding the content, objectives, or nature of this RFI must be submitted in writing, by email to Kathleen.Hamilton@usps.gov or by fax to Kathleen Hamilton at 303-369-1251.  Telephone inquiries will not be entertained.
<p>
Questions must be submitted at least two weeks prior to the response due date in order to allow sufficient time for the Postal Service to provide an answer.  
<p>
By responding to this Request for Information (RFI), interested companies have an opportunity to share their qualifications with the Postal Service and their concepts for providing the requested service.  Interested companies that present concepts that meet program requirements and present promising business opportunities may be contacted by Postal Service representatives and may ultimately be asked to attend a supplier workshop or to submit a detailed proposal, based upon those discussions.  
<p>
The Postal Service’s decision to pursue discussions with respondents to this RFI will be based upon a judgment of those companies that offer the best business opportunity.  The Postal Service may engage in discussions with multiple respondents.  
<p>
Based upon the Postal Service’s assessment of responses to the RFI and the business needs of the Postal Service, we may choose to pursue a retail agreement, in a form provided by the Postal Service, issue a Request for Proposal that could result in a contract or may continue with services provided through the existing supplier, via an existing contract option.  All companies that respond to this RFI will be informed of the Postal Service’s decision.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a sole source requirement for the upgrade of the capabilities of the laboratory for digital image acquisition from a stereomicroscope. NASA/KSC intends to purchase the items from C Squared Corporation of Ft. Lauderdale, FL.  The current configuration of the zoom stereomicroscope and boom stand in the laboratories contains Olympus Microscope hardware.  The proposed upgrade is also specified as Olympus hardware to work with the current boom stand and base so as not to require unique, or manufactured adapters.	Also, in order to obtain high precision digital images, precision microfocusing is used and any attempt to modify the existing boom stand or base to work with non-Olympus hardware could introduce unacceptable "Slop" in the microfocusing mechanism and significantly reduce the image quality. C Squared Corporation is the southeast regional distributor for Olympus Microscopes and is the sole source for procurement of Olympus Industrial Grade Microscope Hardware for facilities located in the Southeastern United States. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Jaime L. Carter, Mail Code:  OP-MS, Kennedy Space Center, FL 32899, Jaime.Carter@NASA.GOV not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on July 15, 2004.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is conducting a full and open competition to acquire the services of a qualified U.S. Contractor to implement a new education program which consists of a two-pronged approach that aims to increase access to quality and relevant education, building on past successes of increasing the number of rural girls completing basic education, and to improve skills training opportunities. 
The measurement of success is job placement and school completion.  Thus, the program addresses Morocco’s three-fold problem of unemployed out-of-school youth, lack of relevant education and training to provide skills for employment, and high illiteracy rates.  Coupled with this, the FTA with the U.S. offers Morocco a chance to transform itself and become a full and active participant in the global economy.  However, the transition to a new, more open economy will require new skills, with ramifications for both rural and urban populations.

Any resultant contract must include a minimum goal of 10% for small business subcontracting.

The base period of performance for this contract is four years plus one option year. The range for this activity is between $28 million to $32 million.

The preferred method of distributing the USAID procurement information will be through Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov).     It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about May 10, 2004.     It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation to ensure that it has been received in its entirety and USAID bears no responsibility for data error(s) resulting from downloading.     All correspondence regarding this notice must be submitted in writing.

Qualified Source: Pratt & Whitney (52661)

Note:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other
restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).

The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all  proposals received within forty five-days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.

To: ENSIGN-BICKFORD AEROSPACE & DEFENSE, SIMSBURY, CT.,06070-2420. Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR  6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all  proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering  agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This part required engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part.  Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s).  The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part.  An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.  The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The qualification requirements for this item were established prior to 19 Oct 1984 and the requirements of FAR 9.202(A) do not apply.  The specification control drawing requires a pre-production test instead of a first article test. See Note(s) 26.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for a two-year extension to the Transition Region & Coronal Explorer (TRACE) Satellite Mission Operations and Data Analysis contract (NAS5-38099) on a sole source basis under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, to Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC). This extension will provide continued monitoring of the health and performance of the one-instrument TRACE satellite.  The TRACE science investigation quantitatively explores the connection between fine-scale magnetic fields and the associated plasma structures of the sun.  The TRACE instrument collects sequences of digital images that show all regions of the atmosphere simultaneously using high resolution extreme ultraviolet radiation.  In December 1993, Lockheed Martin was competitively selected to define, design, fabricate, test, callibrate, and integrate the spacecraft, monitor and control orbital operations, and publish data from the TRACE instrument.  TRACE was launched in April 1988 and scheduled to allow joint observations with the Solar & Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite during the rising phase of the solar cycle to sunspot maximums.  In order to maintain uninterrupted mission operations and quick response to critical events and to avoid the loss of unique and vital research data, it is essential that Lockheed Martin continue to deliver the specialized support it has provided since contract award for TRACE and all related scientific investigative activities.  Therefore, Lockheed Martin is considered the only responsible source capable of fulfilling this requirement.	 The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.
PROPOSAL SUMISSION PLACE:
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to the El Salvadoran Ministerio de Economía (MINEC), in the assessment and design of a new national import processing system.

In Trade Capacity Building related discussions with the El Salvadoran delegation to the U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement negotiations, government Ministries and private trade associations, a common hurdle emerged focused on severe inefficiencies related to the processing of imported goods into the country.  To compete more effectively, the government of El Salvador is engaging several e-government initiatives, and related to trade capacity building, the National Import Processing System project is high on the priority list.  The current process to import goods into El Salvador is an antiquated and cumbersome system which is in need of revision if El Salvador wishes to better compete in the regional economy.  

CENTREX as a mechanism was created to promote exports by centralizing and simplifying the administrative process that govern the export process.  For example, in 1997, the processing of a paper-based export application took between five and fifteen days to process. In 2001 with the implementation of CENTREX, a web-based export application system, the processing time was reduced to five minutes per application.

While CENTREX has achieved the original objectives set forth, there are some constraints within the regulatory framework that governs the system.  One such constraint is that the regulatory framework only addresses exports and does not provide the same services for imports.  This is significant given that fact that 95% of exporters are also importers of raw materials and components used to manufacture goods that are then exported.  The current application process for import documentation is neither automated nor centralized and thus results in lengthy delays in processing imports, which increases the cost of such imports.

Based on the success of computerizing the export application function, MINEC is now seeking to implement an import functionality into CENTREX and improve the import processing efficiency on the same level as exports processing.  This will allow MINEC to consolidate all export and import processing and reporting functions into one integrated information system.  The benefits of the new information system will provide companies with the ability to submit import and export applications online.  Additionally, companies will be able to search for individual records and related documentation while the MINEC and other government agencies will have access to real-time statistics and have the ability to track trade related quotas.  

This project is considered one of the highest Trade Capacity Building initiatives for El Salvador.  The development and implementation of a national import application processing information system will create a streamlined and efficient process for importing foreign goods. USTDA support of the National Import Processing System project is consistent with our Trade Capacity Building efforts under the spirit of the U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement.

The objective of this project is to develop a new software application that automates the documentation required for importing goods into El Salvador.  It is envisaged that the new system will streamline import processing procedures for the entire country.  Additionally, the import software application will be integrated with the existing export information system, CENTREX.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Technical Assistance include the following:

Task 1: Define, procure and install server and development systems at MINEC. 
Task 2: Develop project plan review of information flow, database and developer training as necessary.
Task 3: Develop functional specifications for the information system.
Task 4: Develop an implementation plan detailing timeline and milestones.
Task 5: Develop conceptual and logical design for database model.
Task 6: Develop initial version of the application.
Task 7: Conduct testing of the application with users and retest as necessary.
Task 8: Conduct staff and user training.
Task 9: Deploy live system with monitoring of usage and performance.
Task 10: Complete systems documentation/documents designed for staff and administrators.
Task 11: Train staff in support, maintenance, backup, and recovery procedures.
Task 12: Evaluate the project with quantifiable performance and evaluation methodology. 
  	   Submit final report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $387,492 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background Definitional Mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

Specifically the contractor shall use data collected for the 2000-2001 CoE quantitative evaluation of 15 CoE sites designated at the time of data collection to study whether access to a CoE for primary care resulted in equivalent quality of care for black, white and Latina women and by poverty status (ascertained by income and insurance status).  Specifically this study shall analyze the differences in quality of care as described by race/ethnicity and by income level within the CoE and predictors of differences in quality of care and satisfaction shall be explored and between race/ethnic group and income group compared with like differences in the benchmark data, i.e. Commonwealth Fund Survey and CoE Community Comparison data – Anderson, et al. 2002, using analysis of covariance methods adjusting for co-variables and by tests of means and proportions.  A fixed price contract shall be awarded in accordance with FAR Subpart 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

This will require total re-coding of the combined ARA-Vertek, PDA, and “handshake” programs into a single, seamless module controlled within WinOCPT.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>W911QY-04-R-0015
<RESPDATE>072704
<ARCHDATE>09252004
<CONTACT>Kimberly Chamberlain, 508-233-5922
<DESC>The U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA is interested in demonstrating a novel acquisition concept for the supply chain integration/management of various compone nts of the new Army Combat Uniform (ACU) Ensemble.  The ACU Ensemble components to be managed under this effort are the ACU coat, ACU trousers, ACU Patrol Cap and ACU Sun Hat.  The traditional approach of procuring garments for the military is challenging to both the Government (Army) and Industry.  The Army faces the challenge of having the right quantity of garments, by size, at the right time to meet Soldier demands.  Demand requirements are not constant, and given the current world situation with troops  deploying in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), demand levels are even more unstable.  Additional constraints in availability of funding and Governmental regulatory and statutory procedures exacerbate the ArmyÃ¢ Â€Â™s challenge.  Industry is faced with the challenge of forecasting demand against this extremely dynamic environment.  As the ArmyÃ¢Â€Â™s demand requirements continuously change, industry is faced with rapid changes to production.  The impact of demand changes increase as they travel down the supply chain.  This bullwhip effect results in stops and starts in production, and these stops and starts affect quality.  Given these challenges and constraints, this demonstration project intends to address the is sues on a small scale using selected components of the new ACU.  This project will require successor offeror(s) to establish and maintain a continuous flow of product down at least one (up to three) supply chains for a delivery period specified by the cont ractor(s) while fielding the ACU to as many deploying troops as possible.  Interested sources must have experience in manufacturing end items or materials used in the current Army Battle Dress Uniform (BDU).  The Government HIGHLY ENCOURAGES sources to tea m with members of the supply chain for this demonstration project and will consider any member of the supply chain (garment manufacturer, dying & finishing manufacturer, greige good manufacturer or yarn manufacturer) to be the lead (prime) contractor.   Mu ltiple contracts are anticipated as follows:  up to 3 contracts (awarded on a full and open competitive basis) to contractor team(s) (1) to demonstrate a novel approach to supply chain management and (2) to produce and deliver selected components of the AC U.  An additional contract will be awarded on a sole source basis to Clemson Apparel Research (CAR) [see Pre-solicitation Notice USA-SNOTE-040708-002].  CAR has developed advanced supply chain management concepts as part of the Defense Logistics Agency (DL A) Apparel Research Network (ARN) MANTECH project.  CAR will coordinate the supply chain by maintaining total asset visibility and providing synchronized replenishment order, shipping and manufacturing recommendations based on the supply chain concepts and  tools developed for the DLA ARN program.  The GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s intent is for source(s) to partner with Clemson Apparel Research (CAR) in this demonstration project.  This novel acquisition concept is intended to demonstrate total supply chain management from raw materials to finished garment delivery.  The goal of this demonstration is to reduce both cost and schedule, while increasing quality through leveling the production flow throughout the supply chain.  The Army has a set aside $12M for this demonst ration project, subject to any unforeseen funding constraints.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System code is 315211, with a size standard of 500 employees. The anticipated release date of the solicitation is on or about 27 JULY 2004 . This acquisition is being conducted under the guidance of FAR Part 15.  Once released, the full and open competition solicitation will be available on the Arm y Single Face to Industry site as well as the Natick Contracting Division's web site under 'business opportunities; ongoing acquisitions' at https://www 3.natick.army.mil.  Questions may be addressed to Kimberly Chamberlain via email at kimberly.chamberlai n@us.army.mil.

This procurement is 100% set-aside for 8(a) firms serviced by either t he SBA San Francisco District Office or the SBA Fresno District Office, and must possess a bona fide place of business within the territories of either of these two district offices.  JOB DESCRIPTION:  Bank protection, stabilization, and mitigation of 1600 lineal feet of levee along the left bank of the Sacramento River.  All work is to be done from the waterside.  The stabilization and bank protection part of the work involves clearing  large and dense trees and vegetation, as well as breaking in place and moving large amounts of concrete rubble.  Excess rebar and other metal will need to be removed as well.  Approximately 65,000 tons of rock are to be placed over the cleared slope to st abilize the over steep levee slope and provide bank protection.  The mitigation part of the job includes removing large (3+ feet dbh) trees removed from the site.  40 trees removed are to be saved and anchored back onto a rock berm built as part of the sta bilization/bank protection part of the work.  A 5-foot deep planting trench is also to be built into the rock berm.  The planting trench will provide a medium for trees to be planted in 2005 as part of a subsequent contract.  Much of the work is in-water i n an urban environment.  Landside access for heavy equipment is not available.  The levee part of the jobsite is over steep terrain and is hazardous to move about.  Large, tall trees will need to be trimmed and felled onto the steep levee slopes.  Safety p recautions will need to be a top priority.

<RESPDATE>063004
<ARCHDATE>07152004
<CONTACT>Kimberly Groves, Purchasing Agent, Phone 304-285-5885, Fax 304-285-6083, Email kpg0@cdc.gov - Brenda Goodwin, Contract Specialist, Phone (304)285-5882, Fax (304)285-6083, Email bcg1@cdc.gov
<DESC>This posting further amends an earlier synopsis entitled “Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) Support Services” which was initially posted on April 20, 2004, amended by a posting on May 6, 2004 and further amended June 15, 2004.     Information contained in the amendment is being provided to better define requirements for submission of capabilities from alternative sources.     

BACKGROUND:     Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is an incurable brain disorder that occurs with an incidence of 1 case per million annually. The majority of patients die within 6 months of illness onset. The disease causes damage to the brain leaving patients completely dependent on their caregivers for the most basic needs of daily living. The services provided through this project will greatly assist in achieving CDC’s goal of increasing the number of autopsies of suspected CJD cases, increasing public awareness about CJD, and providing support to CJD families. To date, the CJD Foundation has implemented several initiatives to provide support to CJD patients and their families. 

These initiatives include maintaining a toll-free helpline to provide support to these family members who have gone through the same experience, creating a forum in which family members can receive assistance and discuss issues relating to home and post-mortem care, and facilitate dialogue between researchers working on CJD and the family members.     These discussions help researchers to gain more knowledge about the social impacts of the disease and exchange ideas on potential areas of research.     

CDC is convinced that the more CDC can provide help to diagnosing neurologists and to the relatives of patients and the more relatives know about prion diseases, the more likely such relatives will want, or at least not object to, obtaining a brain autopsy on the CJD patient. 

Learning more about prion diseases through autopsy study of CJD cases would assist in the surveillance of potentially emerging forms of the disease and would facilitate the development of a pre-mortem diagnostic test or treatment for CJD.    An important objective of this acquisition is to increase the number of autopsies of CJD cases by educating family members and health care providers about the need for autopsy.     

PURPOSE:     This acquisition is intended to enhance surveillance of human prion disease by maintaining a toll-free helpline that provides guidance and information to families of CJD patients and creating a forum in which families can exchange information. The service provided by this acquisition should encourage family members of CJD patients to discuss the need for autopsy with the attending physician and increase family member?s awareness about the critical need for autopsy.       Autopsy information provides CDC a means to identify new and emerging dieases early.    Continued sponsorship of a national conference in which family members can discuss issues and facilitate dialogue with CJD researchers will raise public awareness about CJD and provide prion disease researchers with an opportunity to share their work and target new research activities.


SPECIFIC TASKS TO BE PERFORMED:     

A)     Maintain a toll-free helpline 24 hours/7 days a week, manned between the hours of 8:00 am to 5:00 pm with voice mail and remote access on evenings and weekends.     The helpline would provide:    1)   Information to family members of CJD patients about the disease to help them prepare for the eventual fatal outcome of the disease;   2)  A forum in which family members of CJD patients can network to share information with each other;  and   3)   guidance on various types of services (e.g., hospice, funeral home) that would be helpful to family members of CJD patients

B)     Educate family members of CJD patients by  producing a booklet   “Guide for autopsy of suspected CJD cases,” highlighting current barriers to autopsies and indicating why autopsies are needed and the need for family members to provide consent for autopsies. Such an information booklet could also highlight the fact that surveillance for emerging forms of CJD and progress in CJD research, particularly the development of a pre-mortem CJD test or treatment, heavily rely on learning more about the disease through autopsy studies of CJD cases.

C)     Educate health care workers and the public about CJD via a website,  teleconferences, meetings, and development of educational materials to:   1) Increase awareness about the disease;    2)  Describe the need to conduct autopsy of suspected CJD cases to facilitate surveillance of the disease;  and   3)  Increase awareness about the state-of-the art free CJD diagnostic services provided by the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center.

D)     Sponsor a national conference that would bring together family members and  professionals working on prion diseases.

Among the deliverables are 1) statistics on the number and type of phone calls handled on the toll free helpline; 2) copies of education materials developed by the awardee; and 3) summaries of the proceedings of the conference including the number of persons attending.     

Through this announcement, alternate sources are being offered the opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities to provide the services specifically identified above.       

To be considered qualified, sources must submit a capabilities statement which demonstrates in writing that they possess at least two years of task-related experience in maintaining a toll-free helpline 24 hours/7 days a week, producing informational booklets, educating healthcare workers and the public via a website, teleconferences, meetings and the development of educational material, and sponsoring a national conference.  Specific CJD subject matter experience is not required to be submitted in the offeror’s capability statements.

Qualified organizations are encouraged to submit a capabilities statement which addresses the requirements and contains material in sufficient detail to allow the CDC to determine if the party can perform this requirement.     Capabilities are to be received in the contracting office no later than ten (10) days from the date of this amended announcement.     Submit written information to:       Kimberly Groves, MS-1019, Reference:     0000HCRU-2004-08490, DHHS/PHS/CDC, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV     26505, or responses may be submitted electronically to Kimberly Groves at kpg0@cdc.gov.       

The intent of this synopsis is to determine whether alternative sources exist.   Information received will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   

 All responsible sources may submit a response, which shall be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>Anticipated Request for Proposal DE-RP07-04ID14615 ?Tank Waste Enhanced Processing? Addendum No. 1 to Fed Biz Ops Announcement dated July 2, 2004 The purpose of this notice is to amend and provide supplemental information to the basic announcement posted on July 2, 2004.  Summary information from the draft statement of work referenced in the basic July 2nd posting is provided as follows:  The purpose of the work is for the Contractor to evaluate its enhanced high level ? tank waste processing technology pursuant to significantly accelerating the schedule and/or reducing the cost and risk of the U. S. Department of Energy?s (DOE) Environmental Management (EM) High Level Radioactive Waste (HLW) Program.  Background - The DOE EM Office needs to accelerate the schedule and/or dramatically reduce the cost of the EM High Level Radioactive Waste program at the Idaho, Savannah River, and Hanford Sites.  A Request for Information (RFI) was issued to the public in October 2003, requesting descriptions of innovative technologies and alternate approaches to meet this need.  The RFI targeted the following technical areas: tank waste retrieval; separations of chemicals and radionuclides; low activity waste immobilization; retrieval and disposition of granular calcine; and treatment of sodium-bearing aqueous waste for disposal.   DOE?s review of the responses to the RFI indicates that there are technology applications available with potential to reduce program cost and/or accelerate the schedule. DOE-EM has decided to pursue a contract with an entity to demonstrate a HLW processing technology (or technologies) with potentially high return on investment. Scope of Work - The scope of work is for the contractor to demonstrate process performance of its technology.  This will occur via the preparation of a test plan outline, execution of the test with Contractor and/or subcontractor owned and operated facilities and equipment using a DOE provided waste surrogate, and then issuing a test results report to include a sample of the processed surrogate.  The Contractor must perform this work consistent with the implementation strategy and claims made in the Contractor?s proposal submitted in response to the RFP.  (The Contractor?s proposal will be incorporated into the contract by reference and will be considered a material part of this Statement of Work.)  Technical tasks to be completed are as follows: 1) Complete a Test Plan outline; 2) Perform testing, and 3).  Complete a Test Evaluation Report and a processed waste surrogate sample. All work should be completed no later than six months from award of contract. Milestone payments commensurate to the value/cost of each of the three technical tasks may be requested and negotiated.  Schedule - the RFP will be issued on or about July 23, 2004, on the DOE ?e-center? site at http://e-center.doe.gov/  (also known or referred to as the ?IIPS? system ? Industry Interactive Procurement System) and proposals will be due no later than September 6, 2004.  Though the RFP will be posted on the e-center site, hard copies of proposals will be required to be sent to the DOE Nuclear Energy ? Idaho Operations Office rather than posting proposals on the e-center site. Award is anticipated in November, 2004.  DOE may use the $2.5M in funding available to make two awards.  The RFP will allow for submittal of questions and answers will be provided.  Oral presentations are not anticipated yet DOE reserves the right to conduct orals if necessary.  At the e-center site you will be able to download the solicitation, after it is posted, and register with the system.  If you need technical assistance in registering or for any other IIPS ? e-center function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or E-mail the Help Desk personnel at IIPS_HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov.

<DESC>Since there are multiple applicable Modeling and Simulation (M&S) software codes, potential offerors will be responsible for demonstrating best value to the Government.  The Government has therefore deleted the requirement to obtain access to proprietary M&S computer code (ISAAC and ABLE).  Based upon this change, the Draft Task Statement (Statement of Work) has been updated accordingly.

THE PREVIOUS DESCRIPTION, ALONG WITH ALL UPDATES/MODIFICATIONS, IS HEREBY REPLACED IN ITS ENTIRETY WITH THE FOLLOWING:

The ABL Element of the Missile Defense Agency, Kirtland Air Force Base NM is contemplating an award of a contract to provide advisory and assistance services (A&AS).  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. This procurement is a follow-on action to the current ABL A&AS contract that is scheduled to expire 31 March, 2005.  This requirement covers the A&AS requirements for MDA/AL including but not limited to Airborne Laser, Airborne Sensors and Laser Technology Program.  The ABL is a high-energy laser system integrated on a Boeing 747 aircraft that is being tested for destroying theater ballistic missiles in their boost phase.
	At present, the ABL office requires approximately 107 man-year (per year) equivalent heads of A&AS support.  The A&AS contractor(s) shall support, provide expertise and oversight/insight and participate in ABL integrated product teams.  The current integrated product teams include:  Aircraft; Airborne Sensors; Battle Management Command, Control and Communication Computers and Integration and Intelligence (BMC4I); Beam Control/Fire Control (BC/FC); Ground Support and Laser IPTs.  The A&AS contractor(s) shall support the ABL office through engineering analyses, segment modeling and simulation, and review and evaluation of segment concepts, architectures and designs.  The A&AS contractor(s) shall also provide specific segment modeling and simulation support to include wave optics and scaling laws, BMC4I predictive avoidance analysis, and Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser (COIL) design analysis.  The A&AS contractor(s) shall provide specific segment design engineering analysis for atmospheric characterization (turbulence statistics and cloud analysis), laser beam quality, adaptive optics, large optic designs, vibration, aero-optics, the pressure recovery subsystem, and acquisition, tracking and pointing.  The A&AS contractor(s) shall provide specific system modeling and simulation.  The A&AS contractor(s) must have extensive, in-depth and current experience with High Energy Laser (HEL) weapon system technologies, systems and applications, as well as hands-on experience in analysis/experiments and testing with the HEL technologies.  Expertise is required in laser physics, physics, gas dynamics, optical engineering, electro-optics and structural engineering (thermal/mechanical).  Extensive experience is required in COIL for the ABL weapon and solid state lasers for the ABL illuminator, including integrated laser/optical resonator analysis, pressure recovery system, laser chemistry and optical non-linear phenomena.  Experience is also required in high energy laser weapon system beam control, vibration isolation/control, integrated laser controls, laser tracking and pointing and laser beam aim point maintenance, as well as atmospheric turbulence analysis, wave optics codes, high energy laser propagation, atmospheric compensation and adaptive optics.  ABL also requires experience in missile tracking/signatures, high energy laser effects, passive/active missile tracking algorithms and damage assessment for HEL effects, as well as systems-level modeling and simulation to include airborne HEL weapon systems and subsystems, aircraft platforms, atmospheric propagation, ballistic missile threats and mission and campaign-level engagement performance analysis.  Finally, the contractor shall provide support in the areas of security, computer network information technology, technical writing, and graphic support, as well as specialized support in contracting, personnel, and program control. 
	A copy of the draft A&AS Statement of Work (SOW), upon which the forecasted work and this sources sought synopsis is based, can be found with this announcement and at http://www.acq.osd.mil/bmdo/barbb/barbb.htm.  
	Personnel on the A&AS contract shall have a minimum of a Secret clearance, Completed National Agency Check (NAC), or have submitted for a NAC in order to use government information systems and/or to access certain ABL unclassified information.  Access to classified information requires either a final or interim clearance at the appropriate level. Approximately 80% of the personnel that would support this A&AS contract will require a Top Secret (single scope background investigation [SSBI]) clearance that is current within the last five years.  Please contact the Contracting Officer if additional information is necessary (please provide your CAGE code with this request).  Potential offerors shall submit statements of capabilities (SOCs) to this office. Each SOC shall specifically address each SOW paragraph.  Additionally, the SOC package shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the following areas:  1) Experience:  an outline of previous efforts, specific work previously performed and any in-house effort, relevant to the specific task areas of this effort; including a proposed organizational conflict of interest mitigation plan (not included in the page limitation), if required; and 2) Personnel: the names, professional qualifications and specific experience of personnel who will be assigned to work in areas of interest.  The SOCs must be received by the SPO POC listed below on 25 May 2004.  There is a 45 page SOC page limitation, and submissions must be unclassified.  All replies to this synopsis must reference this sources sought synopsis and number FA8632-04-R-2453.  Submit all responses to ASC/TMK, Attn:  Martin Baca, 1350 Wyoming Blvd SE, Bldg 20200, Kirtland AFB, NM  87117-5536.
	The contract is anticipated to be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ), five-year task order contract.  Anticipate contract award in December, 2004.  This acquisition will be procured using full and open competition procedures.  Firms responding should indicate if they are a large, small, an 8(a), a HUBZone small business, a veteran owned small business, a service disabled veteran small business, a historically black college or university, women-owned business, or a minority institution.  For this proposed acquisition and using the small business size standard for NAICS code 541710, the size standard of 500 employees applies.  Foreign firms are advised to contact the Contracting Officer before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are any restrictions on receiving award.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear the concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate serious concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Potential offerors should communicate first with the Contracting Officer to request information, pose a question, and voice concerns before contacting the Ombudsman.  In those instances where offerors cannot obtain resolution from the Contracting Officer, they are invited to contact Mr. Mike O’Neill at 703.695.9122.  For contracting issues, please contact Mr. Martin Baca at 505.846.0775.  The specifics on an industry day, if desired, will be published in FedBizOpps and is planned after release of the Draft RFP.  See Numbered Notes: 25 and 26.

<DESC>CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR 
IRS KANSAS CITY CAMPUS CONSOLIDATION 
Solicitation Number:  GS06P04GZC0006
Main Post Office, 315 W. Pershing Road, Kansas City, Missouri.

Clarification of Pre-Proposal Conference:  July 14, 2004, 2:00 p.m. Central Time, 2500 West Pennway, Kansas City, MO.

This solicitation is set aside for exclusive small business participation, in accordance with FAR 19.502-2.  The NAICS code is 236620, and the small business size standard is $28,500,000.  Offers received from business concerns that do not qualify as a small business concern shall be considered nonresponsive and shall be rejected.  

The purpose of this source selection procurement is to select a Construction Management (CM) contractor for GSA’s IRS Kansas City Campus Consolidation at the Main Post Office, 315 W. Pershing Road, Kansas City, Missouri.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a general scope of work, specifications, the solicitation provisions, the proposal submittal requirements and the evaluation factors.  The RFP will be issued on or about June 23, 2004.  Estimated cost range is $1,000,000 -- $4,000,000 for the base year and up to three option years.  The options will be exercised if the Government chooses, and if the CM contractor’s performance is satisfactory.  Award is expected to be made in August 2004 for the base year.  This contract is limited to only those firms having an existing CM services contracting office in the state of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri or Nebraska and such office shall have been in operation as of the date of this notice. Additional preference will be given to those firms having an existing CM services contracting office in the Kansas City Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) and such office shall have been in operation as of the date of this notice.  The SMSA includes the Kansas counties of Franklin, Johnson, Leavenworth, Linn, Miami, and Wyandotte; and the Missouri counties of Bates, Caldwell, Cass, Clay, Clinton, Jackson, Lafayette, Platte, and Ray. Contractors working with or for the Developer/Lessor or its subcontractors will not be allowed to compete in this solicitation.

The existing Main Post Office has been acquired by DST Realty as Developer/Lessor.  The building will be completely renovated.  The Government, as Lessee, is contracting for a 1,140,000 rentable square foot lease. The remaining square feet and parking will be build-to-suit.  GSA will manage the Lessor/Developer’s performance of the lease requirements.  The selected CM will be responsible for the following activities, which are not limited to:  design; procurement; construction; and post-construction phase services.  Design phase services include design reviews of the drawings and specifications; verification that the completed design complies with GSA standards, applicable codes, and is within the scope of work identified for the project.  Construction phase services include inspection of work performed by the general contractor for conformity with contract requirements; monitoring review and approval of submittals required by the contract documents; monitoring the budget for the entire project to maintain an accurate cost picture of the project; providing reports comparing budgeted costs with current cost estimates; and reviewing Lessor’s cost estimates to ensure the project can be completed with available funds.  This phase also includes review and monitoring of the schedule; chairing meetings and maintaining meeting minutes; preparing reports; notifying GSA of problems and issues that arise; and providing independent cost estimates for lease contract modifications.  Post-construction phase services include deficiencies and omissions inspections, maintaining as-built drawings; and support for other post-construction phase activities. 

GSA anticipates the award of a negotiated firm fixed price contract using source selection procedures to obtain the greatest value for the Government.  The Government intends to use the “trade-off process” in selecting the contractor.  The “trade-off process” is a method of evaluating technical qualification factors specified in the solicitation, and then price, with the goal being to select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in terms of both technical qualifications and price.  For this procurement, technical qualifications are more important than price.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage one will consist of technical evaluations.  Stage two will consist of price evaluations.  Offerors must submit their technical proposals and price proposals at the same time, but in separate packages.  Technical proposals will be evaluated using the following technical factors, in order of importance:  1)  Past Performance of the firm; 2) Qualifications of Proposed Personnel; and 3) Management Plan.   Proposals will first be evaluated for technical qualifications.  After all proposals have been evaluated for technical qualifications, price proposals will be opened and separately evaluated.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price.  The price factor is not as important as the technical evaluation factors.  However, as proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important.  Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality service.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals and establish a competitive range if necessary.  The evaluation team will comply with the GSA Source Selection Policy with respect to nondisclosure, conflict of interest, safeguarding of data and any other regulatory or statutory requirement therein stated or referenced.  Award of a contract will be contingent upon funding approval.   

In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of solicitations and amendments.  The solicitation (specifications) and its amendments will only be available through a link in www.fedbizopps.gov to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov <http://www.ccr.gov>) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov <http://www.fedteds.gov>).  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  Offerors are responsible for producing their own print sets for their own use.   

Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  At minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: 

1.	Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Company's CCR Point of Contact; 
2.	Your Company's DUNS Number (800-333-0505 if you do not have one) or CAGE Code; 
3.	Your Company’s Tax ID Number; 
4.	Your Telephone Number; and 
5.	Your E-Mail Address.  

Your CCR registration should take approximately 48 hours for processing and activation.  Once you have registered with CCR you may then register with FEDTeDS to view solicitations.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may register with FEDTeDS via the following URL https://www.fedteds.gov/.  If you have not used the site previously, please go to "Register with FedTeds" and read the Vendor User Guide.  The official plan holders list will be based on only those requesting specifications through FedTeDS. 

A pre-proposal conference is not anticipated.  Proposals shall be received at GSA on or about July 23, 2004.  Specific date, time and location shall be specified in the RFP, expected to be available when the solicitation is posted on www.fedbizopps.gov on or about June 23, 2004.

Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  Proposals submitted should be acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  

The RFP specification will be available by link via the Solicitation.  The list of plan holders will be based only on those requesting the proposal documents via FEDTeDS (see above) through the link contained in this announcement.  Those requesting specifications must first register at www.ccr.gov.  Contact Carol Watkins, Contracting Officer, for questions concerning this announcement at 816-823-4906 or fax her at 816-823-5523.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, Doug Benton, at 816-823-4601, or fax at (816) 823-5906.

<DESC>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small businesses to provide all management, supervision, administration, and labor for the administrative support of specific extramural research programs at the NIH.  For the purposes of this survey, this includes 1) Grants management support services (e.g., administrative and logistical support, file management, IMPAC II and other data management), 2) support for review of grants and R&D contracts (e.g., administrative support, IMPAC II and other data management, meeting logistics, internal receipt and referral, processing of assigned applications and proposals, and document processing and preparation), and 3) technical support services (e.g., administrative support, logistical support for conferences and workshops, IMPAC II and other related support, and support for scientific and technical activities) to Program management.  Services are to be provided to the NIH Bethesda campus, other locations in Montgomery County, Maryland and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. It is noted that these extramural activities support services are currently performed by Government and contract employees providing support to the NIH extramural research programs, estimated at $20 billion annually.  The acquisition will be for one (1) 12-month period with four (4) 12 month options and will comply with the OMB Circular A-76 in effect at the time the solicitation is issued. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 561110, Administrative Services, with a size standard of an average annual receipts of $6.0M over the last 3 years.  

The Government reserves the right to decide the method of procurement strategy, i.e., 8(a) contracting or service-disabled small business set-aside, based on the response to this market survey. 

If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these contract services, please provide the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address and telephone number as well as size and type of ownership for the organization, i.e., small business, Small Disadvantaged Business, 8(a), woman-owned, Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) concern, Veteran, and or Service-disabled Veteran; and 2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability. Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements to demonstrate that small business prime contractors can maintain labor, technical, and management control of the project, meeting the Alimitations on subcontracting@ imposed on small business set-asides. Taking into account the magnitude of the scope of this effort, organizations also should address the capacity of their financial infrastructure to deliver contract performance. Although no geographic restriction is anticipated, if responding organizations are located outside the Washington Metropolitan area, indicate how the organization would coordinate with the agency program office to provide support to multiple sites.

<DESC>The U.S.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) is conducting a Sources Sought/Market Survey FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, to determine if small and small disadvantaged businesses possess the necessary technical capabilities to support OPP's Environmental Fate and Effects Division (EFED). THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING  INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND/OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.  NO TELEPHONE CALLS REQUESTING A SOLICITATION WILL BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME, HOWEVER, A DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) IS AVAILABLE.  RESPONSES SHALL NOT EXCEED 40 PAGES AND STANDARD COMPANY BROCHURES ARE NOT DESIRED.  INFORMATION SHALL FOCUS ON THE CAPABILITY TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES DEFINED BELOW.   OPP develops data requirements and guidelines for the conduct of studies by registrants that are used, along with other data and information, to assess the potential impact of the use of the pesticide on human health and the environment.  Before EPA can use studies and data in assessing risk, these data must be evaluated to determine their adequacy and validity and to ensure that appropriate quality assurance procedures were carried out.  Once data have been evaluated and determined to be acceptable and valid, these data are used to assess risk to human health and ecological resources.   The OPP requires support primarily in the area of review and evaluation of available data pertaining to the assessment of the ecological risk of pesticides in the environment (including the evaluation of environmental monitoring data).  The OPP is responsible for the regulation of pesticides through the registration, registration review and  reregistration of pesticides and screening for ecological risk from use of pesticides on individual crops and crop groupings.  This procurement will also provide occasional support to EPA in the researching of pesticide ecological risk and related science policy issues and the development of science policy options for evaluation and consideration by EPA.   Requirements will be to (1) evaluate individual studies of environmental processes and identify any variance from published guidelines/standard evaluation practices/data review guidelines, etc., (2) evaluate environmental monitoring data and characterize the nature and extent of measured contamination, (3) perform an environmental risk screen with a certain level of detail, (4) extract data from the individual studies and enter in an OPP-provided database and (5) evaluate data from the open literature when specifically requested by EPA, (6) Enhanced Review.   The data requirements to support registration or reregistration are delineated in 40 CFR Part 158, Guidelines for Registering Pesticides in the United States 1982, Subpart N and other applicable documents which will require the ability to obtain appropriate security clearances.   Appropriate Conflict of Interest (COI), Confidential Business Information (CBI) and FIFRA clauses will apply to these requirements.  You are directed to the EPA Website under the Sources Sought solicitation number at "www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/0411902/index.htm" for full details on this synopsis and the draft version of the SOW.   For the purpose of focusing on the responses to this notice, most of the work under this requirement is anticipated in Task 1, "Evaluation of Data (DERs)", Task 2, "Hazard Profile or Ecological Effects Summary", Task 3, "Review of Incident Information", Task 4, "Entry of Data/Information into OPP-Provided Databases", Task 5, "Special Assignments", and Task 6, "Enhanced Review".   Vendors with the capability of providing services defined in the SOW are invited to submit, in writing, sufficient information within the page limitation (40 pages) which demonstrates their ability to fulfill the requirement.

<DESC>Description

Intermittent Contractor - Subject-Matter Expert.  Background: The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates numerous international training and assistance programs.  These programs are located in various countries throughout the world and address the entire range of CBP control operations.  To effectively implement these programs, there is a need for the employment and utilization of contractors on an intermittent or short-term basis (Intermittent Contractor or IC’s). Short term is defined as a single assignment for 90 days or less; many assignments will be less then 30 days.  IC’s will be required to perform various tasks, such as those associated with training, utilizing specialized equipment, or to provide professional and technical assistance in specific topical areas.  The following are a delineation of the types of general services that IC’s are expected to provide.  A more specific description of services or tasks shall be provided to the IC upon selection.  

Training: The IC shall serve as a subject-matter expert and/or presenter.  He/she may be required to present Customs or border control training based on an existing CBP curriculum.  Instruction may include but is not limited to the areas of narcotic interdiction, post security, customs investigation techniques, money laundering, intellectual property rights, control of weapons of mass destruction, commercial import/export operations, or customs valuation.  In general, the topic and content of the course for instruction will be established, in advance, with course material normally provided by CBP.  The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training to serve as an instructor in general and in specific areas of instruction.  

Course Developer: The IC shall develop a set of course materials on a given topic for later presentation by either CBP personnel on in-county advisors.  Courses to be developed could be in any customs or border control related areas such as the areas described for “Training” above.  The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training in course development for one or more related areas.  

Assessments: The IC may conduct on-site assessments of customs services and other border control agencies located in foreign countries.  Assessments may be general in scope or geared to specific areas (e.g., control of weapons of mass destruction or intellectual property rights).  Tasks could include such actions as physical border surveys, equipment-need surveys, and broader surveys of the entire governmental enforcement system.  The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the necessary experience and skills for an authoritative and professional review of the specific agencies or programs to prepare trip reports, summaries, analyses and recommendations.  

Technical Assistance:  The IC may provide technical assistance in highly specialized areas such as legal reform, inspectional technology (both high and low-tech), port security or specialized field operations.  For example, in the areas of legal reform, tasks may include the review of customs law and regulations of a country, making recommendations for improvement of such laws, or providing technical assistance in the preparation of new laws and regulations that meet the needs of a specific country.  The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess specialized knowledge, experience, and background related to specific areas of expertise.  

Augmentation and Replacement: The IC may augment a technical team or temporarily replace a technical team member.  As an additional team member, the contractor will undertake general or specific tasks associated with various projects such as the development of an interagency taskforce or the review of personnel policies.  As a replacement or “fill-in”, the IC may replace and assume the tasks of a technical team member who may be away from post for an extended period of time.  The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess the necessary knowledge, experience, and skills to serve as an additional advisor, team member, or replacement member.  

Terms and Conditions: Most IC assignments will be less then 30 days, with adequate advance notice prior to deployment.  Some assignments may last up to 90 days.  It is not envisioned that an IC would be on duty more than 90 days in a calendar year.  If an IC turns down more that two assignments he or she may be removed form further consideration at CBP discretion.  

Compensation and other reimbursements: 1) Compensation will be fixed-priced at $2000 per week for all IC’s or proration thereof.  2) The IC contract will include medical evacuation coverage up to $500, and medical examination costs up to $500.   3) Each assignment will be firm-fixed priced based on the estimated time required to complete the assignment.   4) All travel will be under U.S. Government Travel orders and in accordance with applicable U.S. Government Travel regulations.  Note: The contractor will be reimbursed for all official travel upon completion of a travel voucher in accordance with an approved travel authorization.  CBP will purchase airline or other common carrier tickets subsequent to approval of travel.  The contractor will not receive an advance for lodging, meals and incidentals.  

Other requirements: 1) IC’s may be required to undergo updated background investigations to obtain a “secret” security clearance from CBP.  2) For some specific assignments, language ability may be a requirement for selection. All materials provided to the contractor or developed by the contractor under this contract are the property of CBP and may not be released outside CBP without permission.  

Possible duty locations: IC’s must be willing and able to work in any country in which CBP conducts operations.  CBP training and assistance projects are currently on-going in all regions of the world.  In addition, IC’s may be required to work from their home, at CBP Headquarters in Washington, D.C., or at other duty locations as needed within in the United States.  

Method of operation: Potential IC’s will submit their qualifications in resume format.  The Office of International Affairs will evaluate the candidates for technical ability.  Candidates will then be considered part of a “bidders” list and may be selected for future assignments.  Customs will reimburse selectees for the cost of obtaining international medical evacuation insurance and for a physical examination and certification that they are fit for travel anywhere in the world for assignments up to 90 days.  Selected IC’s will then become part of a “pool” of eligible contractors who may receive requests for services.  These contracts will contain the detailed statement of work for the specific assignment, including services required, estimated time required, country, travel dates, materials and topics to be addressed, and any required materials.  At the end of the project the IC will submit an invoice for payment.  All taxes (federal, state and/or local) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) income reporting requirements are the responsibility of the IC as a 1099 vendor.  IC’s must register in the Central Contractor Registration system at www.ccr.gov prior to issuance of an order. 

Resumes will be accepted by e-mail only.  Submit to CBP.PSC@DHS.GOV.  No acknowledgement will be made by CBP upon receipt of resume.  Please, no phone calls.

<DESC>The U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) is seeking sources within industry and academia to participate in a government led-series of experiments to improve interoperability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and related intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities.  These experiments, entitled Extended Awareness, will provide a venue to enable the Government to further improve interoperability of UAVs and ISR systems.  The experiments will be held during Fiscal Year 2005 in the Fort Huachuca, AZ area and other sites as determined by USJFCOM.  Experiment participants will collaborate to identify potential systems architecture innovations that could enhance the integration of multiple dissimilar UAV systems, sensor capabilities, and intelligence disciplines in a coherent framework that provides information to the widest range of warfighters at the operational and tactical levels of war in a collaborative network centric environment.  Proposed capabilities must be mature enough to be easily integrated with other technologies and potentially usable by warfighters when the experiments are concluded.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  Public Law 107-107 directs USJFCOM to establish the flight activity capability to evaluate and ensure the joint interoperability of UAV systems.  Commander USJFCOM has stated his interests are to drive interoperability, drive experimentation, and drive born joint UAV and related ISR systems requirements.  In FY 2004 USJFCOM conducted a series of experiments entitled Forward Look based upon the hypothesis that multiple, dissimilar UAVs operated in a synchronized, coordinated fashion from a single node would improve the performance of those UAVs over that performance possible if they were operated independently within their organic architecture.  The Extended Awareness experiments will expand on Forward Look and evaluate systems and operational architecture innovations for coordinating and synchronizing multiple, dissimilar UAVs, sensors, and intelligence disciplines.  This sources sought synopsis is a request for information to determine industry and private sector ideas, interests, and technologies to solve current and future UAV and ISR systems interoperability shortfalls.  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be  considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis.  Any cost incurred in responding to this sources sought synopsis will be born by the responders.  SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Industry and academia interested in participating should submit a response (no more than five pages) that identifies their organization as well as the proposed capabilities that could be provided.  Capabilities sought include UAV, sensor, and ISR architecture, including communications, hardware and software and must be mature enough to be easily integrated with other technologies and potentially usable by warfighters when the experiments are concluded.  Due to time sensitivity to define the Extended Awareness experiments and final the schedule of events, responses should be submitted no later than 4:00 PM eastern daylight time, 30 July 2004 to francis.roberts@jfcom.mil.  Responders to this RFI must have background, experience, and understanding of the development of UAVs and ISR systems and architectures.

<RESPDATE>102904
<ARCHDATE>12282004
<CONTACT>Cheryl Miles, 301-619-7148
<DESC>The point-of-contact for this Sources Sought Announcement is MAJ David Shoemaker at david.shoemaker@det.amedd.army.mil.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS IS T O GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF POTENTIAL QUALIFIED SOURCES FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY FOR THE U.S. ARMY MEDICAL MATERIEL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY (USAMMDA), FORT DETRICK, MARYLAND. Its mission is to protect and preserve the lives of America's sons and daughters by provid ing new drugs, vaccines, and medical devices that enhance readiness, ensure the provision of the highest quality medical care to DoD, and maximize the survival rate for medical casualties on the battlefield.  USAMMDA is seeking a Contract Research Organization (CRO) to take 'Real-Time Leishmania PCR' research assays developed by the U.S. military forward for FDA clearance for use on clinical specimens, and ensure that they remain commercially available for use by the U.S. military for a minimum of 5 years.  The Leishmania real-time PCR assays developed by the U.S. military consist of a Leishmania sp. assay, a Leishmania major assay, and a PCR internal control assay for use on the Cepheid SmartCyclerÃ‚Â®.  The CR O would be responsible for producing or subcontracting the production of the assay under the appropriate quality system regulations, to include production of the PCR chemistries, killed Leishmania parasite positive extraction controls, and purified DNA pos itive PCR controls.  This work would also require the growth of the Leishmania parasites (specifically, L. major and L. braziliensis) to produce the extraction controls and positive PCR controls.  Collaborations with USAMMDA would be required for the test and evaluation of these assays to ensure that they meet military requirements.  The FDA-cleared assays must be capable of being used in a CAP/CLIA-certified clinical laboratory.  The CRO would be responsible for conducting or subcontracting the assay valid ation and for preparing a 510(k) application for submission to the FDA.  The CRO must ensure that the FDA-cleared assays remain available for purchase by the U.S. military for at least 5 years once cleared by the FDA.  USAMMDA can envision an approach wher eby the CRO would subcontract various portions of the work, but would remain responsible for the overall management and success of the effort.  USAMMDA would coordinate with the CRO to obtain the appropriate clinical and other critical specimens necessary to conduct the validation studies and to serve as source material to produce the extraction and PCR controls. Ideally the FDA-cleared 510(k) application would be held and managed by the CRO, although consideration could be given to the U.S. Army Medical Re search and Materiel Command holding the application and the CRO managing it.  The CRO should be able to demonstrate that they have the ability and experience to successfully develop an FDA-cleared or approved diagnostic assay.   A short fact sheet (less than 3 pages) is requested that summarizes capabilities of the CRO in completing the requirements identified above.  It is requested the CRO identify what facilities, personnel, and equipment they may have available 'in house' for this effort, and what resources they would have to subcontract for, to include identifying if possible the potential subcontractors and what portion of the work each subcontractor would be responsible for.  It is requested the CRO provide an estimated cost  of any facilities, personnel, and equipment to meet the requirements above. However, this announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made of any  costs to provide information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests. Availability of any formal solicitation will be announced under a separate announcement. This synopsis is for information and plan ning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Each response must reference the sources sought title. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Responses will be held confidential if requested. Please submit f act sheets to the attention of: USAMMDA, ATTN:  MCMR-UMP, 622 Neiman Street, Fort Detrick, MD 21702-5009. Fact sheets may be emailed to: david.shoemaker@det.amedd.army.mil. Responses must be received no later than October 29, 2004, by 4:00 P.M. Eastern Day light Time.

<SUBJECT>B--Review and Analysis Services of Issue Evaluation Studies of Hungry Horse Dam.  Independent review of seismotectonic studies and risk analysis as part of a Consultant Review Board (CRB) for Hungry Horse Dam.
<DESC>Notice of Intent 1.  GENERAL: The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement for Review and Analysis Services to participate as part of a Consulting Review Board (CRB), and to provide review services to Reclamation for Hungry Horse Dam, Hungry Horse Project, Montana.  As part of the CRB, the contractor shall provide an independent review of the seismotectonic studies and analysis and risk analysis activities performed by Reclamation as part of an Issue Evaluation (IE) for the dam. 2. BACKGROUND: 2.1 Hungry Horse Dam is a large concrete gravity arch structure, completed in 1953, on the South Fork of the Flathead River in northwestern Montana.  The dam is over 560 feet high with a crest length of about 2100 feet.  The spillway consists of an inclined shaft connecting to a horizontal tunnel through the right abutment, controlled by a ring gate on the morning-glory spillway inlet structure.  The outlet works consist of three pipes through the right side of the dam.  The powerplant at the toe of the dam contains four turbines, each supplied by a separate penstock constructed through the central portion of the dam. 2.2 The foundation rock is Precambrian dolomite, originally referred to as the Siyeh Limestone (it is now considered part of the Helena Formation, a unit within the middle Proterozoic Belt Supergroup).  The "limestone" at the site contains siliceous, argillaceous, and dolomitic material which makes it hard and insoluble.  The bedding dips about 25 to 30 degrees into the right abutment and slightly upstream.  The bedding planes are planar and continuous, although their surfaces contain ripples and other irregularities that increase the roughness.  Slippage and shearing along some of the bedding planes as the result of the regional folding and tilting is evident from the mapping and explorations.  These shears were termed "bedding plane slips" (BPS) on the geologic maps.  The character of these discontinuities is variable; in some places filled with up to a few inches of clay, in other places filled with crushed and sheared rock, and in other places exhibiting rock to rock contact.  The original designers considered these to be "minor features in the foundation and abutment rock with the exception of one zone containing gouge and clay from 1/16 to 4 inches in thickness".  This exception was termed the "Lift Seam".  Since the mapped descriptions seem rather similar for other bedding plane slips, it is not completely clear why this one was singled out, other than perhaps it was exposed in the dam-foundation footprint and was closest to the dam-foundation contact.   A series of six fault zones oriented roughly upstream-downstream cross the left dam foundation contact between the extreme left end of the dam and the river channel.  Cutoff shafts were excavated along the three largest zones near the upstream and downstream face of the dam, and then backfilled with concrete.  A trench was also excavated and backfilled with concrete along the entire dam-foundation contact.  The Lift Seam extended from Block 8 to Block 13 on the left abutment, and from 11 to 19 feet below the foundation rock surface between Fault Zone No. 3 and Fault Zone No. 4.   2.3 Special treatment was performed for the "Lift Seam".  This consisted of drilling holes on 5-foot centers across the Lift Seam.  Water and air was injected into these holes at pressures less than 30 lb/in2, and vented to adjacent holes.  The washing continued until the vented effluent was clean, and then the seam was grouted from the lower holes continuing to the higher holes, after a thick grout return was noted exiting from holes upslope from the injection point.  After performing this procedure under Block 13, a 36-inch-diameter Calyx hole was drilled to verify the effectiveness of the method.  It was noted that about half of the seam had been washed free of clay and grouted.  A similar procedure was used under Block 12, but upon drilling of another Calyx hole, it was noted, "Grout was found all around the perimeter of the hole, but in laminations with thin layers and lenses of a light tan clay.  The reddish-brown clay had apparently been washed out and replaced by grout."  After trying several additional methods for washing and grouting the seam, the only method that appeared to dislodge additional tan clay material was using a side jet with high pressure (250 lb/in2) water.  This method was continued up to Fault Zone No. 3 (Block 8), where the excavation was deep enough to remove the Lift Seam.  Additional Calyx holes, drilled to check the effectiveness of this method, indicated about 70 to 80 percent of the clay had been replaced by grout. 2.4 Well defined foundation blocks occur in the left abutment, formed by bedding plane "slips" parallel to the abutment, intersecting with fault and shear zones and daylighting in the canyon wall downstream.  Continuous high angle joint sets form release planes for the blocks.  Rigid block static stability analyses of left abutment foundation blocks indicate factors of safety of around 1.5 for normal loading conditions.  The analyses are based on assumed discontinuity friction angles, and foundation uplift forces calculated from the foundation pressure gages and known surface seep locations.  The foundation loads were estimated from structural finite element analyses and applied to the block in an uncoupled calculation. 2.5 Reclamation has performed studies to evaluate the risk associated with Hungry Horse Dam under a variety of different loading conditions.  Based on these studies, the level of risk associated with both static and seismic loading was determined to be above Reclamation guidelines.  The static risk is in the range to take risk reduction action.  Since there is only one static potential failure mode, sliding of the left abutment drives the risk.  It should be noted that the annual failure probability is fairly low, and from a deterministic standpoint, the abutment would likely be considered to meet previously accepted stability criteria.  However, the high structure, large reservoir, and significant consequences drive the risk to an area where further action is justified. The seismic risk is borderline for justification to take expedited action.  This too is driven almost exclusively by the left abutment sliding potential failure mode.  The majority of the risk stems from remote seismic loading (less than 10-5 exceedence probability) associated with the Branciforte earthquake record.  A deterministic approach would not consider events this remote.  If the Branciforte record was not considered, the risk would still be in a range justifying risk reduction actions, driven primarily by the large consequences, although it would be comfortably below the expedited action guideline. 2.6 A review of the analyses performed to identify and evaluate potential failure modes and to estimate their level of risk is now required. 3. CONTRACTOR QUALIFICATIONS:  3.1 30-years experience in hazard and decision analysis as applied to critical facilities 3.2 Must have provided probablisitic seismic hazard and ground motion analysis 3.3 Must have provided seismic source and ground motion characterization. 3.4 Must be capable of development of hazard methodologies. 3.5 Must have provided assessment of potential earthquake hazards for at least 10-existing or proposed dams and or nuclear power plants of similar size as Hungry Horse Dam or larger. 3.6 Must have participated in review boards and provided expert testimony for potential or surface faulting at proposed or existing sites. 3.7 Experience with Reclamation facilities desirable but not necessary. 3.8 Proven expert elicitation in the development of hazard methodologies and uncertainty treatment in performance assessment. 3.9 Developed multiple regional seismic hazard mapping and microzonation studies. 3.10 Documented reports on seismic source and ground motion characterization for risk analysis. 3.11 Ph.D. Geotechnical engineering 3.12 Demonstrated knowledge in the quantitative evaluation of hazard by combining statistical data and expert judgment. 3.13 Demonstrated capability to integrate the fields of earth sciences, hazard analysis and risk assessment. 3.14 Demonstrated capability must be in the form of citable publications. It is Reclamation's belief that Dr. Robert R. Youngs of Geomatrix Consultants, Inc. possesses the above experience and is the only source capable of providing Reclamation with the services required. This is not a formal solicitation.  However, individuals or concerns that respond shall be able to provide proof of their capability to meet the above requirements of the review board member prior to being provided a copy of the solicitation.  This notice may represent the only official notice of such a solicitation.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Request For Information
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) The OCC’s Bank Supervision Systems division is looking for Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software to enhance the capability to meet the formatting requirements of the Financial Institution Data Retrieval System (FINDRS). FINDRS is a web-based reporting application that provides the customer with ad-hoc reports in excel format. Formatting is limited because Excel is not permitted to be run on the IIS server but only on the customer’s desktop. The Microsoft Jet software is currently used to assist in creating the excel report display.  OCC would like to test, for demonstration purposes only, any software that meets or exceeds this request  for a period of no longer than 60 days and no less than 30 days. OCC Environment:  For the FINDRS application the OCC production environment consists of 2 IIS servers (3 cpu’s per IIS server), 1 development IIS server (1 cpu ), 1 maintenance IIS server (1 cpu), 1 preview IIS server (1 cpu) and 1 staging IIS server (1 cpu). 
Information Sought / Technical Capability: 
Ad Hoc Reports 
FINDRS users design these reports on the fly, so we can’t format each report individually because we don’t know what they will contain.  But we do want certain formatting to be applied to all ad hoc reports.
1. Formatting for all ad hoc reports (necessary): Font style = Arial, Font size = 8, Numbers displayed using the 1000 Separator (,), Numbers with decimals displayed as 2 decimals, Font style bold for column headers, Cell shading for column headers, Bottom border for column headers, Wrap Text for Column Headers, AutoFit column width to contents, Right Align Column headers for columns that contain numbers and Left Align column headers for columns that contain text. 2. Other Function: Freeze panes. 3. Summary functions for ad hoc reports: Be able to specify columns to summarize and specify the method used to summarize, e.g., SUM, AVERAGE, MEDIAN, TRIMMEAN, COUNT NUMS, MINIMUM, AND MAXIMUM.  Also specify whether they want the summary on separate worksheet and/or at the end of the data in the column.  
Canned Reports
FINDRS system administrator designs these reports that any user can run.  The system administrator could prepare a sample or a template for each report. 1.Special formatting desired for canned report - Formatting listed above under ad hoc reports plus ability to: Individually format columns in the report (including setting currency formats with 0 decimals, setting number formats with specific decimal places, etc.), Freeze panes at a specific location and Do page setup for printing (including orientation, header, footer, rows to repeat at top and columns to repeat at left, etc.) 2. Functions desired for canned reports (Summary functions listed above for ad hoc reports plus the ability to summarize data using excel pivot table reports and the excel subtotal function.  Would also like the ability to include macros and calculations in the spreadsheet).
Q-CALC Report 1. Formatting functions needed for the Q-CALC Report: A Q-CALC report would require the ability to perform mathematical functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  In addition, it would need to utilize the IF function.  Listed below are the formatting requirements needed to present the report in a format similar to the current report layout.
NUMERIC FORMATTING  
TEXT, GENERAL, NUMBER, CURRENCY, DATE, PERCENTAGE, FRACTION
STYLISTIC FORMATTING FREEZE PANES, FONT, FONT TYPE, FONT STYLE , FONT SIZE, FONT COLOR, CELL HEIGHT AND WIDTH, ROW HEIGHT, COLUMN WIDTH, ALIGNMENT-HORIZONTAL (GENERAL, LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT, FILL, JUSTIFY, CENTER ACROSS SELECTION), VERTICAL (TOP, CENTER, BOTTOM, JUSTIFY), TEXT CONTROL (WRAP TEXT), ORIENTATION, BORDER, BORDER OUTLINE (NONE, OUTLINE), BORDER LINE STYLE, BORDER LINE COLOR, CELL SHADING COLOR, CELL BACKGROUND PATTERN, HORIZONTAL PAGE BREAK, PROTECTION and LOCKED.

<SUBJECT>--Compact, Multiband, Dual-polarization 20/30/44 GHz Satellite Antenna Feed technical information.
<DESC>The Space & Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&TCD) of the Communications, Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Command (CERDEC) intends to make available technical information from Lincoln Laboratory concerning the design of a Co mpact, Multiband, Dual-polarization 20/30/44 GHz Satellite Antenna Feed. This information is available to US-owned businesses only.  Interested companies with capabilities to manufacture or use this antenna feed, including small businesses with appropriate machine shop capability, may respond to this announcement.  A technical information package, including dimension drawings, will be made available to all qualified respondents.  It is anticipated that the technical information package will be available around the end of September 2004. The following information shall be provided by interested organizations as part of their response to this announcement: Ã¢Â€Â“	Company structure Ã¢Â€Â“	Company capabilities, including electromagnetic simulation, manufacturing, and measurement capabilities Ã¢Â€Â“	Related / relevant experience No contract will result from this action in the near future. Please contact Gerald Michael for information.  All interested parties should respond ONLY to: Mr. Gerald T. Michael US Army CERDEC S&TCD ATTN:  AMSRD-CER-ST-SS-TA  (Bldg 210/199) Fort Monmouth, NJ  07703-5302 Gerald.Michael@us.army.mil Background:   The Wideband Tactical Networking Group at MIT Lincoln Laboratory has developed a multiband feed operating at 20/30/44 GHz for insertion into a small communications on the move terminal.  The feed provides dual circularly polarized operation in the 20 and 3 0 GHz bands, and RHCP at 44 GHz in a compact form factor.  Separation of the various frequency bands is also performed, eliminating the need for external diplexers.  The approximate dimensions of the feed are 1 inch in diameter by 5.5 inches long.  It cons ists of three components: the primary radiating structure, a 30/44 GHz dual band polarizer, and a 30/44 GHz diplexing orthomode transducer (OMT).   Two prototypes have been built and combined with a 16 inch diameter axially displaced elliptical (ADE) reflector.  Measured performance is excellent, with 59-69% aperture efficiency at all bands (including all ohmic losses through primary feed, polarizer, and OMT), and axial ratio (averaged over each band) of better than 1 dB.   Tri-band capability has been previously developed at C/X/Ku bands (Shea, et al, Method and Apparatus for Transmitting and Receiving Multiple Frequency Bands Simultaneously, U.S. Patent No. 6,329,957) but is not currently available at K/Ka/Q bands using a s ingle feed.  The work at Lincoln Laboratory was performed to address this need.  Several new concepts were developed in order to accomplish this task, including a tapered dielectric hybrid mode junction and a wideband dielectrically loaded polarizer.  This  allows tri-band operation through a common unloaded circular waveguide section that operates in the fundamental mode at 20 and 30 GHz, but is overmoded at 44 GHz.  The measured characteristics of the current Lincoln Laboratory prototype are as follows: Feed: Frequency bands: 20.2-21.2 GHz, 30.0-31.0 GHz, 43.5-45.5 GHz Return Loss greater than 15 dB over all bands 20 GHz RHCP/LHCP isolation: greater than 14.5 dB 30 GHz RHCP/LHCP isolation: greater than 18 dB 20/30 GHz isolation: greater than 60 dB at each receive port 20/45 GHz isolation: greater than 55 dB at each receive port Reflector: Gain:	36.6 dBi @ 20.7 GHz 	40.2 dBi @ 30.5 GHz 	43.9 dBi @ 44.5 GHz Axial Ratio: Ã¯Â‚Â»1 dB

<DESC>SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION: This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued.  
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)
				2100 Second Street, SW
				Washington, D.C. 20593
				Telephone:   (202) 267-2285

The Request for Proposal number is HSCG89-04-R-6F9007 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-23.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside.  The NAICS is 481212.  The small business sized standard is 1,500 employees.  The contract type will be a firm fixed price contract.  The Government proposes to solicit offers for the following services and quantities:

CONTRACT LINE ITEM NUMBER (CLIN): CLIN 0001 Propane refueling-Two sites; Total Quantity 3,400 gallons.  The locations are: 1) Naked Island, 2,300 gallons; 2) Point Pigot, 1,100 gallons.  CLIN 0002 Propane refueling-Seven sites; Total Quantity 6,800 gallons. The locations are: 1) Robert Barron, 2,200 gallons; 2) Duke Island, 800 gallons; 3) Sukkwan Island, 800 gallons; 4) Cape Fanshaw, 700 gallons; 5) Zarembo Island, 700 gallons; 6) Mt. Mac Arther, 700 gallons; 7) Althorp Peak, 900 gallons.
DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE:  This is a high priority U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue system that must be kept operational at all times to protect property and lives.  The Contractor shall re-fuel two Alaska mountain top high sites with propane in the Valdez area and seven Alaska mountain top high sites with propane in the Juneau area.  The National Voice Distress System Radio sites to be fueled are remote sites that are only accessible by helicopter.  There is no road access to any of these sites and the weather conditions can vary considerably in any season.  Typical transportation of propane to these sites usually includes the use of a barge and/or helicopter.  Normally full pickle barrels are transported by barge to a location near the site and then slung to the mountaintop by a helicopter rated for that load carrying capacity.  A fuel mechanic will then remove the barrel from the sling and transfer the propane to the permanent site-standard (five) 500 Gallon propane tanks.  This process is repeated until all tanks are at maximum capacity.  The contractor shall provide for all services, materials and equipment, personnel, transportation and propane. Contractor shall record and document actual gallons of propane delivered to each site and tank gauge level percentages after filling.  All documentation will be delivered to the Contracting Officer within one week of work completion.
START OF WORK:  Work shall not start before 1 August 2004.
DELIVERY: Services shall be completed for all sites, except Robert Barron, not later than 30 September 2004.  The Robert Barron site shall be refueled no later than 30 August 2004. 
AWARD:  This purchase will be based on the following criteria:  Past performance and technical capability will be evaluated.  All evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price.  Offerors are cautioned that the government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.

<DESC>The Office of Personnel Management has a requirement for the recruitment and screening of Hispanic Americans for referral to the OPM for developmental assignments.  This is in support of an on-going program that is part of the OPM Director’s plans to implement the President’s Executive Order to provide increased employment opportunities for Hispanic Americans in the Federal workplace.  OPM intends to award a fixed-priced bilateral Purchase Order for the 2004 Fall Semester program.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 and 13.106, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation OPM-RFP-04-00031TLA is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14.  The North American Industry Classification System code for this procurement is 541612 and the small business standard is 6.0 million per year.

ESTIMATED NUMBER OF INTERNS: 5-10

CONTRACT LINE ITEM NUMBERS (CLINS)

CLIN 0001: Recruitment, Screening, Placement and Support 
Services.  CLIN 0002: Travel*				      

*Travel will be billed at actual cost if different from estimated cost.  

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT  

The contractor will be responsible for the following services:

1.  Recruitment - The contractor will attract a qualified pool of applicants through a campaign of recruitment visits to Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), targeted direct mailings, attendance at conferences, responses to inquires, and an informational HNIP web page.  

2.  Employment Administration- The contractor will receive and process applications. The contractor will match student applications with intern assignments provided by OPM, process payroll, coordinate periodic performance evaluations, and provide guidance and support for the interns over the course of the assignment.  As contractor employees, students will be paid a stipend based on their academic level according to a predetermined rate.

3.  Orientation - The contractor will conduct orientation activities in Washington, D.C., the weekend before interns report to their assignments.  The first day of work will be typically designated as a general introduction to OPM.

4.  Extra Curricular Activities - The contractor will organize a series of meetings that will enhance the intern’s professional experience and provide them with additional networking opportunities.  In addition, the contractor will arrange for students to attend a minimum of three (3) of the following cultural tours: the White House, Pentagon, FBI, Capitol, Library of Congress, and Government Printing Office.  The cultural tours will be arranged during all 3 sessions: spring, summer, and fall.

5.  Academic Credit - Students will have the opportunity to receive academic credit while working in the program.  Students must work to obtain approval from their academic advisor or dean.  While this may not be possible in some cases, we anticipate that the majority of the semester-long interns will receive credit for their internship experience, as this is a priority to OPM.  The contractor will notify and work with students and their academic advisor or deans to ensure that appropriate documentation and procedures are in place to allow the home institution to award credit.                                                                                                                 

6.  Student and Supervisor Support Services - The contractor will provide support services that include program handbooks, regular written updates, and information about career and educational opportunities.  In addition, the contractor staff will conduct site visits and maintain frequent communication by phone, newsletters, e-mails and fax.

7.  Housing -The contractor will assist interns in arranging safe, furnished, affordable housing near public transportation that will be accessible to OPM work locations.  In case of field placements, the contractor will work with OPM supervisors to meet the above stated criteria.

8.  Travel - The contractor will provide round-trip transportation to all interns.

9.  Evaluation - The contractor will conduct a complete program evaluation at the end of the program and submit a final report to OPM.  The report will include feedback from interns as well as supervisors.
  
PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  120 days from date of award.

POSITION TITLE:  		Democracy and Governance Advisor

INTRODUCTION

The USAID Mission for Ethiopia manages the overall U.S. assistance program for Ethiopia. This program provides support in the areas of public health and HIV/AIDS, rural economic growth and agricultural development, food security, basic education support, and democracy/ governance.

USAID/Ethiopia¡¦s Democracy and Governance Strategic Objective (SO 5): ¡§Capacity for Good Governance Increased.  ¡¨ is designed to foster and reinforce democratic institutions and practices, and improve governance at the local and national levels through an informed and more participatory Ethiopian population.  The Democracy and Governance Strategic Objective includes four intermediate results: 
 
IR 1. Accountability by Regional and Local Governments Improved;
IR 2. Civil Society Capacity to Engage Government Strengthened;
IR 3. Mechanisms for Conflict Prevention and Resolution Improved; and
IR 4. Women¡¦s Participation in Political Processes Expanded and Enhanced.

The Mission¡¦s five-year Integrated Strategic Plan was approved in March 2004.  While IR 1 and IR 3 are funded, the Mission currently has not yet received funding for IRs 2 and 4.  These IRs will most likely be resourced from Economic Support Funds (ESF), subject to availability of funding.  The Mission expects to receive ESF for an intensive civil society-based elections support program that will support IRs 2 and 4. The elections support will be implemented in close collaboration with the US Embassy and span approximately one year.   Parliamentary elections are expected to be held in Ethiopia in May or June 2005.   The Mission will focus on support to civil society organizations to conduct elections outreach and to increase political dialogue on key public policy issues.

SECTION III.  SCOPE OF WORK

The fire department currently has a Telecor CS100 with Multi-Zone Paging System.  The current system is limited on tone control for each zone.  We would like the new system to allow independent control of tone and volume, controlled to each individual zone to equalize to the most optimum levels.  The new system also needs to be mirrored for the right and left side of the control room; the current system is limited to one side of the room.  The system would need a complete change in wiring and speakers.  

SECTION IV.  GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIALS

1.	No government-furnished materials will be provided for this project.
   
2.	The contractor shall furnish all labor and materials, appliances, tools, equipment, facilities, transportation and services necessary for and incidental to perform all operations accomplishment of project.

MEMORANDUM FOR: 366 CONS/LGCB
                                               
FROM:  366 CES/CEF

SUBJECT:  Public Address System

1.	The following will be needed for improving the Fire Departments Public Address system:

a.	A second public address console needs to be installed for the additional dispatcher; this will allow operators to control two emergencies simultaneously.  
b.	Speakers need to be engineered in the Fire Alarm Control Center allowing pages throughout the fire department to be heard.  
c.	Additional speakers will be needed outside the station and in vehicle bays.  Exitisting speakers are inefficient and unreliable.
d.	A total of 101 speakers to include wiring will need to be replaced.

2.	The current system is capable of paging from any phone inside station.  These phones override the pages made by the fire alarm control center. This has caused problems in the past because emergency dispatch information was lost due to overrides.  The new system will need to change this making the fire alarm control center override any other pages made inside the station.

6		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

Demand in the Czech Republic’s IT sector continues to grow at a healthy pace, although the pace has slowed in recent years.  The IT market grew 3.8% in 2001 and 3.6% in 2002 and was estimated at $1.7 billion in 2002, according to U.S. Commercial Service reports.  The Czech Republic already spends 4% of GDP on the information technology sector, which is higher than any of its Central European neighbors and higher than the European Union average of 3.3%.  Information technology is increasingly being employed to create efficiencies in the Czech health sector. 

The Czech healthcare sector is primarily state-owned and state-run.  There is compulsory health insurance, primarily through the state-owned General Health Insurance Fund of the Czech Republic (VZP), which covers approximately 7 million of the Czech Republic’s 10 million inhabitants.  VZP is funded from contributions by the government, individuals and employers.  Healthcare is provided by both the public sector and the private sector.  Hospitals are mainly state-owned (either at the regional or federal level), whereas other care is primarily provided by private sector physicians.

VZP requires a feasibility study on its priority IT project.  VZP is planning to install a new system for determining reimbursement payments.  Instead of the current hodgepodge of methods of determining reimbursement amounts, including per capita, payment for performance, lump-sum payment and combinations of these methods, the system would be changed to a risk-based compensation system.  In many cases, VZP is paying hospitals based on historical formulas of a lump sum with 2% increases every year, regardless of the extent of care or the quality of care that is provided.  There are also considerable differences in payments between similar health care providers with the same caseload, expertise, and quality of care that are more based on a historical cost of the institution providing the care rather than on a competitive price.  For example, teaching hospitals are paid considerably more to cover their higher costs (due to teaching) even though the care provided is comparable to care at other hospitals. 

The proposed new payment system would greatly reduce economic inefficiencies by defining a basket of guaranteed care and a risk compensating system reflecting specific diagnoses and procedures.  In order to accomplish this, VZP would use a medical classification and cost allocation system developed by 3M of Maplewood, MN.  3M has developed and implemented classification systems for key segments of health care in the U.S. on a nationwide basis.  A similar system would be introduced in the Czech Republic and would enable VZP to introduce the standard activity based costing method of efficiency measurement (which is routinely used in industry) into the health care system.  

In addition, the DM consultant will examine a project to introduce “Smart Cards” to the Czech health sector by the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic.  This project would involve using Smart Cards with electronic signature technology in health care billing and transactions.  The Smart Cards would be issued to every insurance policyholder of the Czech Republic.  The cards would include basic identification as well as potentially other patient information.  The Ministry of Health would work with all insurance companies to implement the project.  Smart Cards would allow for secure and trackable medical delivery transactions and would reduce fraud, waste, and abuse through better monitoring of health care expenditures.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NUMBER 2 -
ANNEX I


Guidance for DM/DS Contractors

USTDA has a dual mission of promoting US exports and advancing economic development in the host country.  In the past, the Agency has asked DM and DS contractors to write Terms of Reference for Feasibility Studies, Technical Assistance and other grants that primarily addressed the commercial side of the program.  However, USTDA is now placing more focus on the Agency’s developmental mandate.  Therefore, it is necessary to include a development impact (DI) task in the terms of reference for the DS/DM work.  A critical component of this work on the Development Impact will be to include a section on the same subject when the DM/DS contractors develop the terms of reference for the proposed feasibility study or technical assistance activity.  


What Categories of Developmental Impact Should I Address in the DM or DS?

Your DM/DS report should include a general, order-of-magnitude description of the project’s potential development impact in the following areas:

Category	Explanation
Infrastructure & Industrialization	USTDA funds feasibility studies of many critically important infrastructure projects such as power plants, roads, ports, airports, telecommunications systems, water and sewerage systems or environmental improvements or enhancements, as well as industrial projects such as refineries and manufacturing plants.  Implementation of these projects contributes to the improvement and security of the physical, financial and social infrastructure of the developing world.  
Market-Oriented Reforms	Many USTDA projects have as a primary objective the facilitation of market-oriented reforms in developing countries. These reforms include encouraging more transparent regulatory systems and institutions, privatization of state-owned economic entities, promotion of greater competition in non-competitive economic sectors, lowering of non-tariff barriers to trade, strengthening of intellectual property rights and modernizing international trade systems and regulations.  
Human Capacity Building	When implemented, the agency’s projects often create new job opportunities, sustain employment for those in jeopardy of losing jobs and/or offer advanced training to upgrade the capability of the work force.  USTDA considers a project to have Human Capacity Building impact if ten or more jobs are created and/or ten or more people receive significant training.
Technology Transfer and Productivity Improvement	The introduction of advanced technologies (e.g. management information systems or process technologies) or licenses.  The improvement of processes and/or systems that stimulate greater economic productivity or allow more efficient use of resources.
Other	Other development benefits not captured by the above four categories-examples include enhanced government revenue or spin-off projects.


How Should the TOR of the FS/TA Address Development?

The TOR should include a task that assesses the expected development benefits of the proposed project:

The FS/TA Contractor shall report on the potential developmental impact of the project in the host country.  In this section, the FS/TA Contractor should focus on what the economic development outcomes will be if the project is implemented according to the study recommendations.    While specific focus should be paid to the immediate impact of the specific project that is being considered, the FS/TA contractor should include, where appropriate, any additional developmental benefits to the project, including spin-off and demonstration effects.  The analysis of potential benefits of the feasibility study contractor should be as concrete and detailed as possible.  The FS/TA contractor will provide estimates of the project’s potential benefits in the following areas: 

·	Infrastructure & Security: a statement on the infrastructure impact giving a brief synopsis.  For example “This project would result in the construction of a power plant that would provide 500MW of power.  This plant would serve x additional households in the region.”

·	Market Oriented Reform: a description of any regulation, laws, or institutional changes that are recommended and the effect they would have if implemented..

·	Human Capacity Building:  The Contractor should address the number and type of positions that would be needed to construct and operate the proposed project as well as the number of people who will receive training and a brief description of the training program.

·	Technology Transfer and Productivity Enhancement: a description of any advanced technologies that will be implemented as a result of the project.  A description of any efficiency that will be gained (e.g. “By building a new port with a capacity of x, y hours of delays in shipping could be eliminated).

·	Other: any other developmental benefits to the project, including any spin-off or demonstration effects.

 
How Will This Affect the Final Report For the FS or TA Project?  

·	A section in the final report will be devoted to the projected host country development impacts of the FS project or TA recommendations if they are implemented.  The section should focus primarily on the key issues mentioned above (infrastructure and industrialization, human capacity building, technology transfer and productivity, and market oriented reform).  Other host country development impacts (e.g. improved financial revenue flows to host government etc.) can be mentioned where appropriate.  The discussion should be as detailed and concrete as possible, and the contractor may provide estimates in ranges as appropriate.
