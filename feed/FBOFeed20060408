<SOLNBR>N0002406R4206
<CONTACT>Tara Borntreger 202-781-3390 Timothy Starker 202-781-3944
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to procure main gas turbine generator (MTG) sets for the DD(X) Destroyer program on a firm-fixed price (FFP) basis.  The MTG sets shall be capable of providing power for ship propulsion and for shipboard electrical power conversion for use by shipboard loads.  The MTG set shall be designed, constructed, tested and certified in accordance with the requirements of the American Bureau of Shipbuilding (ABS) Naval Vessel Rules (NVR) and the DD(X) Design, Build and Process (DB&P) specification.  The minimum output power from each MTG set shall be 36MWe at the standard rating conditions defined in ABS NVR. This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) site at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) site at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitiations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Offerors may utilize either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.  Some technical specifications (including Attachments A and B) to this solicitation include a "Distribution Statement D" marking, meaning access is restricted to DoD and DoD contractors only.  In order to control access to these documents, they can only be received by written email request to tara.borntreger@navy.mil, with justification provided as to the parties need to know and purpose of the request.   This procurement will include a basic requirement for MTG set non-recurring engineering (detail design, interface definition, software development, certification, etc.), with five (5) FFP MTG set options, for a total of 10 MTG sets, that may be exercised during the five-year period of the contract, and associated engineering services.   This announcement supersedes the previously posted announcement N0002406R2308 for DD(X) main gas turbine engines.  No industry day is planned for this procurement.  A draft solicitation is being released with this announcement in FBO for industry review and comment.  In addition to comments on the general content of the scope and technical requirements, a review of the requirements should include the identification of cost drivers, including rough estimates of cost impact, so the Navy may conduct a trade off analysis of performance versus cost drivers prior to releasing the final RFP.  To maintain progress on the ship design, the solicitation may include a request for Early Vendor Information (EVI), that the Navy intends to provide the DD(X) shipbuilders prior to MTG set contract award.  Industry is requested to comment on warranty provisions and make recommendations on how to preserve a useful warranty period, given the MTG set will be installed but light off may not occur !  for up to two years.  Industry comment on the feasibility of this warranty period is requested.  Industry comments are requested no later than April 20, 2006.  A competitive solicitation is expected to be issued shortly thereafter.  All inquiries should be emailed to tara.borntreger@navy.mil.

<DESC>The National Institutes of health (NIH), National Institute of Child and Human Development (NICHD) intends to procure on a sole source basis with David Todem to develop statistical and methodological methods in Perinatal Health. Also, the contractor shall consider both parametric, semiparametric and nonparametric statistical models needed to understand the relationship between pregnancy outcomes (Preeclampsia, Small neonates for gestational age, and Uncomplicated pregnancies) and prenatal biologic analytes (VEGFR-1, PIGF, and s-eng Endoglin) measured over time. Parametric models will include both linear and nonlinear models. Specifically, the Contractor shall use parametric growth curve models (mixed-effects models, nonlinear mixed effects models and population-averaged models) to understand the relationship between pregnancy outcomes viewed as covariates and prenatal biologic analytes viewed as responses. To increase efficiency, the Contractor shall consider model-based standard errors after a careful modeling of the association structure in the data. Other parametric model shall include prediction models based on polytomous logistic regression for identifying patients with the clinical disease, using either each analyte, and as well as a combination of analytes viewed as covariates.  Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) shall also be constructed and classification matrices generated. The contractor shall use semiparametric models that use robust “Sandwich” estimators to estimate the standard errors of the parameter estimates when the association structure in the data is misspecified. Nonparametric models will include descriptive tools such as spline models and explanatory tools such as regression trees and classification trees for longitudinal data. It is common that in medical research, with the current technology, a level of some analytes may be detectable only above a threshold level. A good example in the database available at the Branch is the PlGF analyte, which is only measured above some threshold value. The Contractor shall then consider a piece-wise growth curve model or any other novel tool to adequately capture this feature of the data.  The Contractor shall check all model fits for individual and systematic departures of the observed and fitted values using informal (e.g. inspection of residuals) and formal methods (e.g. based on Wald, Likelihood ratio and score tests for extra parameters). If individual outliers are detected, their influence will be evaluated by comparing models with and without outlying values. When we are not successful in fitting the parametric model, then non parametric methods such as generalized additive models shall be utilized. To minimize bias in the prediction model, the Contractor shall consider a cross-validation method by splitting the original data into a training sample (about 3/4 of data) and a testing set (about 1/4).  
Contractor will provide the background and reasoning for using a particular method of analyzing the data.  Contractor will provide the PRB with references for the method(s) chosen.  Contractor shall utilize updated versions of software packages that he/she considers most appropriate for the type of data handled. In addition the Contractor shall consider programming new methodologies and models using matrix oriented-software packages as these new models may not be fitted using commercial software packages. Contractor will perform intensive computation, including bootstrapping and permutation, for statistical hypothesis testing.  The Contractor shall provide administrative support for the research projects such as typing of statistical reports and submissions for publications; literature searches and collection of scientific papers; copying of scientific papers; maintaining and updating a computerized reference library (e.g. EndNote). Work is to be performed by Contractor both at the PRB site at Wayne State University and at Contractor’s own location. To function effectively, the PRB will hold frequent meetings input from, and collaboration with, its Cooperative Group partners and other stakeholders. The Contractor shall attend in-person onsite monthly meetings organized by the head of PRB or his designee at the PRB premises, for an overview of the conduct of the project. In addition, the Contractor shall organize and coordinate in-person weekly meetings (preferably on Fridays) on methodological and statistical issues of the project in collaboration with the PRB project director or designee. The Contractor should be a member of a task specific panel made of all consultants that offer statistical advice and reviews about all aspects of PRB statistical operations. Areas in which this task-specific panel would be of value include, study design, data management and analysis, and interpretation of results. This panel will primarily meet every week in person, although the PRB may elect, in addition, to host conference call meetings to minimize costs for in-person meetings.  By  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 22 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries may be directed to Patricia Haun via email:  haunp@mail.nih.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- Notice of Intent to Award Contract to Mitretek Systems for Technical Support in Evaluation of Biometric Identification and Verification Standards
<DESC>Under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(1) and 41 USC 253(c)(3), the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, on behalf of the NIST Information Technology Laboratory’s (ITL) Information Access Division (IAD), intends to negotiate and award a five-year, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) task order type contract with a ceiling amount of $2 million to Mitretek Systems (“Mitretek”), 7572 Colshire Drive, Falls Church, Virginia 22102.  The scope of the IDIQ contract will be technical support in evaluation of biometric identification and verification standards, which may include fingerprint matching systems (rolled, flat, latent, live-capture), face recognition systems, iris recognition systems, and/or multimodal biometrics systems (including fingerprint).  Such support will require expert-level technical support to NIST in technology evaluation, development of methodology and metrics, and recommendations to NIST.

BACKGROUND:

NIST was mandated by the federal USA Patriot Act to develop and certify a standard for verifying the identity of persons applying for a visa or seeking to enter the United States of America be developed and certified, and providing technical support to the United States Attorney General and the United States Secretary of State in evaluation of biometric identification systems for Entry and Exit Data System for borders of the United States of America.  NIST ITL IAD has served the central role in this requirement.  Other agencies, including the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) (including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)), have sought technical guidance from NIST ITL IAD in research and evaluations of biometric systems which may be considered for homeland security.   Due to the urgency of these homeland security requests, along with the sporadic nature of other agency funding, it was determined that NIST ITL IAD needed to contract to obtain technical support for some of its tasks in biometics.

CONSTRAINTS:

NIST requires that the Contractor for the aforementioned types of work not have any conflicting role that could potentially bias its judgment in carrying out tasks under its contracts, and that the Contractor not be in a position to gain or be perceived as gaining an unfair competitive advantage as a result of work performed under the contract.  This applies not only to the Contractor but to any other organization that has or is perceived to have a business relationship with the Contractor that may lead to a potential conflict of interest.

PROCUREMENT HISTORY:

Since 2000, NIST ITL IAD has contracted for technical support in biometrics, research study, and computer security from Mitretek Systems (“Mitretek”) of Falls Church, Virginia using several different procurement mechanisms since NIST concluded for each of those needs that contracting with Mitretek was NIST’s only reasonable alternative to satisfy its requirements with a non-governmental source that possessed no potential conflicts of interest.  Mitretek is a 501(c)(3) corporation chartered to work exclusively in the public interest.  As stated in its articles of incorporation, the nature of Mitretek’s business is exclusively charitable, educational, and scientific.  Its primary purpose is to carry on scientific research in the public interest in order to provide a public benefit through the application of science and technology.  Mitretek has no stockholders, but is administered as a public trust by a board of trustees made up of eminent citizens. Mitretek, as a nonprofit corporation chartered to work exclusively in the public interest, operates in a manner that meets the spirit and specific requirements of the conflict of interest avoidance criteria stated above.  Mitretek does not manufacture or promote any commercial products, does not provide routine services, and does not work for or formally compete against profit-seeking firms.  In addition to the above safeguards against organizational conflict of interest, Mitretek has in place corporate policies and procedures that guard against individual trustees, officers, and employee personal interests conflicting with Mitretek’s work.

NIST ITL IAD’S CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS:

NIST ITL IAD continues to have a need for long-term contract support for expertise in biometrics identification and verification systems from a source that has hands-on experience using DOJ FBI’s Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) fingerprint matching system and the DHS US Visitor and Immigrant Status Indication Technology (US VISIT) System.  NIST’s recent market research indicates that Mitretek continues to remain the only apparent non-governmental source that can fulfill those requirements in a non-partial manner without any potential conflicts of interest.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541710, and the size standard is 500 employees.

NIST AMD’S INTENT:

For the reasons noted above, NIST AMD intends to negotiate and award a sole source IDIQ contract worth up to $2 million over 5 years to Mitretek.  This notice of intent to award the aforementioned IDIQ contract to Mitretek is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, if responses are submitted from non-governmental entities in response to this notice that CLEARLY AND UNAMBIGUOUSLY DEMONSTRATE their capability to satisfy NIST's requirements while at the same time maintaining impartiality and presenting no potential financial or other conflicts of interest, NIST AMD will consider those responses solely for the purpose of determining whether NIST AND could compete this requirement.  SUCH RESPONSES MUST BE SUBMITTED BY EMAIL TO JOSEPH.WIDDUP@NIST.GOV WITH A COURTESY COPY TO MICHAEL.SZWED@NIST.GOV AND MUST BE RECEIVED AT THOSE EMAIL ADDRESSES NO LATER THAN APRIL 25, 2006.  The determination whether NIST AMD could compete the IDIQ contract requirement will be made solely at NIST AMD’s discretion.
