<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6 and Part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number DG133R-05-RP-1183 is issued as a request for proposals and is solicited under full and open competition. The NAICS Code is 541330. 

The DOC/NOAA, Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR) is seeking research and design  engineering and fabrication services for the NOAA scientific Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) system for installation on the NOAA vessel(formerly known as the U.S.N.S. Capable.)  This requires the design, fabrication and installation of the ROV.  The government has budgeted $3,000,000.00 for 24 months.

The ROV design characteristics should support scientific missions of exploration and research similar to those already undertaken by NOAA/OAR. These include inspection and interaction with both the seafloor and the midwater environments. Intervention tasks may engage both horizontal (e.g. seafloor) and vertical (e.g. shelf walls) surfaces. Proposals should identify how their designs accommodate scientific missions.  See the attached Statement of Work.

The solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) Number 2005-04. The provisions and clauses may be downloaded at http://www.acqnet.gov/far. The following provisions and clauses shall apply to this solicitation: 

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition and there is no addenda to this provision; 
FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items - The Government will award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offer or whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered;

52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration; 
52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; 
52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era; 
52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; 
52.222-37, Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans for the Vietnam Era; 52.232-1, Payments; 
52.232-38, Submission of Electronic Funds Transfer Information with Offer;
52.249-2, Termination for Convenience of the Government (Fixed Price) (Short Form); and,
52.246-24, Limitation of Liability – High –Value Items.

The proposal shall include an approach; how the work will be performed and managed, three(3) past performance citations of relevant quality work performed, and a firm fixed price in accordance with the payment schedule (see the attached Statement of Work). The evaluation factors are approach, past performance, and price, and include:

1.  Design team qualifications – demonstrated experience in the development and operation of scientific ROVs.

2. Past Performance of the base ROV design - success of earlier vehicle(s).

3.  Familiarity with NOAA’s Office of Ocean Exploration (OE).  Previous experience working with OE will be regarded highly as OE’s technical and operations staff expects to work closely with the ROV design team throughout the project.

A firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) to attend the PAAS Presolicitation Conference, no exceptions. Attendance is limited to 5 individuals per firm due to limited seating. There is no fee to attend this conference, and lunch is not provided.  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code expected to be applicable to this acquisition is 541330 using the exception for engineering services on military and aerospace equipment and military weapons with a size standard of $23 million.  

The all-day PAAS Presolicitation Conference will be held on 29 Jun 2005.  Sign-in will begin at 8:00 a.m., with the conference beginning promptly at 8:30 a.m. (central time) at Bldg 775, 2601 Louis Bauer Drive, Brooks City-Base, TX.  The Presolicitation Conference is an opportunity to bring interested businesses together to hear from the Contracting Officer and Senior Program Officials about the acquisition of advisory and assistance services, which encompass management and professional studies, analyses and evaluations, and engineering and technical support to supplement government organic resources in support of the Headquarters Human Systems Group (HSG), 311th Human Systems Wing (HSW), and Brooks City-Base (BCB) tenant organizations.  It is our intent that businesses network and explore possible teaming or joint venture arrangements with other firms as well as potential subcontracting opportunities during break periods. The session will also assist AF acquisition professionals and program officials to gauge the level of interest by small businesses in the various socioeconomic categories, particularly Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.  Offerors should submit questions regarding the Draft RFP that they would like to be addressed at the Presolicitation Conference to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Richard Williams at richard.williams@brooks.af.mil no later than 21 Jun 05. Questions arising at the Presolicitation Conference must be submitted in writing, and all questions and answers will be posted on the febbizopps website following the conference. This presolicitation announcement is not a contract, or a request for proposals, or a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind. The AF will NOT assume liability for costs incurred by any offeror for travel expenses, presentations, marketing efforts, or any data offered for examination; therefore, the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.  The PAAS acquisition strategy has not been finalized at this time. The AF anticipates soliciting for these requirements in July/August 2005.     

Conference participants will not be allowed to use recordable media, cell phones, palm pilots, laptops, etc. during the sessions. To enter base, a driver’s license, a picture ID for all vehicle occupants, proof of vehicle insurance, and admittance letter signed by the government contracting office are required.  Firms need to preregister for this event and request this admittance letter by email.  The request should include the name of the firm, business address, attendees’ full names, and a point of contact, email address, and phone number. Interested parties should register with Lora Rodriquez or Carol Estes by email no later than 22 Jun 2005.  Email addresses are lora.rodriquez@brooks.af.mil or carol.estes@brooks.af.mil. After you preregister, you will receive the admittance letter, a map, and additional details regarding the conference.  Additionally, visitors may be required to go through a security screening check point on the base. 

If you plan on attending the Presolicitation Conference, the only gate for visitors is the gate at Henderson Court (which is off South Presa Street or Old Corpus Christi Road).   Due to construction, there is no access on Southwest Military Drive for non-government ID card holders.   Please be advised that traffic may be backed up due to ID checks at the gate, so allow for gate delays in processing ID checks and time for sign-in at the auditorium, as the Presolicitation Conference will start promptly at 8:30 a.m.

<DESC>CDC, NIOSH, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory intend to issue a request for quotation (RFQ) to provide engineering services to assist in the development of a test protocol, execution of the test protocol at NIOSH's Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL), documentation of the test results, and submission of the test report and supporting documentation. 

Background and Need

Many of the electrocution deaths in the construction, mining and other industries arise when employees bring high reaching mobile equipment, such as mobile cranes, dump bed trucks, and drill rigs into contact with overhead power lines.  During a recent ten year period, approximately 20% of electrocution deaths could be attributed to contact between high reaching mobile equipment and overhead power lines.  Proximity warning systems, advertised to be able to alert operators when they approach too close to a power line, have been commercially available for 30 years.  Such systems have not found widespread acceptance in industry due perceived performance deficiencies and, in part, to a lack of regulatory requirements.  The only known comprehensive study of power line proximity warning systems was published by the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1982.  It documented some serious performance limitations.  Proximity warning system manufacturers claim to have substantially improved product performance since then.  In addition, recent OSHA efforts are underway to improve the 29CFR Crane and Derrick Standard.  The proposed language allows the use of proximity warning systems as a means of maintaining OSHA’s required clearance distances from power lines, provided such systems are approved by a nationally recognized testing laboratory.  To allow approval by a third party testing laboratory, objective data must exist from which to develop a standard for use by such laboratories.  NIOSH plans to undertake such work via this solicitation.  OSHA, the International Union of Operating Engineers AFL-CIO, and equipment manufacturers have expressed interest in such a standard.  This work will establish the basis for such a national standard and it supports proposed OSHA regulations that call for the use of overhead power line proximity warning alarms as an alternate means of preventing power line electrocution.

Scope of Work

The vendor will provide the technical oversight, expertise and labor to complete the following tasks:

1.	The selected vendor will participate, along with technical representatives of NIOSH, OSHA, manufacturers of power line proximity warning alarms, labor groups, and other interested parties, in the development of a test protocol.  The first meeting will take place approximately 30 days after the award at the PRL.  Several subsequent teleconferences and email will be used to minimize travel expenses.  The protocol should be completed within 120 days after award. 



2.	The selected vendor will interface as needed with the Government’s Project Officer and/or his representative to provide test facility design recommendations to NIOSH.  NIOSH will construct, at Government expense, an outdoor test facility at PRL that can serve as a standard overhead power line test area for current (and future) power line proximity system evaluations.  The first interface teleconference will take place within two weeks of the award and as needed thereafter.  The facility design will be finalized within 90 days after award.  

3.	The selected vendor will execute the performance tests, per the test protocol developed in Item 1, at the Government-supplied outdoor facility including directing a Government-supplied crane operator, interfacing with the proximity warning system manufacturer’s engineers, and ensuring site safety for all personnel involved.  The vendor will supply all instrumentation and equipment not specifically called out as Government supplied in Section V, below.

4.	At the conclusion of the tests, the selected vendor will submit an objective draft report to NIOSH that describes tests results for of each product tested.  In addition, the selected vendor will make recommendations for important performance and construction characteristics of proximity warning systems that should be considered in a future standards document.  The draft report graphics should be prepared to adequately describe the test setup, equipment, test results, and recommendations.  These recommendations should consider input from manufacturers, labor, industry groups, and OSHA, and NIOSH.  The vendor should expect (and budget) to make one revision to the draft report after issue.

5.	Upon approval of the draft report by NIOSH, a final report shall be provided by the vendor within 13 months of award.

MINIMUM VENDOR QUALIFICATIONS

1.	The vendor’s proposal must show evidence of knowledge regarding the complex electric field distribution around single and multiple power line sets, a basic understanding of power line proximity warning alarm systems, a basic understanding of safe working practices around energized power lines, and demonstrate efficient use of time and personnel.  The vendor's  proposal must state that they are available to travel as needed to PRL (suburban Pittsburgh, PA area) to fulfill the requirements of the protocol development and the proposed test program. 

2.	The vendor’s Project Officer shall be qualified to practice electrical engineering by training and experience closely related to the requirements of this project.  He/she should have demonstrated experience electrical field testing.  Other proposed personnel should be qualified by appropriate training and experience to assist the vendor’s Project Officer.  The vendor shall supply a Curriculum Vitae for each person proposed for the project as part of the proposal. 

3.	The vendor shall document experience in projects similar to this proposed effort.  Such documented experience should show evidence of participation in consensus test or standards development, field testing and evaluation, and report documentation.  Consideration shall be given to recent corporate participation and thr role (Chairman, committee member, consultant, etc.) played by the vendor's proposed Project Officer in similar consensus test or standards development programs.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego), in support of the Program Executive Officer for Littoral and Mine Warfare, PMS 420 and PMS 485, is soliciting innovative research and development proposals of multiple mechanical/ocean engineering concepts for automated deployment, recovery and operation of linear, towed arrays of hydrophones and vertical arrays of acoustic sources from small craft (e.g., 11 m Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat (RHIB)), on the littoral ocean bottom, and from high-speed, non- dedicated surface ships.  Different military ships can be considered but Surveillance Towed Array (SURTASS) Ships or the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) or small boats launched from LCS are of most interest to the Navy.  The areas of interest include: (1) compact, low frequency acoustic source arrays; (2) deployment and retrieval mechanisms; (3) innovative packaging; (4) power electronics (amplifiers, energy storage); (5) power systems for the lightweight towed arrays; (6) various material storage and handling systems; (7) associated control systems and software to support sensors and unmanned operation; and (8) adaptations of small craft design which may better support such sensor systems SSC San Diego, in support of the Program Executive Officer for Littoral and Mine Warfare, PMS 420 and PMS 485, is similarly soliciting innovative research and development proposals to explore use of a small surface craft to deploy and operate undersea acoustic sensors.  The challenges presented by undersea threats provide the impetus for the development of deployable and off-board acoustic surveillance systems which are networked, distributed, and multistatic-capable, such as Advanced Deployable System (ADS), Fixed Distributed System (FDS), and Deployable Autonomous Distributed Systems (DADS).  The very low noise levels associated with modern submarines are a significant challenge for passive systems and a natural augmentation of such systems is the addition of an acoustic source.  In addition to working with the deployed systems, the active signals from such sources could also be received and processed by surface ships with towed arrays.  In this context an active system has the potential for significant improvement in coverage against a quiet target over a purely passive system.  An additional benefit for acoustic sources deployed from small craft or unmanned surface vessels (USVs) is that this eliminates the vulnerability associated with operating an acoustic source from a large vessel (beaconing).  Operation from a small craft pose several challenges including: (1) dynamics of a small craft from the standpoints of deployment and recovery of a low frequency active array; (2) shock and vibration effects associated with high speed transit of small craft; (3) energy storage and management; (4) high efficiency, high power density amplifiers and transducers; and (5) power plant sizing to maximize mission performance. This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016. Awards may take the form of procurement contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transaction agreements, as appropriate.  Awards will only be made for basic research, applied research, or development that is not related to the development of a specific system. Awards will not be made for commercial or non-developmental items.  Award decisions will be based on a competitive selection of proposals resulting from a peer and/or scientific review.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  The Government may also only select specific tasks within a proposal for award.  No additional request for proposal (RFP), solicitation or other announcement of this opportunity will be made.  It is estimated that three awards may be made as a result of this announcement with approximate ceiling amounts of $1,000,000 each.  Proposals are sought now for award and work of efforts in late FY05 and FY06. Contractors are invited to submit cost and technical proposals for one or more of the above areas.  Proposals are due no later than 15:00 Pacific Daylight Saving Time on 11 July 2006; however, those proposals which are received by 15:00 Pacific Daylight Saving Time on 11 August 2005 will have the greatest chance of being funded.  Proposals must be submitted electronically to the SPAWAR e-Commerce Central website at https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil. Click on SSC San Diego and then Open BAA.  Additional submission instructions are available at the website under Submitting a Proposal? The cost proposal shall be prepared in accordance with the two documents at the website titled Cost Proposal Instructions and Cost Proposal Sample Spreadsheet.  There is no page limitation for the cost proposal. The technical proposal shall not exceed twenty (20) pages in length, single- sided on 8 ½ by 11-inch paper.  The technical proposal shall be structured to address the following items, in the stated order: (1) BAA topic area addressed by proposal; (2) summary of key elements within proposal; (3) ability of proposed work to satisfy BAA goals; (4) detailed explanation of proposed work, technical approach, critical issues, etc.; (5) schedule and milestones; (6) explanation of all deliverables, with identification of any data, information or software deliverables that would be provided to the Government with other than unlimited rights; (7) self-evaluation of proposal against the BAA evaluation factors; and (8) explanation of how the proposed effort satisfies the definition (s) of basic research, applied research, or development that is not related to the development of a specific system; the definitions are available at the website.  SSC San Diego will reject proposals that do not conform to instructions. The proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria, which are of equal importance: (1) potential contribution to the mission of the SURTASS and/or LCS programs to increase program responsiveness, efficiency and effectiveness; (2) overall scientific and technical merit, validity of approach, and probability of successfully demonstrating the proposed technology; (3) realism of the proposed cost and availability of funds; (4) potential for economical integration (positive return on investment) into existing and future Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) operations; and (5) interest by NAVSEA components in fielding successful concepts. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research for exclusive competition among these entities.  SSC San Diego provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs. Information and material submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  Questions of a contractual or technical nature should be directed to Ms. Sylvia Evans, SSC San Diego Code 225, via e-mail: sylvia.evans@navy.mil or telephone (619) 553-3292.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Biosystems and Cancer (LBC), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to procure on a sole source basis, data from respondents to the invitations for participation and data from respondents by actual participation in each assessment in the clinical follow-up of the 1993 and 1994 birth cohorts to the Stavanger Nested Case-Control Study of Preeclampsia with the Rogaland Central Hospital, PO Box 8100, NO-4068 Stavanger, Norway.  The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  Background: The Laboratory of Biosystems and Cancer, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, requires the collection of data on respondents from the first and second years of a prospective study of puberty in the 1993-4 birth cohort members and their parents to the study known as:  The influence of preeclampsia on hormonal and anthropometric status in boys and girls at 10 and 13 years of age:  Follow-up of the Stavanger population-based nested case-control study (heretofore referred to as the Puberty Follow-Up Study).  The Puberty Follow-Up Study has a high-risk population of mothers and children who participated in a birth study when the mothers suffered from preeclampsia during the index pregnancy in comparison with an age-matched set of normotensive controls (mothers and their offspring).  The ultimate purpose of this research project is to explore the biological mechanisms underlying why women who suffered from preeclampsia during pregnancy and their offspring are at significantly reduced risk of breast cancer (in mothers and daughters of that pregnancy) while the male offspring are at the lowest risk of prostate cancer identified in the literature.  The information collected during the first and second years of the study will enable the investigators at NCI, in collaboration with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and The Rogaland Hospital, Stavanger, Norway to assess in an ongoing fashion the follow-up of the cohort with the ultimate goal of identifying hormonal and other mechanisms associated with the lowered cancer risk in this population.  They have conducted the only population-based study of women diagnosed with preeclampsia in pregnancy and their offspring and a comparable set of normotensive controls.  The birth study utilized data from the birth registry in Norway and stored cord bloods to examine hormonal and anthropometric differences in the offspring of the preeclamptic and normotensive mothers.  The NCI has the opportunity to conduct a follow-up of these mothers and children, linking with the original study database.  The questionnaire items focus on dietary intake during the index pregnancy and since the birth of the index child, lifestyle and demographic characteristics, family history of cancer, and family history of reproductive disease, including preeclampsia in the mother’s and biological father’s families.   The clinical and anthropometric assessments will provide initial evaluation of the quality of data collection on and the pubertal developmental status of the offspring.  Period of Performance:  September 1, 2005 through November 30, 2005.  Rogaland Central Hospital is the only known source that can provide the aforementioned requirements.  The Rogaland Hospital has as its director, the original Principal Investigator to the Stavanger Nested Case-Control Study of Preeclampsia, who has had direct contact with all the families involved in the original study, thereby having credibility and links to the study population of interest.  The training in obstetrics and gynecology along with the experience of the Pediatric Department in adolescent medicine has given the team the knowledge and background to develop and conduct the study.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST on July 25, 2005.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Karen Gardner, Contract Specialist on gardnerka@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI5086, and is being issued as a Notice of Intent.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-04.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a small business concern.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334510, which has a business size standard of 500.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to procure a complete Cytogenetic System from Applied Spectral Imaging.  This system will add to the molecular cytogentic methods to characterize how particular chromosomal alterations contributing to the increase proliferation rate, loss of contact inhibition and cell malignant transformation.  The cytogenetics workstation incorporates a patented, interferometer based hyperspectral imaging platform for multi-color FISH, clinical banding, and quantitative FISH (ASI holds the patents for 24 color FISH).  Through its design, the system offers a single acquisition for multi-color FISH rather than multiple image captures using separate filters.  This eliminates the possibility of registration shifts and accommodates for uneven illumination and environmental factors which may harm the analysis.  This system never has to be retrained for lot by lot variations in probes which makes it even more unique.  This provides significant cost savings in probe usage and overall efficiency.  The system comes complete with a full featured database management system with full statistics, cell/case comparison, and reporting features.  No other system on the market is known to have this or the patented image acquisition technology.

<DESC>Project Schedule: The Forest Service expects to award the design and construction contract in the fall of 2005.   The Site will be immediately available to the contractor to commence site preparation and materials staging, while the weather cooperates.   Final design work, which includes the preparation of final construction drawings and specifications, and project work and safety plans, will be accomplished from October 2005 to May 2006.  Otherwise construction is not expected to begin until the site is accessible in late May or early June 2006.    The Forest Service expects that construction will be completed in the 2006 construction season and that there will be a minimum of 3 optional years of O&M to assure the site is stable and a vegetative cover established.
	
Project Location:  The Juniper mine is located at an elevation of 8,500 feet in the Stanislaus National Forest, Summit Ranger District, about 40 miles east of Sonora, California.  

Directions: HWY 108 east of Sonora to Forest Service road 5N01, approximately 35 miles, on the right, follow signs to Niagara OHV area.  Stay on 5N01 for approximately 12 miles to the turn off for Forest Service road 5N33, the entrance gate to the Site is a few hundred yards up 5N33, which is closed to the public.  The 5N33 turn off is between Sardine and Red Rock Meadows.  Haypress Meadow, and a cluster of summer cabins, is 1 -2 miles past the turn off.

Project Description:  The Juniper Uranium Mine Site (Site) is an abandoned open pit uranium mine.   After discovery of uranium in 1955, the mine produced an estimated 500 tons of ore from 1956 to 1966.  Ore processing was not performed on site.  The main site features, including the open pit and three overburden and waste rock piles, encompass approximately 34 acres.  The estimated combined volume of the waste rock and overburden piles is approximately 50,000 cubic yards.  The Forest Service plans to consolidate the waste piles and sediments from outwash areas around the site back into the open pit in an engineered Group A mine waste repository.  Because of a spring at the bottom of the pit and seeps emanating from the pit head wall, construction of an under drain (drain rock, perforated polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping, drainage fabric, and sand layer) to prevent groundwater from flowing into the repository will be required.  Contaminated material is to be consolidated into the repository in a prescribed order, covered with a 30-mil flexible geomembrane liner, a sand drainage layer and a minimum of 3 feet of clean soil from waste pile #3.  Disturbed areas and the final cover material will be graded, blended in with natural contours and revegetated to minimize surface erosion.  Because of the partially saturated condition of waste pile # 2, which is the most significant source of waste to be place in the repository, a water treatment system will be required. The repository is expected to generate drainage that will require treatment for a brief period of time after construction.  The Forest Service expects to use an on site passive ion exchange to treat drain down from the repository.  Design specifications for treatment will be developed based on analytical results of drainage after construction is completed.  This project will require 100% performance and payment bonds.

Brief Hazard Description:   (Hazards/Environmental Impacts):  Elevated levels of uranium and gamma radiation have been detected in the area of the open pit and waste rock pile #2.  Levels of gamma radiation were highest in waste rock pile #2 (125 to 11,500 micro Rem per hour) and the mine pit (30 to 6,500 micro Rem per hour).  Uranium was detected above the 1,064 mg/kg recreational Preliminary Remediation Goal (PRG) on the surface of waste rock pile #2.  Sediments containing radio nuclides, including Uranium and it’s decay products continue to migrate offsite from the pit and waste pile #2 with spring runoff, frequent summer thunderstorms and windborne dust.   Red rock creek and the area immediately around the site are utilized by the public, wildlife and grazing cattle.  Sensitive areas immediately down gradient from the site include Red Rock and Sardine meadows.  Pre bid tour scheduled date:July 15, 2005, 10:00AM to meet at Summit Ranger District,Stanislaus National Forest, Pinecrest CA.  Estimated Government Price Range is $100,000,000 and $500,000,000

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Nationwide Automatic Identification System (NAIS) Project Office (G-AIS). This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the USCG to acquire any products or services.  The USCG does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise pay for the information requested.  Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary.  The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other remuneration whatsoever.  In compliance with the Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) 2002, emerging maritime security requirements, and the need to improve vessel traffic services (VTS) and navigational safety, the USCG is developing an NAIS that will support Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) over the Nation’s navigable waters and adjacent sea areas.  MDA is the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime environment that could affect the security, safety, economy, or environment of the United States.  AIS is an international protocol which adheres to the International Telecommunications Union Sector for Radiocommunications (ITU-R) Recommendation M.1371-1 standard for ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore, and shore-to-ship communication of information, including vessel identity, position, speed, course, destination and other data of critical interest for navigation safety and maritime security.  AIS equipment is required domestically and internationally aboard many commercial vessels.  The information provided by NAIS will support most of the nation’s maritime interests, including the safety of vessels and waterways through collision avoidance and traffic management, safeguarding the nation through detection, identification, and classification of vessels from within national waters to thousands of miles offshore.  NAIS will complement other surveillance and intelligence systems that aid the essential process of identifying vessels requiring further investigation and action.  NAIS information will be displayed in command and control (C2) systems that receive USCG national maritime Common Operational Picture (COP) feeds, along with data and intelligence correlated as appropriate, with data from other Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and federal agency sources.  NAIS information will also be available to federal, state, and local port partners in support of security and safety operations.   NAIS will consist of an integrated system of AIS equipment (e.g., receivers, transmitters, antennas, etc.), data storage, processing, and networking infrastructure.  The intention of the NAIS Project is to use existing infrastructure and interoperate with other systems, federal agencies, and entities, as much as possible.  External systems will be included in the context of NAIS services, e.g., command and control (C2) systems, law enforcement databases, vessel traffic services (VTS), and notice of arrival databases, for the purpose of sharing infrastructure, quickly implementing capabilities, and improving performance.  NAIS has the capability of sending and receiving AIS messages, via a Very High Frequency (VHF) Data Link (VDL), to and from AIS equipped vessels, Aids to Navigation (ATON), and Search and Rescue (SAR) aircraft.  NAIS may leverage several types of platforms to support AIS receive and transmit infrastructure (e.g., towers) or receive-only infrastructure (e.g., aircraft).  AIS message data shall be transported over a wide area network (WAN) utilizing diverse, remote site connectivity (e.g., leased T-1 circuits, microwave, fiber optics).  NAIS shall process (e.g., validate, filter) and store AIS-provided vessel track and static data.  External systems shall be enhanced to provide data processing functions (e.g., vessel tracking correlation, intelligence processing, and anomaly detection), user interfaces, and indirect access for some NAIS users (e.g., USCG Deepwater assets, public and port partners).  All solutions shall be certified and accredited for compliance with all U.S. Federal, DHS, and USCG information assurance policies.  Preliminary high-level functional requirements are outlined as follows.  RECEIVE/TRANSMIT:  NAIS shall provide the capability to receive and transmit AIS messages via the VDL to and from all AIS equipped vessels within ports, navigable waters, and coastal areas out to 24 nm.  The system shall also be able to receive some AIS messages out to 2000 nm of the baseline from which U.S. territorial waters are measured.  Receive and transmit capabilities shall operate on all AIS channels as defined in ITU-R M.1371-1.  The AIS network shall consist of AIS reception and transmission sites; these sites may be completely separate or combined.  Monitoring and management of message traffic, frequency usage and interference throughout the area of required coverage shall be provided.  Methods of detecting and locating an interferer with AIS messaging and frequencies; and mitigating spoofing and jamming will be incorporated.   NETWORK:  The network shall route and transport data between AIS base stations, user interfaces, data processing capabilities, and external users.  A plan for Spectrum authorization/management shall be provided (See NTIA Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management). INTEROPERABILITY: NAIS shall leverage USCG enterprise architecture components to provide interoperability among USCG and external entities’ networks, databases, and systems.  Users may access AIS-related capabilities via external systems.  DATA PROCESSING:  NAIS shall store, retrieve, archive, and recover vessel data received, created, modified, and transmitted.  NAIS may leverage an existing data warehouse.  NAIS shall automatically verify and validate AIS data (e.g., position reports) through comparison with other AIS received information (e.g. time difference of arrival) and with other available independent sensors and data sources.  USER INTERFACES:  NAIS shall provide user interfaces (to the extent possible incorporated with or as modules of existing and planned command and control, analysis and information retrieval systems) for data analysis, system administration, and AIS message management.  The data analysis user interface shall include a means for users to query historical data via the archive.  Existing systems shall support vessel identification & tracking, vessel inspection & target selection, vessel traffic management, vessel movement analysis, maritime incident investigations, ATON and SAR.  ADMINISTRATION: NAIS shall provide network administration, system diagnostics, and physical status monitoring and alarm capabilities.  Each installation shall monitor its own performance and condition.  System monitoring capabilities shall not interfere with or degrade normal system functions.  NAIS may leverage existing administration capabilities and facilities (e.g., network operations center).  Software and network administration shall include the capability to monitor the health of the centralized software and network that is receiving and processing the data transmitted from remote sites/platforms as well as the capability to monitor system security in order to preserve the integrity of the AIS data received (current and historical). The USCG invites industry to respond with information regarding existing and planned capabilities for technical solutions, components, and implementation strategies similar to requirements being considered and described in this RFI.  The USCG is also interested in the technical feasibility and state of the market for achieving such requirements. The Government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI. Due to a variety of limitations, the USCG does not plan to entertain questions related to the substance of this RFI. Industry days, pre-solicitation, and/or pre-proposal conferences may be held, pending the level of interest. Industry is advised that Government support contractors will review non-proprietary information.  Responses to this RFI can be submitted no later than July 28, 2005 to Ms. Eleni Jernell (G-ACS-5D) via email at ejernell@comdt.uscg.mil or via mail at U.S. Coast Guard, 1900 Half Street SW, Washington, D.C., 20024, Attn: Ms. Eleni Jernell (G-ACS-5D).  Questions related solely to the transmittal of a response should be directed to Ms. Jernell at (202) 475-3298. Responses received after July 28, 2005 may not be reviewed. Responses should include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Maintenance on Proprietary SOFTBASE software

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate solely with SOFTBASE SYSTEMS INC, 1200 RIDGEFIELD BLVD, ASHEVILLE, NC 28806, under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) “Soliciting from a Single Source” to purchase upgrades to software already installed and in use at SSA Social Security Administration, 6401 Security Blvd, Baltimore, MD 21235, and corresponding upgrades to maintenance on that Government owned SOFTBASE software. The additional capacity shall be installed and placed on maintenance within FY2005 (i.e. before Oct 1, 2005).  The software licensing authority, and concurrent maintenance, is needed to support the projected growth in processing requirements.  SSA mainframes have been running near or at full capacity, and significant increases in volume of activity are anticipated in FY05.  Higher level mainframes have been/will be installed this year to deal with the upsurge in the workload.  A large portion of the boost in demand can be attributed directly to the additional workload resulting from the passage of the Medicare Modernization Act.  Increased capacity is crucial to the continuation of SSA?s mission. SSA must therefore purchase upgrades in order to continue legal usage of the software to be transferred to those mainframes, and will be doing so throughout fiscal year 2005 by way of modifying the existing contract/order as needed.  This is proprietary software and Softbase Systems, Inc. is the only known source capable of providing the required license upgrade and maintenance support.  Maintenance support provides the required software fixes, corrections and revisions necessary to ensure a stable processing environment.  Without maintenance support, the SSA software developers would experience degraded services, which would impact software development deadlines.  This software is a test and development support tool, used in the construction and maintenance of an application test environment.     SSA uses this software for the creation of realistic and representative test data essential to the integrity of SSA’s programs.  The software helps to streamline and simplify SSA’s application development environment, while satisfying applicable security and privacy requirements.  SOFTBASE has no authorized resellers.  The anticipated description, and quantity are as follows: Additional 117 MIPS for TESTBASE (formerly DGF-Data Generation Facility), and maintenance, for a total of 1079 MIPS.  SOFTBASE is the only authorized dealer known to the Government. The Government anticipates acquiring additional capacity through modifications to the existing purchase order.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, under the authority cited above.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit an offer.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all offers received within the response date of the publication will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) intends to negotiate with the University of Washington located in Seattle, Washington on a sole source basis to acquire the balance of genes potentially anticipated to be re-sequenced under current contract, N01-ES-15478.  The contract delineates “gene equivalents” which were intended to correlate approximately to the actual number of actual genes which would be re-sequenced.  Variance in the complexity of genes has resulted in the variance between the number of gene equivalents and number of genes themselves.   In addition, NIEHS will acquire web-based tutorials and training in support of the developed materials.  Depending upon the success of this undertaking, NIEHS may extend the training effort for an additional year.   Authority:  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306.302-1.  Inherent duplication of costs to the Government and unnecessary delays in completing the remaining genes render competition unfeasible.  See notes No. 22 and 26.

<DESC>The IPV contractor will employ a supplier/manufacturer network with the resources, finances & supply chain management capability to support planned & un-planned requirements.  The logistics solutions will integrate the various sources of supply, thereby achieving robust competition at the supplier level, while still providing seamless interface with DLA & its Air Force customers.  This sophisticated logistics solution requires a continuous open exchange of information between customer, supplier network & DLA.  A seamless logistics system with state-of-the-art information technology (IT) & assured communications is essential for optimum support & total asset visibility.  This program provides total supply chain management in support of consumables used in maintenance, repair & overhaul of Air Force weapon systems.  The contractor will employ a combination of commercial & government-DLA sources of supply in the performance of logistics support.  The contract will also include provisions in support of Worldwide Demand (WWD) requirements for selected items; Just-in-Time support; & at least a 99% fill rate for all schedule of item requirements.  This solicitation's customer base are three Air Logistic Centers (ALCs): Warner Robins, GA; Oklahoma City, OK; and Ogden, UT.  The contract scope includes approximately 52,000 National Stock Numbers (NSNs) with a total estimated annual value of  $75,000,000.00.  The Market Basket shall consist of commercially sourced items which represent the profile of commercially sourced items for the contract term, which are a subpopulation of the schedule of items.  Some items will be designated WWD & some will be designated site specific.  Unanticipated non-repetitive requirements will be supported by Spot-buys which are acqisitions based on customer urgency.  For each NSN on the Market Basket and the subsequent contract, offerors are required to provide a unit price & a total price for each NSN, a material management price and a grand total evaluated price (Note: All estimated prices are fully burdened to include Material cost, Profit & F.O.B. Destination).  It is the Government's intent to issue an Indefinite Quantity, Fixed-Priced with EPA contract.  The solicitation will contain a 3-year base period with two (2) 2-year options and one (1) 3-year option.  The solicitation will utilize 'Best Value Source Selection' procedures.  The government will consider other factors in addition to price when evaluating proposals to determine the best overall expected value.  Technical merit is considered significantly more important than price.  The evaluation factors will be Technical Merit; Past Performance; Socio-Economic Consideration; Javits-Wagner-O'Day considerations & DLA Mentoring Businesses Agreement Program.  Just-in-Time deliveries to Air Force sites (not the World Wide demand requirements) will be required.  Offerors will be required to submit a delivery schedule for the WWD quantities for each of the items listed in the Market Basket.  Note: Deliveries may vary among product lines; offerors are required to provide a delivery schedule for each.  The Trade Agreement Act applies to all items except those in FSG 95. The deadline for receipt of proposals will be forty-five (45) days from the solicitation issue date.  DSCP plans on conducting site visits approximately two or three weeks after the solicitation issue date.  The Schedule-of-Items and the Market Basket can be obtained, WHEN THE SOLICITATION IS ISSUED, by accessing the DSCP website at www.dscp.dla.mil./gi/general/ipvsites.html.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

It is anticipated that the  source selection process will continue through September 2005. Now that the  RFP is officially released, no contacts with or briefings to the Government on  this program by participating offerors are allowed outside the official source  selection process.

He is the only person  authorized to release information about this program. He may be reached at  (937)656-5033 or daniel.horine@wpafb.af.mil. Changes were made to Section 5.3.2 Chapters 2 + 3 in Section L and changes  were made to section 2.3.4.2 in Section M.   Section B:  Added CLIN 0007, Studies and Analyses, for future use.

Section L  Section 3.1.5.5 in Section L has been changed.  The following sentence has  been added: Corporate small business subcontractor plans may be an attachment  in Section 5 and referenced in Volume I.    UPDATE 16 May 05: Updated Sections L and M have been posted in the Bidders  Library at the end of this announcement.  Section L has an updated clause on  page 2 which is in blue ink.   Section M was updated in parts a and c in  Section 2.3.1.1.  UPDATE 12 May 05 (Second update for this date):  The 12 May TCP needed to be  changed.  The revised TCP is now posted in the Bidders Library at the end of  this announcement.  The changes are marked in red. UPDATE 12 May 05:  Three documents have been posted in the Bidders Library at  the end of this announcement.   The first is an updated CDRL Exhibit B. CDRL B001, Block 16, parts a, d and e have been updated.  The second is a  revised Technical Concept Paper(TCP).  An incorrect version of the TCP was  posted to PIXS on 6 May.

UPDATE 25 April 2005:  An updated draft Attachment 2 (Section L) and an  updated draft Attachment 3 (Section M) have been posted in the Bidders Library  at the end of this announcement.  Changes have been made in red ink for ease  in identification. UPDATE 07 April 2005:  An updated draft RFP has been posted in the Bidders  Library at the end of this announcment.  The purpose is to pass on the  incremental changes that have been incorporated in the document.   The biggest change in the draft is the increased emphasis on the early  delivery of a capability.  We have identified additional FY 05 funds and have  raised the first year of the funding profile from $1.5M to $2M.  There are  significant changes in the OCI clause.  It is recommended that you give the  RFP a careful review due to the number of small changes. The following attachments to the RFP have been updated as well:  CDRL Exhibit  A, CDRL Exhibit B, Attachment 1 (SOO), Attachment 2 (Section L), Attachment 3  (Section M), and Attachment 4 (TCP) and the DD 254. UPDATE 25 March 2005:  The Airborne Electronic Attack Squadron (AEASS) cannot  release the B-52 SOJ RFP until final approval of the acquisition strategy  and  the source selection plan.  We anticipate that may take another two weeks.  In  the interim, we plan to post an updated draft in the next few days to pass on  the incremental changes that have been incorporated in the document.   The biggest change in the draft is the increased emphasis on the early  delivery of a capability.  We have identified additional FY 05 funds and have  raised the first year of the funding profile from $1.5M to $2M.  There are  significant changes in the OCI clause.  It is recommended that you give the  RFP a careful review due to the number of small changes. As you are aware, we have been on a very aggressive schedule.  The delays we  are experiencing put our contract award schedule at risk.  We are requesting  your cooperation in helping us make up some schedule time by reducing the  number of days required for proposal preparation.  If you plan to bid this  program, request you provide the PCO feedback on the acceptability of reducing  the number of days for proposal submission from 45 days to a lesser number,  and identify the minimum time you believe is required.  Request your response  by 1 April 2005.  When a go-ahead is received from SAF/AQ and OSD, the AEASS  will determine the proposal due date and adjust the expected contract award  date accordingly.  UPDATE 22 March 2005:  A new attachment with the title of Questions and  Answers has been added to the document library below. UPDATE 21 March 2005:  Proposal due date information is changed as follows:   If the RFP is not released by 1 April 2005, there will be a day for day slip  in the proposal due date.   Also, information about the Past Performance volume due date is changed to  read as follows: Each offeror is requested to submit the Past Performance volume for relevant  Government contracts 28 days prior to the date established for receipt of  proposals.  Failure to submit early proposal information (Past Performance  volume) will not result in offeror disqualification.

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16 –  17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractor’s subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircraft’s strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV requires the purchase of an energizer black vibration exciter system.

Our existing vibration test systems have several limitations:  (1) none of them can be used to simulate shock vibration from percussive tools such as chipping hammers, road breakers, and riveters because they have limited capacity: (2) also because of their limited capacity we cannot apply a push force greater than 100 N on the shaker:  (3) our lab is small and the noise generated by the shaker could influence our subject experiments and test results, Hence, we need to upgrade the vibration test system.  The upgraded system must include a low noise 500 lb shaker, an updated vibration control system, and a quiet cooling package.  MB Dynamics has just developed a new, quiet 500 pound package shaker.  One of our two current vibration test systems was made by MB Dynamics and we will be trading in a MB Dynamics hand-arm vibration system single AXIS and control system.   The noise of the test system comes from two major sources:  (1) air cooling system (60dB) and (2) shaker vibration.  Unlike many other systems, this system will not need the air cooling for the majority of our experiments.  This can dramatically reduce the noise.

The noise level measured 20 inches from top of the shaker armature must be less then 80 dB when the system generates a broad band random vibration (power spectrum density = 3.0 (ms2)2 Hz from 10 to 1,000 Hz).  When working at 50 percent of its designed capacity, the operation of the test system shall not require any cooling so that the noise can be maintained at a minimum level.

It is the Government’s intent to issue a purchase order, on a sole-source basis in accordance with FAR 302-1(b)(1)(i), to MB Dynamics Inc., Bedford, Ohio

This is not a request for competitive quotes, and no solicitation is available.   Any interested parties may identify themselves to the contracting officer no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement.  Submit information to Rebecca Mullenax, MS-L1019, and Reference:  000HCC35-2005-23426, DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH/ALOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.   The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any sources exist, therefore, no solicitation will be issued.  If no responses are received within 15 days, award will be made to MB Dynamics.  Award will be made under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) without further notices being issued.  All responses received shall be considered by the Government.

<DESC>This is a supplemental sources sought notice for operation and maintenance of the Cobra Dane radar installation located in Shemya AK.  A previous notice was posted under reference number FA2521-04-CobraDane.  A solicitation has not been issued.  This notice is to solicit comments on the draft statement of work (SOW) also posted to this website, in relation to contract type, source selection procedures, and phase-in requirements.  Required services are to be procured on a firm fixed price basis with cost reimbursement line items for travel, supplies/materials and minor maintenance subcontracting.  A 30 day phase-in period will be included in the contract.  The price/performance tradeoff source selection technique is to be used for this procurement because only threshold performance requirements exist for this service.  Additional performance capabilities beyond the high standards required by the statement of work would not be of benefit to the government.  Relevance of past performance will be defined as broadly as possible.  All businesses that feel they would be interested in this solicitation should respond with comments on the draft SOW and this notice NLT the closing date of this announcement.  Responses should be sent by e-mail to james.loeffler@patrick.af.mil.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management intends to negotiate a contract, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with FORSightResources to embed the Growth & Yield Tree Simulator ORGANON within a Visual Basic (VB) program.  The objectives are to bootstrap the yield output for numerous plots containing tree-level data and apply the bias-corrected and accelerated (bca) method to the bootstrap results to produce sets of yields at user defined confidence intervals in addition to the traditional mean predicted values.  To accomplish this objective, the VB program must be able to pass the ORGANON parameters that are constant within a simulation via a drop-down menu or by filling in blanks that the user can control prior to the bootstrap execution.  The shell must also capture the yields and tree dimensions at each time interval. The yields at these intervals will be used to construct the proper confidence interval via the bca method and the tree lists produced can be adjusted by a factor for input into ORGANON for the next time interval computation. The applicable NAICS code is 541511.  No other vender is known to possess the level of expertise that fulfills the following contract requirements: "  Familiarity with forestry and specifically terms used in growth and yield modeling "  Familiarity with ORGANON "  Experience developing growth and yield curves "  Programming ability: Visual Basic preferred but other languages will be considered "  A conceptual understanding of bootstrapping. "  Have the ability to develop yield curves with data provided for managed and or natural stands. Vendors which can meet the above contract requirements should submit their qualifications in writing specifically addressing the six criteria described above to the Contracting Officer. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government will consider all responses received by 12:00 pm PST, Tuesday, July 26, 2005. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Scott Girouard Contracting Officer 3039695582     scott_girouard@nbc.gov;
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORATION The Department of the Interior (DOI) is seeking information on stable value 'wrap-only" investment management. Wrap-only investment management shall include wrapper contract negotiation and administration, wrapper credit analysis and monitoring, and liquidity management (including duration management). Wrap-only investment management specifically does not include fixed income portfolio investment management and fixed income portfolio manager selection. The investment portfolio, which shall be managed by an investment management firm not selected by the wrap manager, consists of U. S. Government and Government Sponsored Entity fixed income securities and has an approximate market value of $400 million. The fund is not a 401(k) plan, and will likely require providing additional information and data to wrap providers beyond a normal wrap procurement. QUESTIONS:  1.  Would you respond to an RPP to provide "wrap-only" investment management? 2. What do you believe is the range of annual fees (in basis points) which wrap managers would charge to procure and manage a stable value wrapper around a low duration portfolio of U.S. government fixed income securities? 3. What is the current value of stable value assets under your management.

<DESC>The US Air Force (USAF) Force Protection Battlelab (FPB) is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies related to developing a lighter, stronger form of armor.  The armor must be flexible, and be at an aerial density (14” x 14”) of six 6 pounds.  The armor must withstand multiple, sequential rounds of M2AP (2850 ft/sec. fired 15 feet at muzzle) striking the armor in a hexagonal pattern of six (6) rounds at equidistant points.  (At least two of the rounds will be fired at exactly 30 degrees oblique).  Hybrid technologies incorporating carbon nanotubes will comply with any relevant Occupational and Safety Health Administration (OSHA) standards for hazardous, aerolized particulates resulting from ballistic impact to the armor.  Through this BAA, the Air Force is requesting information concerning emerging technologies for force protection deployment.  Prospective vendors responding to this BAA will provide swatch samples of proposed armor (14” x 14”) for forensic ballistic testing at certified laboratories.

<DESC>Information Needed:
A.  Introduction: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  Federal Lands (FL) is seeking vendor sources that are capable of developing an enterprise-level Engineer Estimating, Bidding, Award and Construction over-site System (EEBACS) that will replace the current system performing this function.  The FL is comprised of three Division offices located in Sterling, Virginia, Denver, Colorado, and Vancouver, Washington.  There is also a headquarters office located in Washington, DC.  Each of the Division offices also has field offices located at various project sites.  Project sites may be located anywhere in United States or its territories.

The current system is comprised of two main parts, the Engineer’s Estimate System (EES) and the Progress Payment system (PPS).  The following describes these systems.

The EES system is a series of FoxPro programs that assists Highway Engineers in the development of cost estimates for highway construction projects.  It produces documents that are incorporated into a solicitation package for the construction of highway projects.  The program validates bid prices, identifies bidder ranking, and produces pertinent documents required for award of the contract.  After a highway contractor is selected pertinent data is sent to the PPS.  The EES consists of the programs listed below.

·	LASTEES.  This program is used by the designer to generate an estimate for the project.  The LASTEES provides the following functions:
1.	When the designer starts a project they enter a project description including project name, number, and location. 
2.	The designer selects the items that will be used on their project from the bid item table.  The designer enters item quantities for each of the bid items.
3.	At this point the designer can use the program to generate unit prices for each item.  To start the process the designer designates which data in the historical database will be used to generate the estimate.  The program allows the designer to make the following selections:
a.	Which States to include in the search or all. 
b.	The number of years of data to search in historical database.  The default is three years.
c.	Limits on the quantities to include or all.  The default is plus or minus 50% of the quantity specified for the project. d.	The number of bidders to include in the search.  The default is to include the three lowest bidders for each project.

Once the designer makes their selections, the program displays matching records from the historical database including project name, bidder number (1st, 2nd, 3rd lowest), quantity, and unit price.  The program displays a recommended unit price based on all of the data displayed.The designer can accept the recommended unit price or click on a single unit price or multiple unit prices to generate a new unit price.

The information used to generate the unit price can be saved and/or printed in order to maintain a record of how it was generated.  The unit price for that item is then included in the project estimate.  The process of generating the prices is called Unit Price Analysis.  The program provides the option for the designer to override the generated price based on their engineering judgment or for rounding purposes.

4.	Once a final bid is generated for the project, the program allows the user to distribute the cost and quantities across up to six account numbers.  The accounts can be split on an item-by-item basis and as a percent of each item.

5.	The program provides for one project schedule, multiple schedules, and base + options.

6.	The program provides the option to include construction engineering cost, and incentives for materials and other items as defined by FL.
7.	The program has several report options including:

a.	The Engineers estimate with incentives and other costs entered into the program.
b.	Unit price analysis.
c.	A bid schedule for use in contract documents (including supplemental user input text at either beginning or end of the generated document, ex.  NOTICE TO BIDDERS)
d.	A Summary of quantities that can be imported into Bentley MicroStation design files.

8.	The program allows the user to copy existing projects to start a new project.

9.	The program allows the user to copy one schedule to another for use on multiple schedule projects.

10.	Reports can be printed as hard copy or printed to Adobe Acrobat.

·	LASTUPDT.  This program is used to add, modify, and delete items in the master pay items database. 

·	BROWHIST.  This program is similar to the LASTEES program’s unit price analysis sub-program (bid history query).  This program is used to generate unit price analysis without having to create a project.

·	CONTRACT.  This program is utilized to analyze bids, update the bid history database, and generate the bidder information used in the PPS.

The analysis portion of the program provides the following functions:
1.	Ability for the user to enter bid information for each bidder into the database.
2.	Calculation of a bidders extended price based on the bidders unit price and item quantity.  For each item the user enters the unit price and the bidders extended price.  
3.	Comparison of the bidders extended price to the calculated extended price.  If the calculated extended price does not match the bidders extended unit price the item is flagged for review by the user.
a.	Comparison of the bidders total bid amount to the calculated total bid amount.  Discrepancies are flagged for review.
b.	Calculates the percent the total bid amount is above or below the engineers estimate.

4.	Ranking of the bidders based on the total bid amount.  

5.	Produce a report that shows each of the bid items and the unit price of each bidder listed in order of the total bid from lowest to highest (bid tabulations).  See the example report in Appendix.  This report is based on the calculated prices.

6.	Capability of A+B (Time + Dollar) or standard bidding procedures.

7.	Reports can be printed as hard copy or printed to Adobe Acrobat.
The program generates a zero estimate file that is used in the PPS program.
The program provides a utility to import the project bidder information into the bid history database after the zero estimate has been generated.   

The Contract program is used to produce contract documents and reports including:
1.	The bidder results as listed in the analysis section above. 
2.	Obligation Tabulation – indicates account splits and incentives using a selected bidders prices.
3.	Bid schedule/Contract schedule – using prices from a selected bidder.
4.	Zero estimate report
5.	Zero estimate file.

Samples of the reports are available upon request.

Progress Payment System (PPS) The program is a Windows based Microsoft Access database program that is used for tracking progress information on a roadway construction project (Inspector Daily Reports), submitting “progress estimate” reports back to the division offices to process for payments for the contract, and generating the “summary book” (a detailed description of how the project was constructed, including materials, equipment, and personnel).  This program is sometimes referred to as the Progress Estimate program.   The PPS program provides the following functions:

1.	The Start Form functions as the “main menu” for the program.  This allows the user to pick the particular function of the program that is to be executed.

2.	The Project Form is a four-page form for viewing, entering and editing project information.  Each page is accessed by a tab at the top of the form.  Tabs access project information, current estimate, accounts, and highway contractor information.

3.	The Item/Quantity Form is a form used to view, enter, and edit pay item records along with that item’s quantity records into the Progress Estimate database.

4.	The Daily Form is a form used to view, add, delete, or edit daily production records into the Progress Estimate database.

5.	Reports dialog.  Produces a number of reports.  The Progress Estimate report has two versions, one for FHWA use that has “probable” quantity amounts and one for highway contractors that does not include the “probable” quantities.  There is a Supporting Data report that produces data that supports the current progress estimate.  Reports can be made for the current estimate being produced or for previously submitted estimates.  Lastly, there are summary type reports like the Summary Book and the Production Summary Sheet that track all of the pay items for date completed, days used, work completed, work remaining, running totals, and percent complete.
Samples of the reports are available upon request.

<SUBJECT>39 -- Remote Sensing and Sealing Technology
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is currently pursuing the development of the next-generation fiber optic loop seal, the Secure Sensor Platform (SSP).  The new device is based upon the previously designed multi-mission electronic sensor and communication platform.  This platform launched the development of the T-1A, which is currently in production at Honeywell FM&T for the Savannah River Site.  The T-1A is configured as an active-fiber optic seal with authenticated, bi-directional RF communications, capable of supporting external sensors.  The design of the SSP enhances virtually all of the existing capabilities of the T-1A and adds many new features and capabilities, such as support for standard encryption and authentication; solid-state, 3-axis motion detection; and a new message-rich communication protocol with greater noise immunity.  Additionally, the SSP will provide such capabilities as intrinsic code verification, active collision avoidance, and simple, secure remote internet access to SSP message data.  The SSP is designed for low-cost production by utilizing automated assembly processes and minimizing manual processes.  The versatility of this new device allows the capabilities to be selected and tailored to best fit the specific application.
Partnerships are anticipated to take the form of Cooperative Research & Development Agreements (CRADA) and/or commercial licenses.  CRADAs are anticipated to include funds-in to the Labs and rights licensed may be up to exclusive in a designated field-of-use, depending upon business case.  Sandia is seeking partners with proven experience in translating technologies into market-driven products, have technical capabilities in the technical subject matter described within, are fiscally sound and well managed, and can commit to product manufacture in the U.S. Patents have been awarded for T-1A and additional patents are pending for this technology.

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is seeking partners who may be interested in teaming for the operation of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC), a facility to be constructed by the DHS at the US Army Fort Detrick, MD site.     The US Army has released a draft RFP for comment, for the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center operating contract, reference Federal Business Opportunity Special Notice USA-SNOTE-050531-006, released May 31, 2005, or http://www-usamraa.army.mil/pages/index.cfm.     

Sandia is one of the nation?s largest research and development facilities.     A Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratory, Sandia?s programs support DOE and the U.S. national security needs of many other federal agencies?including the departments of Homeland Security, Defense, Justice, Transportation, EPA, and others. The organization?s technical programs range from basic scientific research to manufacturing operations with a particular emphasis on the development and deployment of robust, engineered systems solutions to problems of core national interest.     

Sandia is a major participant in DHS science and technology programs addressing biological national security issues.     Of direct importance to NBACC objectives is Sandia?s technical expertise (and supporting facilities) in biological science, analytical and bioanalytical chemistry, aerosol science and technology, advanced bioanalytical systems development and application, and systems analysis. Supporting capabilities in microsystems research and development, high-performance computing, biological countermeasures systems development, biodefense systems engineering, and work in international monitoring programs are also relevant to the NBACC mission.

For more than a decade, Sandia has been heavily involved in the analysis of biodefense options and in the development and deployment of biological countermeasures technologies and systems. The work at Sandia touches on all aspects of this issue from detection of proliferant activities to the deployment of warning and response systems in urban settings to the decontamination and restoration to operation of contaminated facilities. Scientific efforts range from fundamental research into the mechanisms of virulence to bioforensic casework arising from the anthrax releases of the Fall of 2001. The work is principally focused on the threat of use of such agents against civilian populations and venues, but efforts to address the problem of protecting military forces and installations are also a significant part of our activity.

Sandia is interested in providing the technical capabilities described above in partnership with one or more parties having an interest in providing the operational and management expertise in response to the NBACC RFP.     Sandia is specifically interested in teaming with an entity or entities with significant capabilities or experience in managing facilities similar to the NBACC, management of FFRDCS, management of classified facilities, management of biological laboratories and biocontainment facilities, experience working with DHS and DoD, and capabilities to provide the infrastructure to manage NBACC operational requirements.     Sandia is especially interested in a teaming arrangement in which Sandia would play a leadership role in managing and conducting the scientific and technical programs including the development and transition to products of technologies to achieve the objectives of the NBACC.

Interested parties should contact Teresa Montoya, FBO Administration by phone (505) 844-7522 or email at tmontoy@sandia.gov, no later than July 22, 2005.     Responders are asked to provide:     1) A current annual business/financial report, 2) a description of the responder's desired role, and Sandia?s expected role, in a management team for the operation of NBACC, and 3) a description of the responder's capabilities and expertise related to:
a)       management of FFRDCS
b)       management of classified facilities
c)       management of biological laboratories/biocontainment facilities at or above the BSL2 level
d)       experience working with DHS and DoD
e)       excellence in business operations, i.e., financial operations, reporting, QA/QC, human resources, procurement and property management, safety and environmental responsibility, and legal functions, etc.

Sandia National Laboratories is a government-owned-contractor-operated facility operated by Sandia Corporation, a subsidiary of the Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) under Management and Operating (M&O) Contract DE-ACO4-94AL85000. As an FFRDC, Sandia is bound by Federal Acquisition Regulations and .DOE requirements.     Sandia's capabilities are available to parties interested in responding to the DHS NBACC RFP, subject to complementary interests with Sandia. 

Sandia reserves the right to decline to submit a proposal in response to the final RFP for the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center.

<SUBJECT>D -- INTERNET PROVIDER SERVICES
<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS SPECIAL NOTICE IS TO PROVIDE A RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY THE CONTRACTORS IN REGARD TO SOLICITATION, REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) NO. HE1260-05-R-0022 (INTERNET PROVIDER SERVICES).  THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ARE PROVIDED:


Question:

Can you clarify your request for 100M + 10M IP speed?  Are you asking for two separate IP ports or one single IP port?

Answer:

All locations in Okinawa are inter-connected via a layer two network at 100Mbps and share a 10Mbps connection to the Internet.

Question:

Can you clarify your request for 1.5M x 2 speed?  Are you asking for 2 separate 1.5M IP ports or one single 3M IP port?

Answer:

1.5M x 2 = a requirement for 3 Mbps.  It is up to the contractor to determine how they provide this.

Question:

Am I correct in assuming that we need to price out all speeds in TE-1, as well as the primary pricing schedule on pages 5-14?

Answer:

You are required to price out all the speeds listed in Section II, Schedule - Section B, as amended by Amendment No. 0001.

Question:

Can you please confirm your service delivery date(s)?
 
Answer:

We require service to commence on October 1, 2005.

Question:

Am I correct that you have no address information other than what has been provided in the RFP?  Some of our subcontractors are asking for address information.

Answer:

We cannot provide any more explicit address information than was included in the RPP because, to our knowledge, it does not exist.

Question:

Can DoDDS-P give Sprint a word document for all pricing sheets to be priced, the contractual information, i.e. Reps and Certs, and Past Performance Survey, so Sprint and our past performance references can fill this information in?  We currently can not do this with the Adobe format.

Answer:

The information has been provided to the contractor on the week of 4 July 2005.

Question:

Sprint is formally asking for at least a two week extension to the due date based on the required time to formulate a complete solution with valid and accurate pricing.  Can an extension be granted?

Answer:

Based on Amendment No. 0001, the solicitation was extended from 21 July 2005 to 28 July 2005.  At this time, this is the only extension that will be provided.

Question:

How many static IP addresses do you require at each site?  Sprint realizes that DoDDS-P is requesting a full class C range, but is such a large range needed for a DoD school.  Can we have clarification on this?

Answer:
 
DoDDS-P requires a full class C network for each Service Delivery Point.

Question:

Could you provide the building number and room number for the service delivery point at each base/site in Japan/Okinawa?

Sprint needs to confirm that there is already fiber installed into each site.  Can you confirm this? 

If the site does not have fiber installed, could you confirm whether there is on-base fiber currently available for use from the standard carrier demarc point to the SDP?

Answer:
 
It is up to the prospective contractor to determine the availability and termination point of local loop fiber for each base.

Question:

What CISCO models and IOS version do you intend to use at each site? 

Answer:

DoDDS-P provided a list of interface part numbers in a Technical Exhibit.

Question:

Will you use BGP?

Answer:
 
The Performance Work Statement specifically states that DoDDS-P does not intend to participate in or exchange dynamic routing information with the contractor.

Question:

Technical Exhibits 1 and 2 both list each location but no physical addresses. Looked at the web sites for each school and district office, which all have military post address listed.  But we need to get the physical addresses of the termination points i.e. where we connect to the campus network router.  Do you have a list of the point of presence addresses we can use? 

Answer:

The installation locations are listed in the Service Delivery Point exhibit by city, and prefecture in the case of Mainland Japan.  There are no physical addresses.

Question:

Can you share with us the list of PSTN’s or local carriers that have agreements with each location?  For example here in Guam GTA is the local carrier that has the interconnection agreement to Andersen AFB.  These being the carriers we need to contact to arrange local loops to your facilities. 
Answer:

We cannot provide a list of local carriers that have agreements with the installations.

Question:  

Interested in the expected award date, award notification and the date the provider will be empowered to proceed.  Depending on each local carrier requirements for engineering and installing the local loops, this process can take 45 to 60 days.  From the attached schedule the go live date is October 1, realistic expectations of ordering local loops would be the first week of August, 2005.  Smart transition planning requires parallel circuits with a pre-testing period before cut over to the new service.  This is in regards to our planning and developing our quote and expedite costs will increase the NRC. 

Answer:

We need this service to start on October 1, 2005.

Question:  

This question is two parts concerning Performance Requirements. 
QASP 3, Access Service Latency – 95% of the time natural round trip latency of a given access speed.  To what destination round trip will be polled, open Internet to US destination, regional Internet or between the schools?  More detail of your concerns and expectations would be helpful. 
QASP 4, Transport Service Latency – 90% of the time no more than 100ms roundtrip latency between any two contractor Points of Presence within each geographic area.  Can you share with us more detail on the geographic area sizes?  We monitor our dedicated network closely to ensure traffic flows at subscribed data rates, but public Internet connectivity can be erratic.  So if you can describe your functional needs, i.e. VPN, Video Conferencing or… and the associated geographical areas, we can then engineer a network design that will better suit your needs.

Answer:  

a.)  Access Service is the portion of the service between the Service Delivery Point (SDP) and the contractor’s next hop router (first upstream).

b.)  Transport Service Latency is a measure of the time it takes a packet to travel between any two of the contractor’s next hop routers supporting any of the SDP’s.  We consider Guam, Okinawa, Mainland Japan, and South Korea to be the boundaries of the four geographic areas. If the Geographic size of the areas is relevant to the contractor, we believe the list of installation locations provided in the Service Delivery Point exhibit is enough information for them to deduce it from.


Question:	

I would like to request an extension of two weeks for the due date for this RFP.  Sprint needs site addresses and phone exchanges to ensure that each site is properly priced.   Can you please advise me of when I can get this information?  

Answer: 

There are no street addresses.  The locations are US Military bases.  This was clearly stated in the PWS.  The installation locations were listed by city in Technical Exhibit 1.  I have included a list of commercial telephone number prefixes associated with each of the installations, information that is readily available on the internet.

<SUBJECT>J -- Maintenance and Repair of Equipment
<DESC>Subject to final approval, The Department of Treasury’s Bureau of the Public debt (BPD), on behalf of the Armed Forces Retirement Home intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with Johnson Controls Inc. for the acquisition of maintenance and repair services.  The Government intends to award a contract for one-year with two one-year option periods.

Nature and Description of Action:
The Armed Forces Retirement Home located in Washington, DC has a requirement for maintenance and repair of their pneumatic and electronic control systems for heating, cooling and ventilation. The contractor shall supply all material and labor to perform a comprehensive inspection and calibration of the pneumatic controls in the LaGarde Building and the Bowling Alley (Sheridan Building) at the Armed Forces Retirement Home-Washington, DC.   Testing shall include all pneumatic controls, transmitters, and other related pneumatics that control heating, cooling, and ventilation, including but not limited to valves, dampers, temperature, pressure/electric (PE), electric/pressure (EP), and air handler units.

A sole source to Johnson Controls Inc is intended for this task.  The systems located within LaGarde and Sheridan Bowling alley areas are Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) proprietary systems.  As such, they are the only authorized entity who can repair/replace items within the systems.  The installed equipment infrastructure that provides heating and cooling is electronically operated by a series of PLC’s (Programmable Logic Controllers).  The HVAC system cannot be operated without the PLC’s because they control the functions of the equipment through a customized software program that is owned by Johnson Controls Inc.  The Armed Forces Retirement Home pays a licensing fee for the use of this software.  The fee is part of the cost of the monthly maintenance agreement.  Since the software is a custom-designed application, there is no alternative available from other sources on the commercial market. 
 No solicitation document is available.  The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 10 days after publication of this notice.    Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirement or functional equivalent, at terms more advantageous to the Government.  A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response.     If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, a sole-source award will be negotiated with Johnson Controls Inc.

Interested parties are requested to submit responses electronically to Alan Dotson at ntprocurement@bpd.treas.gov or, responses may be addressed to Alan Dotson, Bureau of the Public Debt, Division of Procurement, 200 Third Street UNB 4th Floor, Parkersburg, WV  26101.  E-mail responses requiring more than 5 megabytes of memory must be sent as separate files.
  
Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list. Therefore, we recommend that you monitor the FedBizOpps site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)- The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Contractor shall submit a proposal, which shall include: 1)Technical-A) Provide a detailed data package demonstrating that the replacement battery is a form, fit and functional replacement for SAFT P/N 23176. B) Provide battery charger technical information, size and weight. C) Provide evidence of and the ability to maintain a quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard. D) Provide FAA certification for the battery cells. 2) Warranty: Provide warranty information and details. 3) Past performance-A) Provide past performance and reliability information. B) Provide points of contact for past performance documentation for the past two years.  Include references’ name, company, phone number and e-mail address.  The Coast Guard will utilize any source deemed relevant for past performance information, including USCG personnel with knowledge of Vendor's past performance and Government Past Performance Information retrieval system. 4) Price Quotation- A) Provide a Firm Fixed Price for 56 ea. batteries, 34 ea. portable chargers and 1 ea. Electronic Maintenance Manual. B) The prospective contractor’s price quotation will be evaluated based on competition and market research.  The U.S. Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose quote is identified as offering the best value solution.  The Coast Guard may determine the best value for the Coast Guard merits a higher price based on technical and warranty superiority.  The USCG, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the quotations relative capability as measured against the following evaluation factors: Factor 1 –Technical, Factor 2 – Warranty, Factor 3 – Past Performance and Factor 4 – Price. Factor 1 and Factor 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3.  While Factor 4-Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-price factors are significantly more important than the price factor. Price will become increasingly important as quotation evaluation ratings for technical factors approach equal. ENCLOSURE(1) DETAILED FACTORS: Factor 1:  Technical Approach- The technical solution/approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Contractor’s solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives for SAFT battery P/N 23176 replacement.  The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the Contractor has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused.  Evidence of the quality of the technical approach includes: 1) a sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates that the replacement battery is a form fit and function replacement with the exception of the dummy thermal connector.  That battery charger meets the Coast Guards five (5) pound weight for use on or off of the aircraft. 2) The Contractor’s validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance E.g., ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications. Factor 2: Warranty-a complete description of warranty terms and conditions.  Factor 3:  Past Performance- The past performance evaluation will examine how the Contractors past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction.  The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the quotation. Factor 4:  Price-Each Contractor’s price quotation will be evaluated based on the following: 1) Evaluation or quoted price for 56 batteries and 34 chargers. 2) The prospective contractor’s quotation will be evaluated based on competition and market research.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

7.  Solution Software Descriptions

The TSA IOSAC utilizes various software applications to provide a geospatially-enabled situational awareness capability across multiple platforms.  These applications provide web based services, temporal data services and capabilities for geospatial visualization and analysis and database management.  

8.  Database Management System Software

The Oracle Software Suite provides the primary repository of geospatial data for the TSA IOSAC Area of Operations centered around MIA.  The Oracle 10g Database provides a platform that supports the management of geographic data, including Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant data, by providing access control, backup and recovery, and spatial/non-spatial indexing to improve performance.  It provides a robust foundation for complex GIS applications that require more spatial analysis and processing within the Oracle Database.  

9.  Geospatial Visualization Software

Geospatial software organizes information by its location, a common component of most databases.  By viewing information in the form of an electronic map, users have a better way to organize, share and visualize data for improved communications and enhanced decision making.  

Environment Systems Research Institute’s (ESRI) ArcGIS application suite provides a scalable GIS capability for geographic data creation, integration and analysis.  ArcGIS is utilized primarily by the GIS Analyst at the Strategic and Tactical Operations Centers for data manipulation and analysis.  ESRI’s ArcPad software is the primary GIS visualization tool fro mobile users equipped with a PDA device.  ArcPad is a lightweight, mobile mapping solution that can retrieve maps using wireless technology.  

Skyline Software System’s applications are used to provide 3D visualization and editing capabilities.  Skyline’s TerraGate software application employs powerful network data server technology designed to stream 3D geographic data in real time.  TerraExplorer Pro is a tool for editing, annotating and publishing photo-realistic interactive 3D environments.  Skyline is the primary 3D visualization tool for the user equipped with a PC workstation, laptop or tablet PC.  

10.  Web-Based Services Software

Web services for the TSA IOSAC are enabled with Windows Internet Information Server (IIS) web server in conjunction with the Apache Tomcat servlet engine.  Together the web server and servlet engine provide the basic client/server connectivity to dynamic situational awareness data such as coordinated response tracking.  The Tracking Server software developed by NG-TASC provides the capability to collect data feeds and transmit real-time event-based information to web clients and custom applications.  Web clients provide users with a view of the real-time data to assist in the monitoring of events or assets.  The delivery of data to desktop custom applications satisfies the needs of users who require the capability to perform detailed real-time and historical data analysis while integrating with existing GIS analysis functionality.

DESCRIPTION:

Commonly known as elkhorn coral, Acropora palmate is an important shallow water reef framework builder in the Florida Reef Tract and is especially important given the longevity and limited recruitment of this species.  The severe population declines of Acroproa palmate due to disease and bleaching 20 years ago have changed the composition, structure, and function of the Florida Keys coral reef ecosystem.  It is known that corals harbor a diverse set of microbial symbionts associated with surface mucus layer and these microbial symbionts are likely to play an important role in the health and resiliency of corals.  This study will establish important microbial flora data relative to Acropora palmate resiliency, and spatial distribution in the FKNMS.  The use of Acropora palmate as a keystone species for the FKNMS can translate to other species, which also host microbial communities, throughout the system of National Marine Sanctuaries.


REQUIREMENTS:

The FKNMS is seeking a contractor to perform the following tasks.

Task 1 - 	Field/Marine sampling of elkhorn coral surface mucus using needless syringe at varying locations throughout the Florida reef tract, including upper, middle, and lower Keys.  The location for sampling will be determined onsite based on coral health.  The number of corals sampled within each region will be between 20 and 40.

Task 2 - 	Field/Marine sampling of seawater adjacent to the specimen elkhorn coral colony, for microbial composition.

Task 3 - 	Generate cultures and analyze data from samples.

Task 4 – 	Identify bacteria and perform dereplication of marine culturables.

Task 5 - 	Produce a reports on the findings of the above listed tasks.  Reports will be due every 6 and 12 months for the life of the contract.

Task 6 - 	Travel associated with marine sampling.


Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:

Contractor must provide all equipment, facilities, and staff necessary to perform the tasks described herein.  There are no benefits and the contractor is responsible for payroll taxes and insurance including medical.  The contractor shall not be deemed a Federal employee for any purposes including Federal Tort Claims Act and Federal Employee Compensation Act purposes.

Payments will be made via electronic funds transfer (EFT).  

NOTE:  THE ABOVE ARE MIMUMUM REQUIREMENTS.

DESCRIPTION:

Typically the FKNMS has 600 +/- reported vessel groundings each year.  Many of the grounding sites are candidates for restoration and when possible the natural coral structures are stabilized shortly after impact.  There often is a need for new coral colonies to restore a site following grounding to help replace live coral that could not be stabilized.  Recently, restoration projects have taken a new approach by utilizing corals grown (from fragments) in aquaculture facilities.

Growing corals in an aquaculture facility begins with small coral fragments taken from grounding sites or other disturbed areas, placing them in a controlled recirculating aquarium, monitoring growth patterns, and when at an appropriate size, reattaching the coral on the seafloor at a predetermined restoration site.  There are various species of coral that are available for aquaculture.  Coral is a protected species and the work must be performed with the appropriate permits for coral possession and aquaculture.


REQUIREMENTS:

Task 1 – Work with FKNMS staff to assess and acquire coral fragments for placement in aquaculture facility after a grounding incident.

Task 2 – Once corals are placed in aquaculture facility, ensure coral growth and mortality within acceptable limits.  Acceptable mortality limits will be determined in consultation with FKNMS staff on a case by case basis.

Task 3 – Provide staff, equipment, facilities, and permits to perform the above mentioned tasks.

Task 4 – Report findings in a written and electronic format on a semi annual basis.  Report should include details on the corals, e.g. species, size, number of fragments, acquisition date, location of grounding, and other information relating to methodology of the aquaculture facility.  The reports will be provided to the FKNMS Science Coordinator.

Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:

Contractor must provide staff, equipment, and facilities for the above mentioned tasks.
Contractor must provide information on coral knowledge and prior, relevant research.
Contractor must obtain FKNMS permit for coral possession.
Contractor must provide valid / current State of Florida aquaculture permit.

NOAA/FKNMS staff will provide contract related training when necessary.  The contractor will provide all staff, equipment, and supplies necessary to perform the tasks described above.  There are no benefits and the contractor is responsible for payroll taxes and insurance including medical.  The contractor shall not be deemed a Federal employee for any purposes including Federal Tort Claims Act and Federal Employee Compensation Act purposes.

Payments will be made via electronic funds transfer (EFT).

DESCRIPTION:

A goal of managers in the FKNMS is to use aquaculture facilities to stabilize the health of corals rescued or salvaged from vessel groundings or construction sites.  The eventual objective is to return some of these corals to their natural environment, while making some of the colonies available to scientists, public aquaria, and other educational and scientific purposes.  The exchange or trade of protected species, such as corals, requires being able to determine the original source.

In order to have a coral aquaculture program where protected species can be exchanged between scientists, public aquaria and others, and established mechanism for tracking a particular coral back to its parent colony is needed.  This is particularly important in helping prevent the establishment of a coral black market.  Corals that are propagated in aquaculture facilities from parent colonies that were collected under legal permits need to be tracked back to those parent colonies in order to prevent illegal trade of corals.  DNA tracking has been used in marine mammals and other protected species but has not previously been attempted for tracking corals.  If successful, this project will aid managers and other authorities in the management and control of the highly regulated corals used by aquaculture facilities.

REQUIREMENTS:

The FKNMS has a need to determine the feasibility of coral genetic fingerprinting as a mechanism to track native and cultured coral.

Task 1 – Determine the best method of DNA identification using various molecular techniques on one coral species.  A gene specific identification of individuals, amplified fragment length polymorphisms, or other method may be used.

Task 2 – Produce a detailed report on each method with a recommendation for the preferred method for this purpose.  Reports on each method will be due at 6 and 12 months for the life of the contract.

Task 3 – Provide a final report to FKNMS in digital and hardcopy formats.  Report due annually at the end of each contract year.

In addition to the above tasks if applicable, the option years will have the following tasks:

Task 1a – Using the best method as recommended in Task 1 or as recommended by FKNMS, determine DNA sequencing for other coral species.

Task 2a – Produce a detailed report for each species.

Task 3a – Provide a final, summary report to FKNMS in digital and hardcopy formats.  Report due annually at the end of each contract year.


Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:

Contractor must provide staff, equipment, and facilities for the above mentioned tasks.

NOAA/FKNMS staff will provide contract related training when necessary.  The contractor will provide all staff, equipment, and supplies necessary to perform the tasks described above.  There are no benefits and the contractor is responsible for payroll taxes and insurance including medical.  The contractor shall not be deemed a Federal employee for any purposes including Federal Tort Claims Act and Federal Employee Compensation Act purposes.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

Background:
The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military (HAA/Military) position was established to more effectively coordinate the activities of the Military Liaison Unit (MLU) of the Operations Division (OPS) of USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).  These activities include military liaison and coordination, Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) deployment, Response Management Team (RMT) participation and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, or Explosive (CBRNE) disaster planning under Presidential Decision Directive 39/62.  The HAA/Military will serve within the OPS Division’s MLU and will function as the Division’s principal point of contact with the Department of Defense (DOD).

Introduction:
OFDA is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).  OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations.  DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices. The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs), to ensure OFDA’s capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.

The Operations Division (OPS) consists of three teams; the Operations Support Team (OST), the Overseas Administration Team (OAT), and the Field Support Team (FST).

The OST provides technical guidance and expertise in Disaster Logistics, Search and Rescue (SAR), Operations Center Management, Military Liaison, Consequence Management, overseas support to OFDA offices and personnel and other sectors necessary to assure OFDA's capacity to execute and coordinate USG humanitarian assistance and response to natural disasters and complex emergencies.

The OAT provides administrative services to OFDA’s field offices.  The OAT also manages the Response Alternatives for Technical Services (RATS) program, which provides rapid, surge capacity staffing.

The FST coordinates surge capacity staffing mechanisms, manages an inter-agency agreement with the US Forest Service for surge capacity staffing and OFDA response system design, maintains and trains on disaster response systems such as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) and the Response Management Team (RMT), coordinates with other agencies in the USG and with some elements of the UN, and coordinates the Public Donations Information and Outreach project.

OBJECTIVE:
The Humanitarian Assistance Advisor/Military will provide the critical liaison function between USAID and the DoD military establishment in order to represent the humanitarian sector perspective and expertise in situations where coordination between the parties is required.

STATEMENT OF WORK:
The OFDA Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational and technical support for disaster responses.  The OPS Division identifies sources for procurement of relief supplies and manages the stockpiling and transportation of those supplies.  The Division maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams and the Office’s capability for deploying Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and Response Management Teams (RMTs) in Washington.  The Division develops and maintains OFDA’s relationships with DOD, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Energy (DOE).

The HAA/Military will be assigned to the OPS MLU in Washington, D.C. for an initial period of 2 years.  Travel is required to attend DOD conferences, exercises and other related activities on behalf of USAID, OFDA, a particular DART or RMT and/or a CBRNE planning exercise as directed by the OFDA/OPS Division Chief through the MLU Leader.  The incumbent may be deployed with an American military unit for up to two years.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
The incumbent’s duties and responsibilities will include, but will not be limited to, the following:
• Coordination with the humanitarian community to achieve the best use of military assets by reducing redundant or counterproductive military activities;
• Assisting the military in defining and reconciling its role with that of the greater humanitarian relief community;
• Seeking out methods to most effectively utilize DOD strengths;
• Representing OFDA in appropriate DOD training and planning exercises with subsequent reporting to OFDA divisions on activities, lessons learned, success and future activities as a result of OFDA participation;
• Representing OFDA in DOD conferences in the context of priorities set forth by the OPS Division Chief.  To strike a balance with lower level exercises and their operational impact, the incumbent will also place emphasis on participation in After-action Reviews (AARs), humanitarian exercises sponsored at the Combatant Command level and at operational level and strategic planning exercises normally conducted through Pentagon auspices to interact with policy makers;
• Supporting OFDA management in defining a strategy for military coordination which will include guidelines for determining OFDA participation in DOD operations when specific requests are made and where OFDA should request activities and participation;
• Determining whether OFDA participation in DOD humanitarian activities is necessary and useful;
• Providing OFDA briefings and training to uniform military officers at various DOD educational institutions (War Colleges, National Defense University, Navy Postgraduate School, etc.);
• Coordinating with DOD and the Department of State’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs to provide OFDA staff with briefings on military procedures, assets, roles, capabilities, culture, chain-of-command and humanitarian-related activities and circulate status reports which summarize DOD activities in which OFDA personnel are involved;
• Deploying with DOD forces in humanitarian emergencies;
• Providing reports, debriefs and evaluations to the OPS Division Chief and other appropriate OFDA staff of all planning, exercises and deployments;
• Assisting in the identification of OFDA’s Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division deployment needs in designated "at risk" countries where DARTs may deploy and work with other teams within OFDA to determine appropriate DART needs as a basis for contingency planning for personnel and resources;
• Availability for deployment to the field as a DART member;
• Assisting the MLU in providing classified U.S. Government (USG) information support to OFDA as requested and to selected DARTs and RMTs on an as-needed basis;
• Assisting regional Combatant Commanders (COCOMs)  in developing the humanitarian assistance aspect of their strategic operations and crisis action planning products; and
• Liaison with the DOD and other elements of the USG in an effort to help the military coordinate with the humanitarian community.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The incumbent will take direction from and report to the OPS MLU Leader in Washington, DC.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently and perform with minimal direction in responding to humanitarian emergencies and military liaison activities as part of a high-tempo office environment.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; firm-fixed-price proposals for overhaul of the following items are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-05-Q-30018 is being  assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only and this synopsis/solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

<DESC>There are two purposes for this amendment.     

The first purpose is to answer questions posed by vendors.  The questions and answers are below.  Due to the need to make award in a timely fashion, no more questions can be answered.  Accordingly, quotations should be made based on the original solicitation and this amendment.   

The second purpose is to extend the quotation due date from 5:00 P.M. (EST) on July 12, 2005, to 5:00 P.M. (EST) on July 13, 2005. 

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q:  Regarding Line items 1-4, can you give me an idea on quantity you might be needing to print? 

A:  For line items 1 – 4, we are seeking a per print cost, per size, described in the line items.  Most items are single print items, not a mass of one (1) jpeg (e.g., 50 copies of one shot).  There may be an occasional “head count” for group shots.  The quantity will vary.   

Q:  Will the montage get printed as well or will we be supplying back a digital file for you?  

A:  The montage will get printed.  

Q:  The award is only for a two month period.  How is the one year option period awarded?  

A:  It will be awarded pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  

Q:  What are the projected quantities for the 2 month period and the 1 year period? 

A:  The quantities will vary for those periods.  There are no provided projections in terms of quantity.     

Q:  Can I give quantity ranges for my pricing (example: 1-25 prints $X, 26-50 prints $X)?

A:  Do not use quantity ranges for pricing.  

Q:  Can I attach a sample page of previous work with our bid?

A:  Your quotation should supply the information requested.  

Q:  In each of the requested size categories, would the requirement be for one copy of each image or a quantity of prints from each file?

A:   These are one on one “grip and grin” type pictures with an occasional group.

Q:  What would be the required turn around for the requested work?

A: The desired turn around time would be one week. 

Q:  Is there an estimate of the total number of requested prints (orders) for each period of performance (base period, which ends September 30, 2005 and the option period, which runs from October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006)? 

A: The projected quantities will vary, and no estimate is being provided here.  

Q:  The solicitation mentions the possibility of requesting prints from film based images.  Would there be an estimate of the approximate percentages of the total work which this might include?

A:  An estimated 3 %.

Q:  For the 8X10 montage, will a layout for the images be provided or would we be responsible for the creative design of the page?

A:  Either way.  The person doing the printing will have the opportunity to be creative.  However, DHS can also handle the layout, if that is preferred.  

Q:  It there a specification for the required print frames other than they be wired for hanging? 

A:   A simple black wooden frame.

Q:  Do the required print frames require the additional protection of either glass or plexiglass?

A: No   A protective spray has been used and would be required, as mentioned in Line Item 3 of the SOW.

Q:  When do you expect the contract to be awarded?

A:  Award will be made as soon as a vendor is selected.  Since this amendment will be the final one (and all proposals will now be due by 5:00 Eastern Time, July 13 with no further questions being allowed), award will probably be made no later than July 22.  

Q:  You mentioned the ability that you have to request resubmissions/alterations to a submitted quote. Is it preferable for the quotes to be submitted early so that there is time to resubmit prior to the deadline, or would you allow the resubmission to occur after the deadline should the need arise?

A:  This question refers to the solicitation’s inclusion of FAR 52.215.5, Facsimile Proposals, where a portion of the facsimile proposal received by the contracting office is unreadable to the degree that conformance to the essential requirements of the solicitation cannot be ascertained from the document.  Thus, other than facsimile proposals fitting this description, the only resubmissions that will be allowed will be for vendors who submitted price quotations BEFORE this Amendment posted.  Such vendors will each have the ability to review the posted Amendment and submit a new quotation, based on the information provided in this Amendment.  If such vendor does not submit another quotation, its original quotation will be considered.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO CANCEL SOLICITATION RFQ-CAZ-05-037, IN ITS ENTIRETY EFFECTIVE JULY 11, 2005 DUE TO BUDGET CONSTRAINT. 


The solicitation number for this procurement is RFQ-CAZ-05-037.  Solicitation RFQ-CAZ-05-037 is being advertised as a Request for Quotes. This solicitation and consequent contract award incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-03.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, the size standard for this NAICS code is 500 employees. This solicitation is for the Gas Chromatograph. The specific instrument requirements are: This instrument must have the ability to analyze smoky air samples in 850 ml stainless steel canisters.  This instrument must have two separate setups. No inlets are used, but it must have two 8-or 10-port valves that are air actuated upon starting the run.  Both setups use FID detectors.  The first setup is as follows:  a packed 1/8" carbon molecular sieve column for CO and CO2.  The valve has a 1 ml sample loop and back flushes to the detector (FID A).  A nickel catalyst methanizer is inline before the detector.  This instrument must be able to measure relatively high concentrations in smoky air, up to 1000 ppm CO and 10,000 ppm CO2.  The second setup uses a GS-Q megabore .53 mm column for C1 - C4 hydrocarbons.  The valve uses a 0.25 ml sample loop and pre-column (FID B).  Each setup has a valve for the inlet that switches the pre-column to vent after 20 seconds to flush heavier hydrocarbons.  The current set up uses a temperature program that allows the running of both analyses on the instrument simultaneously.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to correct an answer to a question previously posted and provide answers to additional vendor questions.  The previuos question was: Are the breakers electrically or manually operated?  The FBI incorrectly answered: The breakers are manually operated with electrical charging motors.  The correct answer is simply: The breakers are manually operated.  Additional questions were asked by a vendor.  Those questions and the answers provided are posted herein:  Question 1) What is the CONTROL VOLTAGE?  Answer 1) All Switches/Breakers attach to a 480/277 Buss.  Question 2) What is the expected WARRANTY PERIOD?  Answer 2)  The FBI does not have an expected period for the Warranty other than what is normal in commercial practices.  It is anticipated vendors will offer different warranties.  The proposed warranty will be evaluated toward a best value decision in the FBI's selection process.  Question 3)  Are the breakers "LONG TIME", "SHORT TIME", "INSTANTANEOUS", or ALL OF THE ABOVE?  Answer 3) ALL OF THE ABOVE.  Question 4)  Are FUSES to be included?  Answer 4) No.  Question 5)  Since some are solid state in regards to communications, do they have to match "ALL PRO"?  Answer 5) No.
