<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent to modify Contract No. 263-C-00-01-00007-00 under which Montgomery Watson Harza Americas, Inc. (MWH) Construction Management Consultant (CMC) services to the USAID Middle Egypt Utilities Project.  The modification will be made  using the Other than Full and Open Competition procedures allowed under USAID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR) Subpart 706.302-70 (b) 5 "An award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the government or would result in unacceptable delays." There will be no solicitation documents issued for the proposed action. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the government will consider all expressions of interest received within forty five days (45) after date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

MWH is providing CMC services for the current host country Design/Build contract between ABB Susa, Inc. and the Minia Economic General Authority for Water and Sanitation (MEGAWS). The Design/Build contract, valued at $100,301,000 and LE21,000,000 (Egyptian Pounds), includes the construction of 9 sub-projects:  1. The Fayoum City Kohafa Wastewater Treatment Fayoum City Plant (WWTP), 2. the Fayoum City Pumping Stationsand Force Main Fayoum Improvements, 3. the Beni Suef City Water Treatment Plant (WTP),  4. the Beni Suef City WWTP, 5. the Minia City WTP Expansion, 6. the Minia City Water Distribution Improvements 7. the Minia City Wastewater Pump Station and Force Main Improvements, 8. the Sultan WTP and Water Transmission Main, and 9. the Beni Ibayd Wastewater Collection System. 

It is anticipated that by June 29, 2005, the Physical Construction Phase of the Design/Build Contract will be completed.  The Design/Build Contract shall then move into a six month Commissionning Phase which will end on December 28, 2005, followed by a six month Advise & Assist Phase (including the defects liability period) which ends July 1, 2006.  USAID Contract Number 263-C-00-01-0007-00 with MWH was executed on February 13, 2001 and currently expires on September 29, 2005.  The purpose of the contract modification is to extend the MWH contract for a period of one year from September 29, 2005 to September 29, 2006, in order to allow for the continuation of CMC services through the end of the Design/Build Contract on July 1, 2006 and then to closeout both the Design/Build Contract and the CMC Contract during the remaining three months.  MWH has already started demobilizing a portion of their staff as the end of the Physical Construction Phase approaches.  During the Commissioning and the Advise & Assist Phases, MWH will provide a reduced staff to oversee the work of the two remaining phases along with supervision for completion of the Design/Build Contractor's punch list items.  The contract modification will add $250,000 to the current MWH contract of $16,832,528.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for Contractor Depot Level Support (CDLS) repair services for the Instrument Landing System (ILS), specifically Series 2100.  Prompt repair services are of utmost importance in order to guarantee safety for the flying public.  The ILS 2100 helps the pilot to safely land an aircraft at an airport under conditions of low ceilings and limited visibility.  The use of the system reduces interruptions of service at airports resulting from bad weather by allowing operations to continue at lower weather minimums. Alenia Marconi Systems (AMS) Ltd. is the only known source for these repair services as they are the designer and manufacturer of the 2100 ILS and hold the proprietary documentation on the system. Many of the manufacturing and test procedures for the series 2100 ILS are proprietary in nature and unavailable to other corporations.  AMS is the only current source of this equipment; provides repairs and testing for this equipment; and can satisfy all the requirements for this effort.

<DESC>The Air to Ground Munitions Systems Wing A-GMSW, A-G DASG-Fuzes Program Office, is contemplating issuing a Sole Source Award to Kaman Dayron in Orlando FL. This effort is to procure and receive delivery of approximately 450 fuze trainers, in several variations as stated below, and a proportional quantity of fuze-related component spares to support approximately 9,000 fielded live units to meet a delivery date beginning January 2006 with final delivery 30 September 2006. The estimated cost for this effort is approximately $755,000.  The Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) FMU-152 is a cockpit-selectable bomb fuze employed in MK-80 series warheads (both guided and unguided variations), and both the 2000lb and 5000lb series Penetrator warheads.  Spares for the fuze system would consist of the FZU-55 initiator, power cable, closure ring, compatibility hardware for GBU-15/AGM-130 configuration, and a small variety of sub-tier components.  In addition to the required spares, the government requires procurement of JPF trainers in the following configurations: (1)  The FMU-152A(D-1)/B configuration consists of  a non-explosive fuze with working electronics and the closure ring used for laboratory and pilot familiarization and proficiency training;  (2) The FMU-152A(D-2)/B configuration consists of the FZU-55 initiator, power cable, closure ring, compatibility hardware for GBU-15/AGM-130 configuration, and shipping plug, and used for load crew standardization and weapon assembly familiarization training; and,  (3)  The FMU-152A(D-5)/B configuration is a non-explosive cut-away fuze used for Explosive Ordnance Disposal familiarization training.  The cut-away exposes critical Printed Wiring Boards, switches, and an inert booster pellet replicating the live version of JPF. The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii).  Interested parties must produce or procure for delivery qualified spare parts and trainers and may submit statements of capability (SOC) or capabilities package addressing the following: (1) Demonstrated technical knowledge of the Joint Programmable Fuze requirements for operational performance, interface requirements for JDAM and other guided munitions/general purpose bombs, interface requirements for required US and Allied aircraft, and system safety requirements; 2) Adequate production facilities and production capabilities to produce and assemble the fuze initiator (FZU-55A/B) and power cable, and produce or acquire associated sub-tier components; 3) Adequate production facilities and production capabilities to produce and assemble fuze trainers as listed above; 4) Ability to perform acceptance and other required tests of the fuze initiator in accordance with Contractor developed and Government approved plans; 5) Ability to deliver spares and the fuze trainers on schedule. Responders to this synopsis will not be provided the results of the government evaluation of their qualifying package.  Responses to this synopsis should be submitted for receipt by the Government within 45 days of the publication date and must state whether the potential source is a small business concern IAW FAR 52.219-1. The NAIC Code/Size Standards is 332995/500 employees.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  Interested sources should contact Mrs. Julia Woodard, Contract Specialist, 850-882-8787 ext 2149, FAX (850) 882-1003 or Mrs. Joanie Collins, Contracting Officer, (850) 882-8787, ext 3109, FAX (850) 882-1003.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for services to be procured under FAR Part 15. The 45th Contracting Squdron (45 CONS) intends to negotiate an extension to contract F08650-98-C-0035 on a sole source basis with Sverdrup Technologies Inc, Cage Code 07486, to provide options to ensure continuation of launch operations and support services. A cost-plus-award-fee extension, with cost-plus-fixed-fee O&M CLINs, is contemplated for three 3-month option periods, if required (1 Jul 05 - 31 Mar 06). This contract extension will be a temporary bridge to provide continuous support of present requirements to prevent impairment of processing and launch capabilites. The options will be subject to termination for any remaining portion by the contracting officer if the follow-on acquisition is completed prior to period end. This sole source acquisition is justified under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. Sverdrup is currently performing services under this contract. It would not be practical or possible for two contractors to perform these services at one time. Technical analysis of the time required to learn and become proficient in performing the in-depth services would require an extended phase-in period that would lead to a substantial duplication of costs that would not be warranted given the possibly short duration of the anticipated extension. Other than the incumbent contractor, no firms currently possess the requisite experience, knowledge, and on-station capability to perform these functions. Award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. The present contract is scheduled to be replaced by the LOSC F08650-03-R-0010 on 1 Jul 05. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 561210. The 45 CONS has determined that Sverdrup is the only source capable of providing the necessary services. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Sources who feel they are capable of performing this effort in its entirety should provide evidence of capability prior to the closing date of this announcement.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK for the General Davis Exhibit & Fabrication Support 1.	BACKGROUND 1.1.	The Commanding General of the Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC) desires to dedicate this Headquarters building in honor of General Raymond G. Davis and rename this facility as the Raymond G. Davis Center. 2.	OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE 2.1.	Objective. The contractor shall provide a commemorative display honoring General Raymond G. Davis from an already existing lobby. The contractor shall provide exhibit design and fabrication support for the purpose of re-facing two specific interior areas of this facility that will permanently remain in place for the life of this building.  The contractor shall have extensive knowledge in all aspects of exhibit design, fabrication, problem solving, and management of a project of this level of significance and complexity.   In addition, the contractor shall possess hands-on experience and technical expertise in the management of bringing together a varied array of resources to complete this project on performance, schedule and within budget. 2.2.	Scope.  The contractor shall be expected to present to the government their proposals for materials, timeline, placement, and atheistic appeal. Samples of fabrics, paint, and wood shall be provided with the proposal. The government shall provide conceptual drawings and a biography of General Raymond Davis for the purpose putting together quality proposals. 3.	METHODOLOGY.  The performer shall provide a proposal to satisfy the objectives of this Statement of Work. It is up the contractor to provide fabric samples, paint, and wood samples for furniture. All work performed by the contractor shall be cleaned up thoroughly upon completion of the project. 3.1.	The desired date of completion for the exhibit is 30 June 2005.  However, a firm, realistic completion date that ensures a quality exhibit at a reasonable cost is more important than a 30 June 2005 completion date.  The contractor’s proposal shall state a completion date which it is confident of meeting.  Contractor’s management plan to meet the completion date will be a significant aspect of the technical evaluation process.  Awardee shall notify the contracting officer 60 days before the offered completion date if there is any matter that would interfere with timely completion. 4.	REQUIRED EXPERTISE.  The performer must have the ability and experience in exhibit design in a historical commemorative context. Task 1 Site Inspection & Examination of Ceiling Area: Contractors are to examine the ceiling area where a 10’ x 7’ (approximate size) glass panel will be anchored and mounted from floor to ceiling to establish if there is a need for blocking to support  this panel. Removal of Chair Railings: Contractor will remove the chair rail moldings on the two (2) wall surfaces that will become a part of the dedication areas. Prepare appropriately, all wall surfaces to be re-faced or resurfaced with broadloom carpet material from floor to ceiling.  This wall area will be carpeted with industry standard broadloom measures approximately 314”x 132”. Re-establish Moldings: Contractor will re-establish moldings to match, in color and type, existing wood moldings featured in this environment.   These new moldings will extend from floor to ceiling in both areas of carpeted walls to the left and right to serve as natural transitions and establish a finished edge from carpeted walls to existing painted walls.  Where necessary, any chair rail or other molding that will butt with the newly installed vertical moldings will have to be refashioned, re-cut or reinstalled to establish an appropriate joint. Carpet Installation and Floor Preparation: All carpet installation that will be installed on the floor of the primary exhibit area shall be carpet tiles and will match in color and texture, the broadloom carpeting installed on the wall areas.  The area to which carpet tiles will be installed measures approximately 77’x15’.  Transition strips shall be installed where carpet tiles and ceramic tiles come together.  All existing ceramic tile identified in the area where carpet tiles shall be laid shall be removed and the sub floor prepared accordingly to accept carpet tiles.  Carpeting is to be Commercial Carpets of America Style Sorrento #7R414 or equal. Electrical Work: In the primary dedication area on the left and right walls, discrete electrical outlets shall be established, by the contractor, that will provide electricity for the two (2) exhibit cases and shall be placed, one (1) each in the areas identified.  The outlets shall be placed approximately 14” from the floor and centered on the wall area where the exhibit cases will be positioned.  An examination of the existing ceiling area will reveal a bank of lighting that presently exists.  This existing lighting should be replaced by the installation of baffles to cover the existing lighting elements and to facilitate maximum effect of specialized lighting that will be established to accent the glass panel.  The installed baffles will be painted to match existing ceiling. Also, in the primary exhibit area where the 10’ x 7’ glass panel will be mounted, there shall be special lighting mounted in the ceiling area that shall provide a wash of light on the glass panel from top to bottom. !   The contractor shall propose to the Government methods and techniques for achieving this special lighting effect in the technical proposal. Entry for the Foyer Wall: The entry foyer wall measures approximately 163” x 96”.   This wall will be carpeted with the same broadloom carpeting applied in the primary exhibit area.  Specialized lighting will be established from the ceiling or on the wall where the ceiling and wall come together and generally centered in this area.  This specialized lighting will provide illumination for the Davis portrait and metal commemoration plate that will be affixed to this wall.  These fixtures will be of a brushed white metal, aluminum or stainless steel.  This existing lighting should be replaced by the installation of baffles to cover the existing lighting elements and to facilitate maximum effect of the specialized lighting.   The installed baffles will be painted to match existing ceiling.  A framed image of General Davis will be installed by the contractor using a cleating technique. Glass Panel Fabrication & Installation: There will be a glass panel installed in the primary exhibit area.  This panel shall be of laminated glass and be approximately 10’ 6” in height by 7’ in width by ½” in thickness (10’6”x7’x 1/2”).  All edges of the glass panel shall be polished.  This panel shall be engraved with a quote provided to the contractor by the Government.  The height of the letters shall be approximately 3 ½” to 4”. The style of letter shall be approved by the Government.  The letters shall be filled with pewter, a silver leaf material, or a comparable product that will lend a pewter or silver leaf effect.  Above the text, will be engraved an appropriately detailed image of a contemporary Marine Corps insignia.  Below the insignia there will also be engraved a banner consistent with the banner on the Marine Corps color that reads United States Marine Corps.  The insignia may be filled with gold and silver leaf appropriately.  This detail will be determined by the Government after presentations are!  provided.  The glass panel shall be mounted to the ceiling and the floor by the use of mounting tracks.  These tracks will be a brushed stainless steel or aluminum.  There will also be four (4) stainless steel or aluminum stand-off mounts that will provide additional stability of the glass panel standing off the back wall approximately 6” – 10”.  These stand-off supports will be mounted two (2) each on the right and left sides of the glass panel, and appropriately spaced from the top and bottom of the glass panel on each side.  The stand-off mounts will be capped on the face side of the glass appropriately.  These caps and stand-off elements will be of brushed stainless steel or aluminum.  Upon completion of the glass installation, all drywall work, refinishing and painting of the ceiling area will be performed by the contractor. Creation of a raised letter metal plate. The contractor shall provide a raised letter metal plate featuring the full name and rank of General Davis and the date of facility dedication.

<CONTACT>Carol Brown 202-781-4875 For information about this notice  contact Carol Brown at carol.a.brown@navy.mil; Submit formal response to this RFI to: minesrfi@sirius.navsea.navy.mil
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) seeks information from firms capable of providing naval sea mine development, test and evaluation in support of the United States Navy.  THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE, BUT RATHER A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION from industry that will support the development of a set of concepts to be evaluated in a trade-off study to select the best candidate for a rapid acquisition program for a new naval sea mine.  The information sought herein is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a Request For Proposal (RFP) or as any obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service.  There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise to pay for any ! information submitted by respondents to this request. Objective.  Identify candidate technologies for use in a future intermediate-depth naval sea mine.  Leverage industry expertise to identify and assess candidate technology systems and subsystems that meet the criteria and capabilities described in this request for information. Background.  The United States has utilized sea mines since the time of the Revolutionary War.  Today’s modern sea mine has evolved into an autonomous system that detects target signatures, localizes the target with target motion algorithms, and engages the target by detonating the mine warhead at the target’s closest point of approach.  Recently, interest has developed for using mines to support all the pillars of Sea Power 21, since they obviate the need for force-on-force engagement. The U.S Navy presently has two classes of sea mine systems in-service.  The first class is a series of sea bottom-sitting explode-in-place mines that are effective in waters shallower than about 200 feet.  They include the Mines Mk 62, 63, and 65, commonly referred to as Quickstrike Mines.  Quickstrike Mines contain Target Detecting Devices (TDDs) that contain magnetic, pressure, and seismic sensors to identify and localize targets.  The other sea bottom-sitting mine is the Mine Mk 67, or Submarine Launched Mobile Mine (SLMM) that can be covertly planted from submarines at long stand off ranges.  SLMM uses the same TDDs as Quickstrike.  Because these mines sit on the bottom, they become warhead limited at depths below about 200 feet. At the deeper depths the second class of mine, the Mine Mk 56 is used.  The Mine Mk 56 is an explode-in-place moored mine, where the case can be moored at a pre-selectable depth.  This mine is used in the intermediate water depth regime, generally from about 150 feet to 1100 ft, and can target both submarines and surface combatants.  However, to obtain coverage in depth against all targets, a large number of mines are required at different depths.  Since the mine is large and only deployed by aircraft, an undesirably large number of sorties are required to plant an effective minefield.  Furthermore, the Mk 56 ‘s utility is limited due to its lack of remote command and control capability.  The Mine Mk 56 is scheduled for removal from service in the year 2010. Discussion.  The U.S. Navy has initiated the development of a new mine system to replace the Mine Mk 56 in intermediate water depths.  A spiral development program of a modular mine system is planned, beginning with an initial increment that will integrate existing mature technologies.  Two near-term goals for the new mine are: ·	Minimizing the number of delivery sorties required to lay a minefield.	  ·	Remote control of the minefield.   Minimizing delivery sorties could be accomplished by using a wide-area coverage mine, or by providing the mine with a propulsion system, thus making the mine self-delivering over a considerable distance.   Wide area coverage would normally be achieved by detecting, localizing, and tracking the target at long range and propelling the warhead to the target, although other innovative techniques for achieving target mission abort damage are welcome.  Each mine would cover a larger area, reducing the number of mines required.  A self-delivering mine could use underwater glider or other technologies that allow the mine to travel long distances.  This could be extended to provide a mobile minefield, with the location under a battle commander’s control. The mine system must also be wirelessly controllable in order to render the minefield safe for short periods of time while friendly ships transit the minefield.  This would also allow deactivated mines to be planted ahead of hostilities, then activated should deterrence fail and hostilities break out.  Robust communications and control of the minefield could also be used to sterilize the minefield and/or aid in recovery when the minefield is no longer required. Initially the mine must have the flexibility to be deliverable from a variety of surface ships (delivery system modularity) and from air platforms.  Currently, U.S. mines are delivered by bomber, fighter, or attack aircraft, however delivery from cargo aircraft using para-pack delivery capabilities is also a possibility.  Delivery from submarine platforms is desirable. Initial Increment Capabilities ·	Be placed in water depths of 150 feet and deeper ·	Real time autonomous detection and classification of surface ships and submarines with near zero false alarms  ·	Engagement of targets with a high probability of inflicting mission abort damage  ·	In-water life > 180 days; Active life > 90 days ·	2-way communications between each weapon and the maritime commander to enable command activation, temporary deactivation, detonation, sterilization and/or recovery ·	Deployable from air and surface platforms ·	Modularity to enable multiple mission reconfigurations and future upgrades Future increments could provide increasing capabilities such as: ·	Providing for delivery by submarine or other clandestine means. ·	Expanding the threat target set. ·	Delivery into hostile environments from long standoff ranges in excess of 200 miles.  It is envisioned this would be accomplished with unmanned systems, including Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). ·	Integration into distributed surveillance sensor networks to provide improved targeting through data fusion, cooperative engagement with other kill mechanisms, and high quality target track and classification to improve situational awareness and to provide damage assessments.  Process.  Industry is encouraged to submit information to PEO LMW (PMS495).  The following items are provided for guidance only in submitting input.  Information shall be submitted to PEO LMW (PMS495) via email to minesrfi@sirius.navsea.navy.mil.  All responses are due by 30 April 2005.  The government is interested in unclassified information only.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of Wastewater Collection and Treatment, Potable Water, and Service Water Systems at Picatinny Arsenal, Morris County, New Jersey.
Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operation, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility systems replacement.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm(s) will be selected to assume ownership of the system(s) to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to own, operate, and maintain the utility system(s).  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc. of the systems to assure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, operate, and maintain the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility systems will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offeror's shall be submitted as directed by the RFP.  The Installation and utility systems being privatized are described as follows:

OVERVIEW
Picatinny Arsenal is located in New Jersey’s Morris County, approximately 40 miles west of New York City.  The installation has over 1,000 buildings, and covers nearly 6,500 acres. The Installation Management Agency is the proponent for all Installation infrastructure and support operations at Picatinny. Tenant organizations include the Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Program Executive Office for Ammunition, Program Executive Officer for Ground Combat Support, and the Program Executive Office for Soldier.

Wastewater Collection and Treatment System Description

WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT
The WWTP has an estimated design capacity of 1.0 million gallons per day (MGD), is permitted to treat 0.50 MGD, and presently treats an average flow of 0.29 MGD. Lift Station No. 80A is located at the WWTP and lifts all sanitary waste into the plant for treatment. Wastewater receives primary treatment in two Imhoff tanks followed by secondary treatment using a fixed-film process where fixed nozzles distribute wastewater over rock media. Wastewater is then clarified in a 28-foot diameter secondary clarifier. Primary sludge and fixed-film humus (secondary clarifier sludge) is stored in the digestion compartment of the Imhoff tanks until it is stabilized. Stabilized sludge is then transported by service contract to a federally approved and permitted disposal site.
Treated effluent is pumped off government property for final treatment and disposal at the Rockaway Valley Regional Sewage Authority (RVRSA), a 12-MGD facility in Boonton, New Jersey, five miles away. A standby diesel generator supports the lift station and Picatinny pretreatment facility.

COLLECTION SYSTEM
The existing collection system is generally constructed of vitrified clay and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe with manholes at approximately 350-foot intervals. System piping varies from 2-inch force mains to 18-inch gravity flow sewers. Most of the original system was installed in the 1930s and 1940s. The hilly topography of the Installation allows gravity flow of wastewater for short distances followed by lifting. Flows are generally in a southerly direction except for a small collection area that lies south of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) near the Main Gate. The wastewater collection system presently consists of approximately 137,230 feet of trunk sewers, mains, and force mains. The system includes 19 lift stations of many different designs ranging from ejector systems to simplex guide rail submersible pump designs, to dry well triplex systems.

Potable Water System Description
The potable water system, initially constructed in the 1920s, has a current water demand of approximately 500,000 gallons. The system may include, but is not limited to, wells, pump stations, treatment plant, pipelines, valves, fire hydrants, storage facilities, pumps, and meters.  Although not connected to the Picatinny potable water system, the potable water treatment facility for the Advanced Warhead Development Facility (AWDF) at Building 642 is included in this privatization study solicitation, and the AWDF potable water treatment facility shall be included with the sale of the Picatinny potable water system, should such a determination be made as a result of the solicitation.

POTABLE WATER PRODUCTION, TREATMENT, AND STORAGE
Raw water is drawn from three main wells, No. 131, No. 410 (refurbished with limited capacity), and No. 302 (recently refurbished). Well water contains volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including trichloroethylene (TCE), which are removed in the treatment process.
The water treatment plant (WTP), Building No. 1383, was constructed in the mid-1980s. The WTP is rated at 1.0 million gallons per day (MGD) and serves only Picatinny Arsenal. Water demand presently averages 500,000 gallons per day (GPD) regardless of season. The New Jersey Department of Environment Protection water permit, which expires 30 April 2008, allows a maximum draw of ground and surface water not to exceed 1,788 million gallons per year or 149 million gallons per month. There are no connections that would permit emergency access to the nearby municipal systems.
Well pumps transfer raw water to a primary surge tank at the treatment facility where three raw-water pumps pressurize three 8-foot diameter x 16-foot long greensand filters. Potassium permanganate and soda ash are introduced into the raw-water flow to begin the iron and manganese removal process. Filter media is regenerated using potassium permanganate solution and greens and media rinse and is backwashed into a 16-foot diameter x 18-foot high backwash storage tank. Filtered water then flows under pressure to an air-stripping tower where TCE is removed followed by chlorination. Fluoridation completes the treatment process. Backwash wastes and residuals are discharged into the sanitary sewer system. Finished water is then pumped through a detention tank (completing the disinfection process) into elevated storage tanks located throughout the distribution system. Two ground-level storage reservoirs (No. 1381 and No. 1382) located at the treatment complex are replenished from the distribution system. An adjacent structure, Facility No.1381-A, houses two fire protection pumps that draw water from the ground storage reservoirs and boost the flow in the potable water distribution system when needed. Standby power for the WTP is furnished by a 450 kW diesel generator set with sufficient capacity to operate treatment-related equipment as well as raw and treated water pumps. The WTP operation includes a small laboratory for analyzing water samples. A master meter at the WTP records gross plant output.
The WTP and distribution system is manned seven days per week, eight hours per day. Several critical elements of the water system are controlled from the WTP by a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, utilizing remote terminal units (RTUs).
Three ground storage reservoirs, Tank Nos. 1381, 1382 (mentioned above), and 3214 plus three elevated storage tanks, Nos. 1300, 3141, and 3254 provide a total of approximately 1.5 million gallons of potable water storage. In addition raw water is stored in Tank 1091, a 100,000 gallon elevated tank. Water is pumped to Tank 1091 and is used to supply the water plant, as well as providing water to a series of fire hydrants north of the tank.

POTABLE WATER TREATMENT FACILITY FOR ADVANCED WARHEAD DEVELOPMENT FACILITY (AWDF)
The potable water treatment facility at the AWDF, located in Building 642, is similar to the operation at the Water Treatment Plant at Building 1383. The AWDF treatment facility includes an air stripper with blower, three chemical mixers, and chlorine solution and potassium permanganate for alkalinity feed. The treatment facility also has a green sand filter for iron and manganese removal; monitor equipment for flow, turbidity, pH and cl2; a storage tank; a pressure tank; and, a carbon filter.

POTABLE WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
Due to significant changes in topography, three distinct pressure zones exist within the distribution system: a low-pressure zone (Lower Area), a medium pressure zone (Navy Hill Area), and a high-pressure zone (1300 and 1400 areas). Two pump stations are used in the distribution network: Structure No. 3013, which maintains the water level in Tank 3214 and Structure 1061, an in-line pumping system. A standby generator set, capable of operating a single 100 gallons per minute (gpm) transfer pump, supports Structure No. 3013.
The distribution system is constructed of approximately 217,000 linear feet of water mains and lateral lines ranging in size from less than 2 inches to 12 inches. The system includes main valves, pressure reducing stations, valve vaults, post indicator valves, monitoring and warning systems, and fire hydrants. The majority of the system was installed prior to 1950 and consists of unlined cast iron. During the late 1990s through the present, projects have been undertaken to replace a significant amount of older pipe. The most recent project,   when completed in the next 12 months, will have installed 33,600 linear feet of ductile iron pipe. No service laterals are included in these additions. The new pipe runs parallel to existing pipe and is connected to this pipe at frequent intervals.  Once laterals to the new lines are completed, the old lines could then be retired. 
The number and location of hydrants are adequate for fire fighting. System valve locations are adequate for isolating sections of the distribution system for repairs.

Service Water System Description
Picatinny employs a service water system that is totally separate from the potable system. The system supplies water for industrial processes, boiler make-up, non-contact cooling, fire suppression, building sprinklers, deluge systems, and flush water for numerous restrooms. The system also provides irrigation for an 18-hole golf course; however, the golf course sub-system is maintained by golf course personnel and is excluded from privatization. Service water is neither treated nor chlorinated since chlorine residuals would be incompatible with some industrial applications.

WATER PRODUCTION AND STORAGE
Raw service water is pumped from two lakes on the Installation. Each lake supplies a separate area of the distribution system resulting in two distinct service water storage and distribution systems. The two systems are not interconnected.
Lake Picatinny, with a volume of 560 acre-feet and a surface area of 100 acres, supplies approximately 95 percent of the service water for the Installation. Three centrifugal pumps located in the Power House (steam generating plant, Building 506) pull lake water through coarse intake screens and fill a cluster of ground storage tanks (623, a, b, c, d, and e). The water is then distributed into the service water system, replenishing ground storage Tanks 75, 75a, 639, as needed. Water levels are monitored visually in the Tank 623 cluster with no telemetry or water level sensors currently in use. Raw service water is not metered at the Power House; however, pump run time records are maintained by Power House personnel, which are then translated in estimates of the volume of water delivered to the system. Estimated pumped volumes average 450,000 to 500,000 gallons per day. Pressures in the lower areas of the average 80 pounds per square inch (psi).
Lake Denmark, with a volume of 1,015 acre-feet and a surface area of 280 acres, provides service water for the 1500 and 3500-3800 areas. Two (2) raw water pumps located in Building 1219 pull water through a coarse screen intake and lift it into Tank 1500 for distribution. Estimated flow, based on pump run times, averages 25,000 to 30,000 gallons per day. The water level in Tank 1500 is monitored remotely at the Water Treatment Plant.

SERVICE WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
The service water system consists of approximately 138,000 feet of mains and lateral lines ranging in size from less than 2 inches to 12 inches. The service water system generally serves those buildings with numbers smaller than 100, 100-900, 1500, 3500, and the 3800 group (approximately 110 buildings). The majority of the system was constructed in the 1940s and has been extended to accommodate additional buildings. Since the water is not treated, there are frequent problems associated with leaking valves that do not seat, water odor, etc. Spent service water, not used for non-contact cooling, is discharged to the sanitary wastewater collection system. A large percentage of the one-pass cooling water is discharged directly to the environment at eight EPA New Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES)-permitted outfalls.
Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  Interested sources shall contact Montrez Nicholson at (703) 767-9406 to be added to our bidders mailing list.  A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance on the Internet at http://www.desc.dla.mil/DCM/DCMPage.asp?pageid=246.  The solicitation will be available on or after September 30, 2004.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

SECTION L – INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS OR RESPONDENTS

SECTION L is Attachment 2

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  The NAVAIDS need to be compatible in performance and data protocol with CLIN 0001 through 0007. A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made. Meeting the schedule requirements is one of main the determining factors for contact award. For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as schedule, place of delivery, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.

            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the Schedule of Supplies.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”. The equipment needs to be standardized across the system for logistical, training, spare parts requirements and to enable it to be able to transmit data back to the ACC in Baghdad.  Installation of the NAVAIDs requires that these systems be compatible in performance and data protocol to the systems at Baghdad.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.  If an offeror, or the proposed key employees of the offeror, do not have a past performance history deemed relevant to this solicitation, the offeror will receive a neutral confidence rating.  The neutral confidence rating will be considered in the overall assessment for a best value decision.

	(iv) An overall confidence assessment rating will be made.  The following confidence assessment ratings apply:

Rating				Definition

Blue  			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
exceptional/high confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Green 		Based on the offerors record of performance there is very
good/significant confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Yellow		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
satisfactory/confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Grey			Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
neutral/unknown confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Black		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is
marginal/little confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Red			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
unsatisfactory/no confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

(3)  Price.  

 	    (a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a)(1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	
              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision) 

Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items with its offer. The provision is attached.

The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, as augmented by the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1 to SolicitationW914NS-05-Q-0009:

Question 1:  CLIN 0005 appears to be a duplicate of CLIN 0003. Is it a duplicate CLIN, or is the requirement to provide a qty of 2 DVORs. Answer: CLIN 0003 is a duplicate of CLIN 0005, delete CLIN 0003. There is only one (1) D-VOR/DME.
CLIN 0007 makes reference to connecting the radios to a consolidated terminal. Please provide further clarification as to the 'consolidated terminal.”ANSWER: Consolidated Terminal should be in a console within the ATC Tower. 

Question 2:  In the paragraph immediately following CLIN 0017, the solicitation notice states:
'Provide a proposal with a construction cost estimate for the Basra Airport in accordance with the Statement of work that is attachment 1.  The proposal shall include pricing for a complete system at Basra Airport. The cost proposal shall be in individual line item format.  Costs for all options should be included'. We interpret this to mean that the offeror is to provide a cost estimate for the civil works, which involves siting of the ATC equipment and installation of the items delivered under CLINS 0001-0009, 0011 and 0014 above. We also interpret this to be a request for a cost estimate separate to the pricing requested for CLINs 0001 through 0017, and that is should be a cost estimate as opposed to FFP. Please confirm that this is a correct interpretation. Also, which requirements should be considered as options? ANSWER:  This is not a CLIN but is a statement to indicate that the proposal shall be to supply a complete system. If Offeror has no options, then last line does not apply.  All pricing should be for a firm fixed price contract. 

Question 3: You have requested pricing for commercial products sold internationally, however the SOW requires deliverables above and beyond those that are normally provided commercially, such as drawings converted to metric measurements and produced in Arabic. Can documentation be provided in the English language only? Answer: Drawings in English with metric measurements are acceptable. The solicitation includes 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders/Commercial Items.  This clause invites the CO to incorporate certain clauses by reference, however no clauses are checked. Is it your intent to identify those clauses that are to be incorporated by reference? ANSWER: Yes, they will incorporated by reference in the contract.
Is clause 52.232-30, Installment Payments, likely to be applicable?  ANSWER: Installment or Advanced payments will not be authorized however, the Government will entertain Progress Payments.

Question 4:  CLIN 0014 refers to an “Air Traffic Control tower and/or Approach Control facility”.  CLIN 0007 refers to “limited Approach Control Support”.  There is no other reference to an Approach Control in the other documents.  Since the automation equipment requested in CLIN 0002 does not adequately support a full approach control functionality could you provide additional clarification as to the intent?  ANSWER:  CLIN 0014 Delete “and/or Approach Control Facility.” CLIN 0007 Change “ “limited Approach Control support” to read “limited Approach support”. Approach Radar at Basra is to function as a “stand alone” facility, but it should have the capability to expand-be linked to the Approach Control Facility at Baghdad as part of a nationwide system.

Question 5:  Reference CLIN 0007: Ground to air radio Communication Systems: "Approach Control (APP) be linked to a consolidated Terminal Approach Control (TRACON) located at Baghdad International Airport". Does this mean that just the radio channels (frequencies 121.5 and 243.0 MHz) are to be remoted back to the Baghdad ACC  (TRACON) via the existing VSAT network?  Is there a requirement to remote any of the other 9 radios back to the Baghdad TRACON? Is it valid to assume that a Voice Communications Control Switch (VCCS) is required to assign the radio frequencies to the various controller positions: i.e. Local control, ground control, clearance delivery, and approach control? ANSWER:  CLIN 0007 Frequencies 121.5, 243.0 and one additional VHF (to provide Baghdad Radar Approach Control) are remoted back to Baghdad.  Provide a Voice Communications Control Switch (VCCS) for the following controller positions
Local control, Ground Control, Clearance delivery and Approach control.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:   THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a re quest seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on informati on requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.   POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT:  The United States Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command (USATACOM) is conducting a market survey to determine industrys capabilities to design, develop, produce and support a containerized, deployable Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) Gas-to-Liquid (GTL)contain er..  The Army believes that an F-T plant could be militarily useful in certain OCONUS deployments..   The government requests information on technical concepts to meet the Armys need for state-of -the-art technology in F-T GTL containers..   BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  The Army has recently conducted two military utility assessments of F-T GTL plants that focused on the tactical level.  The first study determined that there is military utility in a barge-mounted GTL plant with a capacity of 14,000 bbl/day.  The assessmen t confirmed a military utility for floating GTL plants by offering: 1. Improvements in supply chain efficiency across the spectrum of military operations by providing commanders and logisticians a complementary alternative to current bulk petroleum supply with an efficient and environmentally friendly fuel, and 2. Cost-effective bulk petroleum supply options at the operational and tactical level, complementing current systems and procedures.  Cost savings and avoidance accrue from reduced reliance on Navy Combat Logistics Fleet (CLF) & Military Sealift Command (M SC) charter tanker assets and related reductions in fuel consumption and charter-hire crewing costs. The second study examined the military utility of a deployable, small footprint plant (SFP).  That study determined that there was military utility in a deployable SFP GTL plant.  However, the characteristics of the SFP that was considered for that study d id not  satisfy notional capability attributes for military utility.  The SFP that was considered was considerably larger than the US Army could use in a tactical situation.  Whether a plant  can eventually be built that could satisfy military capability attributes is to be determined.  What is known is that the state of the technology today does not provide a plant with a small enough footprint to satisfy military utility capability attributes . Military Utility.  The US Army operates at three distinct levels, or echelons: Strategic, Operational and Tactical.  Requirements to support units at each of these echelons differ.   At the tactical level, units are required to be more mobile and they are more dependent upon support from higher echelons.  Although the small footprint plant as currently configured cannot possibly support a tactical unit, future technological advances th at can make an F-T plant more deployable and mobile can be militarily useful.   Support at the operational level, while less mobile than the tactical level, still must maintain some degree of mobility.  Time to set up and tear down a plant for the operational level of support can be greater than at the tactical level. The strategic level of operations is the more permanent level for support.  F-T plants supporting strategic operations can be almost fixed, permanent sites and would compete with the traditional methods of supporting Army units. During the study of the SFP, two operational situatio ns (opsits) were considered.  The two opsits were considered to be representative of future scenarios that could possibly benefit from the availability of an F-T SFP.  At the completion of the study, it was apparent that the SFP considered was not able to provide military utility to the Army. The Army has not yet determined the physical and operating characteristics required to make the SFP militarily useful.  However, there are some general guidelines that provide some indication of what would satisfy the Armys needs.  The general guidelines are shown in the  Tactical Plant Constraints and Operational Level Plan Constraints table below . Available Feedstocks.  There are several different resources available as input to an F-T plant.  These are available in different locations around the world where the US Army might operate.  Fuel sources include natural gas, coal and biomass.  While the f irst two studies that the Army conducted focused on using natural gas as the feedstock to the F-T plant, this market survey is open to any information that industry may have concerning other potential feedstocks. Environmental considerations.  The Army desires to be a good steward of the environment.  In that light, it desires that the by products and waste products of the F-T plant be disposed of properly so as not to endanger the environment.  The ability to miti gate environmental hazards with this system is essential. RATIONALE: TARDEC is conducting a market survey to identify companies and partnerships that can  design, develop, produce and support a containerized, deployable Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) synthesis process.  The Army is looking for the physical and op erating characteristics required to make the SFP militarily useful.  This market survey is open to any information that industry may have concerning other potential feedstocks and the state of art technology that could satisfy military utility (tactical, s trategic, and  operational levels of operation) capability attributes.    RESPONSES DUE:   Responses to the Market Survey are requested no later than April 29, 2005.     RESPONSE FORMAT(S):   ELECTRONIC.  Electronic responses are preferred and strongly encouraged.  It is requested that electronic responses be provided in any of the following format:  Microsoft word, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft PowerPoint.  The maximum size of each e-mail mess age should be no more than three and one-half (3.5) megabytes.  You may use multiple e-mail messages. The subject line must include message 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3, etc., as well as [Organization Name].  Please submit electronic responses to Rebecca Addis at addisr@tacom.army.mil.   All interested entities (e.g. companies, non-profit organizations, and academic institutes), regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.  Partnering with other entities to collaborate and provi de the maximum amount of capability for this endeavor is encouraged.   Questions prior to full response should be posed to Coryne Forest (586) 574-6525 or via email at forestc@tacom.army.mil.  Responses may be mailed to the address below.  The Tactical Pla nt Constraints and Operational Level Plan Constraints for this survey will be posted to PROC-NET (http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/opportunity.htm).

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: The Joint Technology Office—High Energy Laser division(JTO-HEL), through the executing agent: the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Airborne Laser (ABL) System Program Office, located at Kirtland Air Force Base, NM, is seeking to identify qualified private sector vendors capable of conducting research and development (R&D) on a hybrid Iodine chemical laser.  The generator system for this laser is based on nitrogen trichloride (NCl3) chemical decomposition resulting in production of singlet delta.  The intention of this system is to replace the wet chemistry in the chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL) with all gas phase reactions.  The NAICS code for this effort is 541710 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. The Government intends to execute a research and development contract with Directed Energy Solutions who has worked on this technology under a previous JTO contracted effort and anticipates that DES will be the only responsible source capable of successfully competing for a potential contract. As such, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source for the proposed effort under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302.

<DESC>Teaming Opportunity for a Mars Aerial Platform Scout Mission (Mars) NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is performing a technical assessment to form the basis of a possible proposal for the NASA Science Mission Directorate Mars Scout 2011 opportunity. This assessment is focused on conducting scientific exploration of the planet Mars using an aerial platform.  The purpose of this announcement is to enable LaRC to obtain teaming partners to participate in the development of the technical concept, proposal, and implementation of several mission elements in response to the upcoming NASA Mars Scout Announcement of Opportunity (AO).   Specific mission areas where LaRC is seeking partners include (1) design and development of the science instrumentation, and (2) Education and Public Outreach (E&PO).  Exploration of Mars is motivated by a desire to better understand the planet as a possible abode of past or present life, the evolution of the planet's climate, the geology of its surface and interior, and to prepare for future human exploration of Mars.  Mars Scout missions are envisioned to be focused investigations of Martian biological, chemical, and physical phenomena and processes. The Mars Scout mission opportunity was established to provide for innovative, rapid-response investigations. Scout investigations will be led by a Principal Investigator and will be comprised of scientists in partnerships, potentially involving NASA Centers, academia, and industry. These teams will pursue missions of high scientific value utilizing observation platforms of their choice and design.  The Mars Scout AO is expected to be released approximately in April 2006 with the step-1 proposals due 90 days later.  Several proposals will be selected to proceed to step-2 (Phase A). A launch date in 2011 is planned.   LaRC is seeking potential partners for science instrumentation that may include a point spectrometer for surface measurements, an atmospheric mass spectrometer, instrumentation for the detection and mapping of subsurface water, an atmospheric dust monitor, in situ meteorological instrumentation (to measure atmospheric density and the three-dimensional structure of wind near the surface), an ionizing radiation monitor, a solar ultraviolet radiation monitor, a context camera and a video camera.  The context and video cameras and all responses above should have demonstrated space heritage.  Furthermore, LaRC is looking for partners to support E&PO activities that extend the knowledge learned through the scout mission and engage the general public through various forms of media, as well as formal and informal education.  More specifically, LaRC is looking for E&PO partners that have previous experience in educating the public on previous NASA science missions, are willing to cost share, and have a clear approach to marketing the program activities and achievements to a regional and national audience. Responses are solicited from all U.S. industries, academia, non-profit organizations, national laboratories, other government agencies, and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers. If selected through this synopsis, each partner is expected to become a full member of the technical assessment, proposal development, and mission implementation team. LaRC will require each selected partner to provide a letter of commitment. LaRC anticipates issuing contracts or other agreements to the providers of science instrumentation and partners in E&PO, provided the mission concept is selected for implementation.  Interested parties may propose as a partner for any, all, or any combination of the areas sought.  Interested organizations shall provide a short synopsis (not to exceed 5 pages) for each of the areas of interest, addressing the criteria listed below. Responses shall be submitted electronically via e-mail by 5:00 local time, April 15, 2005 to: Chris Edwards at: William.C.Edwards@nasa.gov.  Technical questions should be directed to:  Chris Edwards at William.C.Edwards@nasa.gov; phone 757-864-1555.  Procurement questions should be directed to: Nancy Sessoms at: Nancy.M.Sessoms@nasa.gov; phone 757-864-2471. Responses will be evaluated and partners selected based on the listed criteria in order of importance. The criteria are defined as follows:  (1) Relevant Experience and Past Performance: This criterion evaluates the offeror’s relevant technical experience and past performance in similar development activities including control of cost and schedule.  Provide a description of relevant technical experience including a summary of significant achievements and technical, cost and schedule performance. Offeror shall specifically discuss the relevance of their experience in reference to the design and development of science instrumentation and E&PO programs and/or activities.  (2) Technical Capability, Key Personnel and Facilities: This criterion evaluates the offeror’s technical capability to perform the development proposed, the availability and adequacy of key personnel, and the availability and adequacy of facilities. The offeror shall describe the technical capability, facilities and key personnel available to support the proposal and mission development. NASA will not reimburse organizations for the cost of submitting information in response to this synopsis.  NASA will not pay for technical assessment or proposal preparation costs incurred by team members.  It is expected that the teaming organizations will participate actively in the proposal process and that selection of the proposal for mission implementation would result in contract(s) for the selected partners. This synopsis teaming opportunity does not represent a guarantee to selection of award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA), conceptual designs, technical data, proposal inputs, schedule and cost estimates consistent with the NASA Scout guidelines as described in the AO.

<SUBJECT>Intermediate-depth Naval Sea Mine Request for Information
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) seeks information from firms capable of providing naval sea mine development, test and evaluation in support of the United States Navy.  THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE, BUT RATHER A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION from industry that will support the development of a set of concepts to be evaluated in a trade-off study to select the best candidate for a rapid acquisition program for a new naval sea mine.  The information sought herein is for planning purposes only and should not be construed as a Request For Proposal (RFP) or as any obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service.  There shall be no basis for claims against the Government as a result of any information submitted in response to this RFI.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise to pay for any ! information submitted by respondents to this request. Objective.  Identify candidate technologies for use in a future intermediate-depth naval sea mine.  Leverage industry expertise to identify and assess candidate technology systems and subsystems that meet the criteria and capabilities described in this request for information. Background.  The United States has utilized sea mines since the time of the Revolutionary War.  Today’s modern sea mine has evolved into an autonomous system that detects target signatures, localizes the target with target motion algorithms, and engages the target by detonating the mine warhead at the target’s closest point of approach.  Recently, interest has developed for using mines to support all the pillars of Sea Power 21, since they obviate the need for force-on-force engagement. The U.S Navy presently has two classes of sea mine systems in-service.  The first class is a series of sea bottom-sitting explode-in-place mines that are effective in waters shallower than about 200 feet.  They include the Mines Mk 62, 63, and 65, commonly referred to as Quickstrike Mines.  Quickstrike Mines contain Target Detecting Devices (TDDs) that contain magnetic, pressure, and seismic sensors to identify and localize targets.  The other sea bottom-sitting mine is the Mine Mk 67, or Submarine Launched Mobile Mine (SLMM) that can be covertly planted from submarines at long stand off ranges.  SLMM uses the same TDDs as Quickstrike.  Because these mines sit on the bottom, they become warhead limited at depths below about 200 feet. At the deeper depths the second class of mine, the Mine Mk 56 is used.  The Mine Mk 56 is an explode-in-place moored mine, where the case can be moored at a pre-selectable depth.  This mine is used in the intermediate water depth regime, generally from about 150 feet to 1100 ft, and can target both submarines and surface combatants.  However, to obtain coverage in depth against all targets, a large number of mines are required at different depths.  Since the mine is large and only deployed by aircraft, an undesirably large number of sorties are required to plant an effective minefield.  Furthermore, the Mk 56 ‘s utility is limited due to its lack of remote command and control capability.  The Mine Mk 56 is scheduled for removal from service in the year 2010. Discussion.  The U.S. Navy has initiated the development of a new mine system to replace the Mine Mk 56 in intermediate water depths.  A spiral development program of a modular mine system is planned, beginning with an initial increment that will integrate existing mature technologies.  Two near-term goals for the new mine are: ·	Minimizing the number of delivery sorties required to lay a minefield.	  ·	Remote control of the minefield.   Minimizing delivery sorties could be accomplished by using a wide-area coverage mine, or by providing the mine with a propulsion system, thus making the mine self-delivering over a considerable distance.   Wide area coverage would normally be achieved by detecting, localizing, and tracking the target at long range and propelling the warhead to the target, although other innovative techniques for achieving target mission abort damage are welcome.  Each mine would cover a larger area, reducing the number of mines required.  A self-delivering mine could use underwater glider or other technologies that allow the mine to travel long distances.  This could be extended to provide a mobile minefield, with the location under a battle commander’s control. The mine system must also be wirelessly controllable in order to render the minefield safe for short periods of time while friendly ships transit the minefield.  This would also allow deactivated mines to be planted ahead of hostilities, then activated should deterrence fail and hostilities break out.  Robust communications and control of the minefield could also be used to sterilize the minefield and/or aid in recovery when the minefield is no longer required. Initially the mine must have the flexibility to be deliverable from a variety of surface ships (delivery system modularity) and from air platforms.  Currently, U.S. mines are delivered by bomber, fighter, or attack aircraft, however delivery from cargo aircraft using para-pack delivery capabilities is also a possibility.  Delivery from submarine platforms is desirable. Initial Increment Capabilities ·	Be placed in water depths of 150 feet and deeper ·	Real time autonomous detection and classification of surface ships and submarines with near zero false alarms  ·	Engagement of targets with a high probability of inflicting mission abort damage  ·	In-water life > 180 days; Active life > 90 days ·	2-way communications between each weapon and the maritime commander to enable command activation, temporary deactivation, detonation, sterilization and/or recovery ·	Deployable from air and surface platforms ·	Modularity to enable multiple mission reconfigurations and future upgrades Future increments could provide increasing capabilities such as: ·	Providing for delivery by submarine or other clandestine means. ·	Expanding the threat target set. ·	Delivery into hostile environments from long standoff ranges in excess of 200 miles.  It is envisioned this would be accomplished with unmanned systems, including Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). ·	Integration into distributed surveillance sensor networks to provide improved targeting through data fusion, cooperative engagement with other kill mechanisms, and high quality target track and classification to improve situational awareness and to provide damage assessments.  Process.  Industry is encouraged to submit information to PEO LMW (PMS495).  The following items are provided for guidance only in submitting input.  Information shall be submitted to PEO LMW (PMS495) via email to minesrfi@sirius.navsea.navy.mil.  All responses are due by 30 April 2005.  The government is interested in unclassified information only. In the event that industry provides information to the government that it does not want disclosed to the public, it shall mark the title page with the following legend:  ”This document includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to provide information to the government.

As a result, GSA has required all capital projects to be certified through the U. S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design green building rating system (LEED).  The objective of this proposed effort is to explore a vision for the built environment that is not limited by the paradigms of the current building industry.  What are the possibilities and impacts of these modes of thinking on our project delivery processes? How can our green charrette process be expanded to think about broader issues beyond the concept of sustainability? GSA/PBS would like to convene a meeting of top environmental and green building leaders that would explore these concepts and result in a report providing guidance for future GSA projects and sustainable design, in general.  In this effort, the firm will organize a charrette to explore these concepts. Secure participation of industry, academic and public policy leaders proficient in these areas of investigation; conduct the charrette, including all participant arrangements, securing the intellectual property rights to the results; Document the ideas raised during the charrette and include a plan for implementation on projects and lessons learned; and prepare a presentation on the findings for the Green Building Challenge at the World Sustainable Building Conference in September 2005.  The proposed contract is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons who believe they can provide the services may respond by submitting their capability statement to the e-mail address contained in this notice.  The information provided must be complete including prices as well as a detailed technical description.  Firms should also indicate their size standard (small, women-owned etc.).  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The government will consider all responses received by 12:00pm e.s.t., Wednesday, April 13, 2005.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS TO LICENSE MAGNETO-RADAR FIELD DISTURBANCE SENSOR AND METHODS, FOR METAL DETECTORS AND NON-METAL DETECTORS, DERIVED FROM MICROPOWER IMPULSE RADAR (MIR) TECHNOLOGIES 

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more licensees to commercialize LLNL's current patents and a newly allowed, soon to be published patent covering the Magneto-Radar/Field Disturbance Sensor and Methods, for metal detectors and non-metal detectors, derived from Micropower Impulse Radar (MIR) Technologies and Methods technology.

ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL INFORMATION ON MICROPOWER IMPULSE RADAR (MIR) TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODS CAN BE OBTAINED AT: HTTP://WWW.LLNL.GOV/IPANDC/TECHNOLOGY/PROFILE/SENSOR/MICROPOWERIMPULSERADAR/INDEX.PHP

* The Magneto-Radar is a completely new approach to a motion and range detection sensor for conductive materials whether metal or non metal.  

* Materials may possibly be detected at greater depths and located with greater precision than present technology can achieve by detection at remote distances of very small vibrations such as from a turning fork induced in the targets. Ground balance problems are either eliminated or substantially reduced in most cases. 

* Low-cost potential applications exist in treasure hunting equipment, medical, industrial, mining, security and safety screening, and analytical equipment.  

* LLNL's licensed field disturbance technology with range gating has been the basis for other products and other applications such as range controlled radar motion sensor for security application products selling commercially for under seventy dollars ($70) in the quantity of one.

* MIR and field disturbance sensors provide range to object information while screening out clutter and discriminating from other signals due to the environment, false positives or movement signals outside its range-gated region.

* The MIR or field disturbance sensors can detect small vibrations, such as from a tuning fork, or steel guitar strings.

* Varying frequencies and inter-modulation products of induced magnetic field targets may possibly provide more information to distinguish and identify them from other materials or movements.     

These technologies and methods relate to employing a portable, low-power, battery operated radar to sense and locate (range to object) even microscopic mechanically excited motion or vibration in objects such as but not limited to conductive and nonconductive bio-materials, including ferrous and non ferrous metals, wherein the mechanical vibration and resonance may be the result of mechanical, acoustic, magnetic, optical or electromagnetic excitation.  In many cases, the aforementioned materials can be detected at greater depths and located with greater precision than present technology can achieve. Ground balance problems are either substantially reduced by utilizing either the range gating and sensitive motion features of these technologies in combination or separately.

The MIR and field disturbance sensors are range-gated radars, which provide range to object information while screening out clutter, false positives or movement signals outside its range-gated region.  The MIR and field disturbance sensor can be used in three capacities: (1) non-magneto, (2) magneto, or (3) contrast.  When used in the non-magneto capacity, the MIR and field disturbance sensor provides a substantially improved means of detecting stationary mechanically and/or acoustically (ex. for use in detection between walls in a building) induced vibrating and resonating objects and materials.  In the magneto capacity, the magnetically or electromagnetically induced vibration and resonance of an object can be detected via a characteristic double harmonic frequency.  Third, the radar can also detect the target object through microscopic movement resulting from changes in the size, image or contrast of the object.  

The Magneto-Radar using either LLNL's MIR or the field disturbance sensor is a completely new approach to motion and range detection sensor technology using a bipolar generator, which generates unique double harmonics detectable by MIR or the field disturbance sensor.  The MIR and field disturbance sensors are a new low-cost implementation of a pulse echo radar.  Conventional radar pulses travel at the speed of light and require an oscilloscope for high speed sweeps in even nanoseconds, but LLNL's MIR and field disturbance sensor uses a time expansion technology known as equivalent time allowing it to sweep a million times slower or on a millisecond scale. This range-gated radar operates as a pulse echo system that clocks the two way time of flight of a very short electrical pulse.  It involves using a bipolar magnetic field to induce an eddy current in the target object generating a corresponding magnetic field (detectable phase shift relied upon by traditional metal detectors for determining various materials based on conductivity), transmitting various radar frequency signals to the conductive object, receiving reflected radar signals resulting from motion in the object, and processing the receive radar signals to produce an output signal that corresponds to a harmonic and/or an inter-modulation product of the resonating target object in the magnetic field.  The MIR radar transmits short, ultra-wideband electromagnetic pulses and the receiver is designed to only receive signals from a preset range(s) R.  If there are no changes within or at range R, then the integrated return signal remains constant because stationary clutter signals are integrated as part of the constant return.  However, if anything penetrates the shell, it will change the reflectivity in range R, which causes a change in the detectable return signal attributed to motion.  Through doing this as well, the varying frequencies of the induced magnetic field targets can be more readily distinguished and identified from other materials or movements through harmonic analysis.  For example, when the magnetic excitation varies sinusoidally at a frequency F, the resulting resonance of the conductive object may occur at, but is not limited to 2F, providing a unique harmonic signature that is detected by the motion sensing MIR radar (ex. a bipolar excitation frequency of 60 Hz would result in a harmonic frequency of 120 Hz).     

Since the magnetic field of a traditional metal detector must travel out to the object and then couple back to the generator, a sixth order decrease in signal strength versus range results, forming a formidable limitation in range.  In fact, it is estimated that traditional metal detectors can only detect coins and jewelry at depths of only approximately 8 inches.  In the case of the Magneto-Radar, however, induction of the target and magnetic field emanating from the target object can be obtained via use of the coil of a traditional metal detector or via a more powerful custom magnetic field generator.  The strength of the induced magnetic field is usually directly proportional to the detection range.  Significantly increased magnetic field strength can be obtained by generating short duration, high peak power, pulsed magnetic fields, even with traditional metal detector coils, without overheating the coil because of the extremely short duty cycle of the MIR or the field disturbance sensor needed to recognize movement of the target.

LLNL is seeking licensees with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace.  All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Magneto-Radar/Field Disturbance Sensor and Methods, for metal detectors and non-metal detectors, derived from Micropower Impulse Radar (MIR) Technologies and Methods should provide a written statement of interest and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) 2nd Industry Day
<DESC>This Special Notice is provided for planning purposes only and is subject to change. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and the Government is not committed or obligated to pay for any information submitted in response to this notice, and no basis for claim shall arise as a result of this notice or contractor response to this notice.

The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland is continuing its exchanges with Industry and planning for the acquisition strategy for System Development and Demonstration (SDD) for the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS).  JPALS is a rapidly deployable, adverse terrain, survivable, maintainable, and interoperable Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS)-based precision approach and landing system (on land and at sea) that supports the warfighter when atmospheric ceiling and visibility are limiting factors.  JPALS is a Joint Program with the Navy, Air Force and Army as its participants.  Enabling technologies include Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) with an anti-jam capability, a Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) UHF Data Link (VHF broadcast only for Land Based systems), and an Inertial Navigation System (Sea Based only).

A competitive, performance-based specification RFP for the JPALS SDD effort is currently planned for release late in the first quarter of FY06  (Draft available to industry in July 2005), resulting in a Best Value source selection award late in the third quarter of FY06. 

JPALS initiated information exchanges with Industry in April 2004 with release of an RFI that solicited Industry feedback on Contract type and incentives for the SDD effort, anticipated technical or management risk areas, views on the Industrial base for JPALS-related technology, approaches to maximize hardware and software commonality (including test processes and user interface), Modular Open Systems and Software Communications Architecture approaches, and sparing, support, and obsolescence strategies.  As a result of this RFI, meaningful feedback was received from multiple sources in Industry.  This information is proving relevant and beneficial as JPALS Acquisition Strategies and technical approaches mature.

The next step in the information exchange process was execution of the initial JPALS Industry Day, held on 21 July 2004 in Lexington Park, Maryland.  Industry Day included a full day of JPALS technical and programmatic presentations and concluded with a Question and Answer period.  Industry Day attendance was 107, and included representatives from 31 companies expressing interested in JPALS.  

Additionally, the week of 13 September 2004 was dedicated to one on one meetings with interested Industry partners.  Nine companies took advantage of this opportunity to discuss ideas and lessons learned with the JPALS Government team.  


The 2nd JPALS Industry Day is planned for Tuesday, 3 May 2005.  Details for this event are as follows:

   When:  0900-1600, Tuesday, 3 May 2005 (registration 
          starts at 0800)
   Where: Holiday Inn in Solomon’s Island, MD.

Draft agenda for Industry Day II includes:

1.	JPALS Program Overview and Update;
2.	Update of JPALS ICD and CDD Requirements Documents;
3.	JPALS Technology Development Phase Update;
4.	SDD Request for Proposal and Contract Overview;
5.	Logistics Update.

Industry members are encouraged to suggest additional agenda topics.

Pre-registration is required:  Please call or email the POC below with the names of all attendees NLT Tuesday, 19 April 2005.  Industry Day check-in is between 0800 and 0900 at the conference facility.  The session will break between 1200 and 1330 for lunch in the surrounding Solomon’s Island area.  This will be a paperless Industry day, but a CD with all briefings will be provided for all participants.

Interested Industry partners and potential prime and sub-contractors are invited to attend.  For reservations call or e-mail Ms. Ann Alioto, telephone (301) 995-8076, e-mail at Ann.Alioto@navy.mil.  

Following this 2nd Industry Day, the Joint Government team will be available for one-on-one discussions with interested Industry partners.  The one-on-one discussions are planned for 23-27 May 05 in the Lexington Park, Maryland area.  

If you are interested in this exchange, please contact Ms. Alioto to obtain a reservation for a two-hour (maximum) meeting. 
  
Interested parties should periodically check the PMA-213 web site, https://pma213.navair.navy.mil/jpals_industry, for updated information on JPALS.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items (as defined in Far part 2.1) prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   Solicitation M67854-05-R-1043 is a Request for Proposal (RFP) and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-02 and DFARS Change Notice 20050323.  On behalf of the Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Infantry Weapons Systems (IWS), Optics and Non-Lethal Systems (ONS) this notice requests proposals for the procurement of the Scout Sniper Day Scope (SSDS) for the M40A3 and M82A3 rifles. The SSDS is being procured utilizing full and open, best value competition.  A separate RFP for a scope mounting system will be issued immediately following award of the SSDS. The Government intends to award two separate contracts: one for the M40A3 SSDS, and another for the M82A3 SSDS; however, in the event a single offeror proposes one scope that meets the requirements of both the M40A3 and the M82A3, a single Offeror may be awarded both contracts (reference Section 3.7.2 of the Purchase Description).  The Government anticipates issuing Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contracts (DPAS rated DO-A5) to the successful offeror(s) representing the best value to the Government. The Government intends to award both contracts prior to 15 July 05; however, due to test range availability, the M40A3 SSDS will likely be awarded approximately 30 days prior to the M82A3 SSDS. The provisions at FAR Part 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items apply to this acquisition.  All future information relative to this procurement, including all documentation such as the Purchase Description, Statement of Work (SOW), SSDS Performance Metric Matrix, Contract Data Requirements Lists, Past Performance Matrix, and FAR Part 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Template  will be available to industry through the MARCORSYSCOM website: http://www.marcorsyscom.usmc.mil/sites/ctq/opport.asp.  Offerors shall submit separate technical and business proposals along with (5) product (bid) samples with their proposal for the M40A3 and (5) product (bid) samples with their proposal for the M82A3 as an element of their offer.  OFFERORS SHALL STATE THE PRICE OF THE BID SAMPLES ON PAGE 1 OF THE BUSINESS VOLUME.  Offerors submitting proposals for both the M40A3 SSDS and the M82A3 SSDS shall provide separate proposals for the two scopes (i.e., a business volume and a technical volume for each scope, 4 volumes total). The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with FAR Part 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items as detailed below. Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR Part 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, with their offers. The clause at FAR Part 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.  
CLIN STRUCTURE
The Government intends to utilize the following Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structure, but actual CLIN structure may vary as a result of the individual selected offeror(s)’ proposal(s). 0001 – SSDS, M40A3, or SSDS, M82A3 (as appropriate), includes packaging;
0002 – Miscellaneous Handling and Shipping (TBD – may include overseas locations, such as Okinawa, Japan);
0003 – Replacement parts;
0003AA, etc. – List applicable replacement parts;
0004 – Training package;
0005 – Contractor level repair;
0005AA – List applicable levels of repair;
MINIMUM / MAXIMUM PURCHASES:
The minimum purchase for the M40A3 SSDS is 600 units.  The maximum purchase for the M40A3 SSDS is 10,000 units.  The Program Office initially intends to procure 600 units of the M40A3 SSDS with a potential to procure more as other Government sources show an interest.  The minimum purchase for the M82A3 SSDS is 100 units.  The maximum purchase for the M82A3 SSDS is 7,500 units. .  The Program Office initially intends to procure 100 units of the M82A3 SSDS with a potential to procure more as other Government sources show an interest.    Minimum and Maximum purchase information for CLINs 0002-0005 will be negotiated with the selected offeror(s).  This contract shall be in effect for five years from the date of award.  
EVALUATION:
The Government intends to complete an initial evaluation based on a review of written proposals and an examination of bid samples.  The Government may consider an Offeror’s noncompliance with the instructions set forth in this document to be indicative of the type of conduct the Government may expect from the Offeror during contract performance. If the Offeror intends to modify their bid sample (in the event of contract award) to meet the requirements of this solicitation, the offeror must clearly state the intended modifications in the technical volume of their proposal and demonstrate how the stated modifications will meet the Government requirements.  Following the initial evaluation, the Government intends to establish a competitive range (which may be limited for purposes of efficiency), at which time the Government will conduct optical performance tests, environmental tests, and a Limited User Evaluation (information concerning scope mounts to be utilized during the LUE is detailed in the Purchase Description) and may hold discussions in accordance with FAR 15.306. The Government will reimburse Offerors, whose proposals are included in the competitive range, for their bid samples.  Bid samples, for Offerors whose proposals are not included in the competitive range, will be returned to the respective Offerors at Government expense in a manner similar to that in which the bid samples were shipped to the Government. In making its “best value” determination, the Government will consider the following non-cost/price factors, in order of descending importance (from most to least important):  (1) Technical Capability, (2) Integrated Logistics Support, and (3) Past Performance.  (For the purpose of this source selection, the evaluation of “quality” as a factor is considered to be inherent in Technical Capability and Past Performance). The Government will assign an acceptability rating for and assess the risk associated with each factor for every proposal.  In accordance with Section 3.7 of the SSDS Purchase Description, evaluation credit will be given for technical solutions exceeding mandatory minimums.  The factors listed above, when combined, are significantly more important than price; however, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination increases with the degree of equality in the overall technical merit of the proposals.  As such, price will be evaluated, but not rated.  The Government intends to consider estimated Life Cycle Costs when evaluating price.

TECHNICAL VOLUME CONTENT.  
Offerors shall be required to address each requirement listed in the RFP.  Offerors shall show that their product meets all KPPs and provide any data available to substantiate their claims. Offerors shall further submit a Certificate of Compliance with the bid samples, certifying that all requirements have been met (reference Section 4.3.3 of the Purchase Description). Offerors may use product literature in their technical proposals; however, any ambiguities noted in the technical capability of the products may have an adverse impact on proposal evaluation.  The technical volume portion of the proposal shall be specific, detailed, and comprehensive enough to enable technical personnel to make a thorough evaluation of its contents.  All ILS items shall be addressed in the Technical Volume.  Additionally offerors should address any Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) items such as non-warranty repair, training, etc. in the Technical Volume. 

BUSINESS VOLUME CONTENT.
The Business volume shall include a one-page Executive Summary briefly describing the overall technical approach. Offerors shall include: Contractor Name, Address, DUNS, Cage Code, and Tax Identification Number (TIN). Offerors shall be required to provide price information for each of the quantity increments listed below.  The first 600 M40A3 SSDSs and the first 100 M82A3 SSDSs should be delivered not later than 150 days after receipt of first delivery order. DELIVERY ORDER INCREMENTS:
1-50,
51-100,
101-200,
201-400,
401-700,
701-1,000.
The unit price of each delivery order will be determined by the number of units ordered on a given delivery order.  Individual orders will be issued using the single price for the increment that corresponds to the total quantity being purchased on that order. Additionally, offerors shall provide price information for replacement parts (lens covers, turrets caps, scope covers, etc) associated with their proposed scope(s) under CLIN 0003.  Offerors shall separately price any proposed Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) items being offered under CLINs 0004 and 0005, as appropriate.  The Government reserves the right to purchase all, part, or none of the selected Offeror’s proposed CLS items. All cost and price information shall be rounded to the nearest dollar. Offerors shall include the past performance information, detailed below, in their Business Volume.  

PAST PERFORMANCE:  
The Government will collect and evaluate past performance information using OSD AT&L, A Guide to Collection and Use of Past Performance Information, Version 3 as a guide. 
Offerors shall provide at least three specific examples of favorable, recent past performance that illustrates evidence of their ability to produce, deliver, and warrant this product.  Offerors shall ensure the past performance information includes names of technical and contracting officials, telephone numbers, addresses, e-mail, name of the product purchased, quantities, dates of the resulting contract, contract value, contract number, and a description of the items procured.  Offerors without at least three specific examples of recent past performance (i.e., a new entrant into the market) will receive not less than a "neutral" rating in Past Performance.  Offerors shall include past performance in their Business Volume.  Past Performance information shall be submitted via the past performance matrix.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  Section I.  The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals for conduct of 6.2 Research & Development as described below. Proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidel ines set forth herein. This Research Announcement (RA) constitutes the total solicitation. There will be no formal Request For Proposals (RFPs), other solicitation requests, or other information regarding these requirements.  INTRODUCTION: The Army is anti cipating the development of new centerline turboshaft engines for use in future manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) of the Future Force. These engines will be developed under the DoD/NASA/DOE Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) initi ative.  The Advanced Affordable Turbine Engine (AATE) program will be conducted under the VAATE program and will demonstrate progress towards the VAATE phase II turboshaft/turboprop goals beginning in the FY08 timeframe. The AATE program goals will be to d emonstrate a reduction in specific fuel consumption (SFC), an increase in shaft horsepower to weight ratio, a reduction in development, production and maintenance cost and a design life of 6000 hrs in a turboshaft engine in size class of interest.  In orde r to meet the aggressive goals of the AATE program, significant advancements in combustor technologies will be required.  The performance goals of the AATE program dictate the need for increased temperatures and pressures. These conditions create significa nt challenges for components of the combustor in the AATE.  Therefore, the objective of this announcement is to develop advanced combustor technologies that possess the combination of performance, durability, and affordability necessary to enable AATE tech nology level turboshaft engines to achieve their performance, durability, cost, and life goals.  The offeror must substantiate their notional AATE configuration relevant to existing system upgrades or emerging Army platforms. The notional AATE must also be  consistent with the goals provided in this solicitation.  This program will be executed as a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) preferably that is a Cooperative Agreement pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2358. Therefore, it is the Government's desire to conduct a  technology development effort focused on advanced combustor technologies for AATE level turboshaft engines.  The period of performance for this program is approximately 43 months.  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: This program is focused on the development and demo nstration of the critical technologies needed to maximize the potential for technology transfer to the US Armys AATE level turboshaft engines.  The program shall utilize a notional AATE turboshaft engine design to establish the operational requirements an d potential payoffs of the proposed concepts relative to the AATE engine performance, durability, cost, and life goals.  The notional engine should be designed to achieve the following goals:  SFC (-25%); Hp/wt (+80%); Production Cost (-35%); Maintenance C ost (-35%); and Development Cost (-15%).  Notes:  (1) greater than equal to 6000 hours life, 15000 cycles cold parts, 7500 cycles hot parts (includes combustor liners and turbine blades).  For the combustor liners, the 7500 LCF cycles shall be based on cra ck initiation only (will not include crack propagation); (2) Production cost includes control system; (3)  SFC, Hp/wt, and production cost goal curves are provided at the following link:  http://www.aatd.eustis.army.mil/transfer/AATE_GOALS_BAA.ppt; (4) Mai ntenance and development cost reductions are relative to contractor proposed baseline; (5) Free power turbine shaft engine; (6) Configuration does not include reduction gearbox, but does include inlet particle separator; and (7)  Efficient operation at par t power is desirable.  The offeror shall define the anticipated combustor configuration and performance characteristics consistent with their AATE design.  The offeror shall design, fabricate and perform validation testing of the proposed combustor technologies.  Validation testing shall be conducted in an environment that simulates notional AATE operational conditions and shall be performed to validate aerodynam ic, thermal, and/or mechanical performance.  The Advanced Combustor Technology program will be an integral part of the DoD/NASA/DOE VAATE program.  Although a Government approved Advanced Turbo Propulsion Plan (ATPP) will eventually be required for any suc cessful offerors, such a plan is not required in order to be eligible for an award under this solicitation.  DELIVERABLES:  The contract awarded under this Solicitation will require delivery of the following data items: (1) Program Plan (delivered as part of the first bi-monthly cost and performance report); (2) Design Review Briefing Charts; (3) Test Plans; (4) Test Reports; (5) Bi-Monthly Progress, Cost and Performance Reports, and (6) Final Report.  All deliverable data may be in the format selected by t he contractor.  Additionally, a final briefing at Fort Eustis, VA, shall be presented.  Section II. Award Information:  ANTICIPATED FUNDING LEVEL AND PERFORMANCE PERIOD: Anticipated period of performance is 43 months total with 40 months for the technical effort and an additional 3 months for completion of the final report. The Government funding for the program is $1.2M distributed by fiscal year as follows: FY05/06-$250,000; FY07-$300,000; FY08-$450,000; and FY09-$200,000.  TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT:  Du e to the commercial application of this technology, the Government anticipates an award of a TIA (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358) or Other Transaction for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371) which are more flexible than traditional Government funding inst ruments.  It is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost sharing of half of the cost of the project to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success.  TIAs with, to the maximum extent practicable, cost participation  of 50% are anticipated because the technology has dual-use potential and performers of the program will benefit from commercialization.  Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions.  Cost participation will be considered in acco rdance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) (but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to Other Transactions for Research) accessible at the following link:  http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/co rres/pdf/32106r_041398/part34.pdf. This RA will remain open until 4:00 p.m. Eastern time May 15, 2005. Awards under this announcement are anticipated to be made by July 30, 2005.  However, unless the offeror specifies a different expiration time, proposals  will be considered valid for Government acceptance through 31 December 2005. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part or none of the proposals received. Further, the Government reserves the right to select for award only a port ion of an offeror's proposal (i.e., certain tasks vs. total program). Multiple proposals from the same offeror that address different solutions or that address only part of the problem under the announcement will be accepted and evaluated independently. Se ction III.  Eligibility Information:  Participation in the project announced in this RA is available to qualified U.S. contractors as prime recipient.  The RA is not set aside for small businesses.  Section IV.
