This service is known to be available only from the University of Mississippi, National Center for Physical Acoustics as the only provider  of the service because they have the calibration facilities on-site to calibrate an acoustic instrument for measurement of suspended-sediment concentration.   The USGS is aware of no other source who can provide the above.  Therefore, it intends to make an award to the University of Mississippi, National Center for Physical Acoustics, unless it is contacted by any vendor who believes they can provide the same service.  Vendors are invited to contact the Contracting Officer, (vfloyd@usgs.gov)  no later than June 12, 2007 with an affirmative answer.

<CONTACT>Robert Roberts  Contracting Officer 7039643634     Robert.Roberts@mms.gov;
<DESC>Please read this entire notice carefully as it constitutes the only notice that will be issued regarding the Department of the Treasury, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), Chief Information Officer Information Technology Support Services - Advisory Multi-Step Process. This synopsis is issued by National Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate under the franchise fund authority of the Department of the Interior (GovWorks) on behalf of the Department of the Treasury, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).  GovWorks intends to award a full-and-open, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Information Technology support described in the attached Program Performance Work Statement.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541519, Other Computer Related Services.  The Solicitation/Request for Proposal number is 1406-04-07-RP-67969.  All documents applicable to this pre-solicitation notice will be available via the Internet at http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp.   Interested parties are invited to respond to this Pre-solicitation Notice, which is issued following the procedures described under FAR 15.202.  This method also correlates with the use of a Statement of Objectives for performance-based support.  Telephone requests for this Pre-solicitation Notice will not be honored and no prospective offerors list shall be maintained.  Please note that no questions will be accepted during Phase 1 of the Advisory Multi-Step Process, described below.  The anticipated solicitation (Phase 2) release date is late June 2007.  Please ensure the Request for Proposal (RFP) number and program title (Information Technology Support Services - FinCEN) is referenced on all correspondence.   ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS:  This advisory multi-step process is divided into two (2) phases.  Phase 1 consists of the submission of Vendor Capability Statements, agency evaluations of the capability statements, and subsequent advisory notifications to vendors of their likelihood of being a viable competitor.  Phase 2 consists of the solicitation, proposal evaluation, and award. Phase 1 - Submission of Vendor Capability Statements, Agency Evaluations and Advisory Notifications   This phase includes submissions of Vendor Capability Statements followed by agency evaluations and advisory notifications.  The draft Program Performance Work Statement is attached.   A. Submission of Vendor Capability Statements: Interested vendors are invited to submit Capability Statements describing the information requested in the Vendor Capability Statement Instructions below.  Vendor Capability Statements must be submitted via email to Josie.Guy@mms.gov and Robert.Roberts@mms.gov no later than 2:00 PM, EST Tuesday June 12th.  Responding to a performance-based solicitation, especially one utilizing a PWS that seeks contractor-developed solutions requires a significant effort on the part of contractors to propose to the government.  It also requires a substantial effort on the part of the agency's evaluation team to evaluate an array of different approaches or solutions.  Though the advisory notifications are not a competitive range determination, it is the agency's intent and approach to limit the competitive pool to those select few contractors most qualified to offer a successful solution thus limiting the number of contractors that will go through the time, expense, and effort of developing proposals.  Contractors contemplating competing for this performance-based contract award are asked to carefully review the attached Performance Work Statement to make a realistic self-assessment as to their potential viability.   B.  Agency Evaluations: The Vendor Capability Statements will be evaluated based upon the areas and criteria identified in the Vendor Capability Statements Instructions below.  The agency will complete the Phase 1 advisory multi-step process without communicating with the vendors who provide submissions.  There will be no opportunity for questions during this phase.   C.  Advisory Notifications: GovWorks will issue advisory notifications stating that the respondent will either be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition, or, based on the information submitted, the respondent is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  As explained in FAR 15.202(b), Advisory Multi-Step Process, "?.The agency shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition." Phase 2 - Solicitation, Proposal Evaluation and Award of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract  This phase will be initiated by issuing a formal RFP.  Offerors will be required to submit detailed technical and cost proposals, management plans, proposed performance measures, and subcontracting plans.  The RFP will also identify the first task to be completed.  To ensure that the government receives the best proposal, prospective offerors will be provided an opportunity to participate in a "due diligence" review session where prospective offerors meet with key agency representatives to learn as much as possible about FinCEN's programs, mission goals, and requirements in order to develop a competitive solution.  Vendor Capability Statement Instructions and Criteria The Government only expects capability statements from qualified prime contractors. The capabilities of any potential sub-contractors or partner's will not be accepted.  Instructions:  Firms should respond to the Pre-solicitation Notice by addressing the topics listed below.  The total page number should not exceed five, and headings and topics may be consolidated when practical. 1)	Corporate History/Viability: a brief description of the company, its services, its current financial status, and its viability in support of a long-term initiative for FinCEN. 2)   Relevant Past Performance / Technical Capability: Identify up to three prime contract efforts of similar size, scope, and complexity as the FinCEN Program.  Provide a summary of each contract.  The identified contracts can be with Federal, commercial or other customers.  Efforts cited should be similar to the FinCEN project in the following areas: a)	Successful operation of a Federal CIO Program, minimally valued at $15M annually;   b)	Ability to form a highly effective partnership with the Government to develop strategies, recommendations, processes and procedures, and then implement solutions in support of FinCEN IT initiatives and priorities; c)	Experience with E-Government initiatives development, deployment and management, including Federal and Departmental solutions;  d)	Significant experience in the full breadth of Services requested in the Performance Work Statement paragraph 3 "Contract Management Activities - Tasks" - supported by specific examples;  e)	Ability to design, build, test, and deliver complex technical, operational solutions such as a modernized BSA data center environment, and the ability to address and resolve the data management / data quality issues associated with legacy system environments and both standard and non-standard ETL processes. 3)	Performance-based Contracting: Identify your staff and company's experience with the following performance criteria and your accomplishments: a)   Projects working in a performance-based contracting environment and implementing incentives and/or deducts b)	Projects working with a client to define appropriate performance measures/metrics and then evolving those measures/metrics as the program progresses.

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) FOR WEIBEL RADAR COOLING SYSTEM:


Scope;

The 412th RANS Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base (AFB), CA is currently installing a small liquid cooled Weibel radar system on a refurbished L3 Communications Brashear KINETO Tracking Mount (KTM).  The KTM is a fast response tracker capable of reaching unloaded angular speeds of 60?/sec and accelerations of 100?/sec2.  The estimated top angular speed/acceleration for the KTM loaded with the radar is 40?/sec and 60?/sec2.  The KTM is built with electrical slip rings to allow continuous rotation.  There are no provisions for liquid cooling in the slip ring, so the chiller will have to be mounted on the moving surface.  The older chiller could not withstand being rotated about two axis and did not have the capacity to cool the radar on hot days.

Requirements General;


The contractor shall design, engineer, build and deliver a chiller that cools the Weibel radar system (P/N: MFDR-2100/37) while in operation on the KTM;

The chiller shall be a self contained vapor compressor based technology with an air cooled condenser.  The refrigerant shall cool a closed loop liquid coolant.  The chiller shall provide a circulating pump to circulate the liquid coolant to the radar unit;

The chiller shall have 1800 watts of cooling capacity or greater at an ambient condition of 120 degrees Fahrenheit;

The chiller shall accommodate lower cooling requirements and automatically adjust accordingly so that the radar system will be operating in its normal temperature range.  Depending on the radar target and ambient conditions the 1800 watts may be reduced by a quarter;

The cooling liquid shall be water with antifreeze (glycol) mix;

The chiller shall deliver a flow rate greater then 1 gallon per minute.  The output pressure shall not exceed 60 PSI.  The radar has ?? hose fitting.  There can be a static pressure to accommodate tilting of the unit, but the static pressure shall not exceed 7 PSI;

The chiller shall fit into a space that is 17.7? H x 17.7? W x 28? L.  The hose and electrical connections shall accommodate the KTM and should be designed to fit into the confined space.  Both the 17.7? square sides are generally open to accommodate air circulation and connections.  The maximum weight of the unit can be 100 pounds;

The chiller shall function while undergoing angular accelerations of up to 60?/sec2 in two axes of rotation.  The maximum angular acceleration in each axis should not last more then a half a second for each occurrence.  The angular velocity will top out at 40?/sec and should not last more than 5 seconds for each occurrence;

The chiller shall be insensitive to dynamic orientation.  The chiller will be tilted in the longest dimension from -5 to 95 degrees in reference to ground level.  The chiller will also be moving around in the azimuth plane 360 degrees continuously while being tilted.  The plan is to mount the chiller near the center of rotation in the azimuth axis.  The chiller will be mounted approximately 18? below the center of rotation in the elevation axis;

The chiller shall be designed to withstand occasional vibrations and shocks from typical transportation on unimproved road conditions (dirt and gravel roads);

The chiller shall be built for outdoor use.  The KTM/radar and chiller will typically be covered with a weather resistant fiberglass shell, but could be uncovered at times for up to a week.  Rodents are a problem at Edwards AFB and the chiller shall be built to withstand rodent infestation;

The chiller shall be designed to accommodate the KTM power capability.  The KTM slip ring can accommodate different power requirements.  Two circuits of 120 VAC are available; each circuit is #16 AWG and should support 15 amps of continuous current (30 amps surge for .1 seconds).  There are four #10 AWG slip rings that can support any voltage up to 208 volts.  The #10 AWG slip rings are rated at 25 amps of continuous current (50 amps surge for .1 seconds);

The chiller?s controls shall be easy to turn on/off and setup;

The chiller?s status indicators shall be designed to allow remote access.  A PC Windows based computer (2.8 GHz, 512 MB of RAM, XP) used for controlling functionality of the KTM and radar could be used for remote access of the chiller.  For safety reasons, personnel need to stay 100 feet away from the active radar.  The chiller?s front panel will not be visible to the operator.  Switch closure sensors are preferred for the operator interfacing to other KTM/radar equipment;

Materials, sub-assemblies and manufacturing shall meet industry best practices;

Acceptance testing at Edwards AFB shall be conducted to verify the requirements have been met;

Documentation;

The contractor shall comprehensively schedule and track progress against milestones of the design, engineering, fabrication and delivery;

The contractor shall provide a user manual.  The user manual shall include installation, wiring, interface instructions, troubleshooting guide and periodic maintenance instructions;

Engineering drawings of the chiller unit are NOT a requirement;

These recorders are used to support real-time mission telemetry data recording and playback missions along with testing in the control rooms. Interested parties who believe they can meet all the requirements for the items described in this synopsis are invited to submit in writing a complete quote including delivery FOB destination Edwards AFB CA 93524.

It is the intent of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to issue a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Affymetrix, Inc. 3420 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA 95051, to provide human and dog single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping chips and it?s mapping kits.  The human SNP contains 250,000 SNPs on each chip from various genes in human chromosome. This allows the opportunity to obtain 4 million genotypes per day through the microarray core facility. The dog SNP contains 100,000 SNPs on each chip from various genes in dog genome.  This allows for obtaining 1.6 million genotypes per day through the microarray core facility.  The dog SNP is needed to do whole genome wide association studies to map behavior genes in dog by comparing samples from various breeds in different groups. The objective is to find canine candidate genes responsible for bladder cancer in certain breeds or populations. The human SNP will be used to produce mass amounts of genotype data over a short period of time. This will then be used to find candidate genes responsible for prostate and kidney cancer.  The sole source determination is based upon the fact that theAffymetrix array set has a higher number of SNPs on each chip allowing for higher density scan than what is available from other chips. Also, these chips are the only chips compatible with the equipment in the NHGRI Core facility. NHGRI has a microarray core facility with all of the necessary hardware, equipment, and reagents in stock. They have optimized the protocol and perfected the method for running the assays. Purchasing only the SNP chips with the labeling kits, and utilizing our own core facility will provide a cost savings to the government that can not be recovered through competition. Awarding to another vendor would result in substantial duplication of unnecessary cost.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for One VM-504 Vacuum Spectrometer. NASA/ARC intends to purchase the item from Princeton Instruments/Acton because it is the only vacuum spectrometer on the market with the capability of housing three gratings inside the instrument. The grating in use can be selected under computer control without breaking the vacuum. Changing gratings is necessary to meet our requirements. We need to measure radiation spectra at different resolutions over a wide spectral region- one grating is insufficient and is a characteristic of all spectrometers, not just the VM-504. We will often need to change gratings. Breaking vacuum to change gratings risks introducing leaks and contamination and is to be avoided unless necessary. Manually changing a grating and verifying its installation with single-grating instruments requires several hours. The VM-504 can accomplish this task in minutes and without risk. This is the only vacuum on the market optimized for imaging an extended spatial region. It contains torodial mirrors and other internal optical components to correct for astigmatism. This preserves the spatial resolution from the entrance slit to the image plane. The VM-504 has secondary entrance and exit slits. Diverter mirrors inside the instrument to allow selection of the light path to/from the secondary slits. The secondary slits will be used to mount calibration lamps for wavelength and intensity calibration. The VM-504 is designed for use with our existing Princeton Instruments PI/MAX intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) imaging detector array. No modifications to the VM-504 or array are necessary. The detector software is also compatible with the VM-504 control software. Gratings can be moved, changed and dynamically calibrated to the detector. The operator no longer needs to verify calibration when the grating position is moved back to a previously calibrated position; settings for each configuration can be stored for future recall. The detector and spectrometer software are integrated seamlessly  all VM-504 features are available within the detector software environment: grating selection, center wavelength and scanning functions.   The PI/Acton VM-504 is a catalog item and not developed specifically for our purposes. The delivery time is 90 days ARO. Other vendors capable of designing a custom product for our needs would require longer lead times and higher costs. This would adversely impact testing schedules formulated to meet FY-07 program milestones.  Specific Requirements:  An Acton VM-504 vacuum spectrometer with a secondary exit slit and three gratings will be used to measure vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) shock radiation in a shock tube experiment. The instrument will be used in imaging mode to collect spatially and spectrally resolved data. The spectrograph must meet the following requirements:   	Operation at vacuum wavelengths down to 120 nm 	0.35 m to 0.45 m focal length  	Optimized for imaging capability over at minimum a 26 mm X 12mm image plane 	Multiple gratings that can be selected while under vacuum  	Secondary entrance and exit slits for calibration sources 	One low resolution grating (600 g/mm) blazed for UV wavelengths 	Two high resolution gratings (1200 g/mm and 2400 g/mm) blazed for VUV wavelengths 	Computer control of grating selection and wavelength  	Hardware and software compatibility with existing PI/MAX detector arrays 	Port for direct connection at high conductance to a turbomolecular pump The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 13, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>Modification 02 to BAA-06-01-IFKA 
THIS IS PART 1 OF 2

Reference Basic Solicitation BAA-06-01-IFKA published Oct 11, 2005.

http://www.fbo.gov/spg/USAF/AFMC/AFRLRRS/Reference%2DNumber%2DBAA%2D06%2D01%2DIFKA/listing.html

The purpose of this modification is to set aside research areas solely for consideration from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) under this BAA.  No other changes have been made.  

AFRL/IF and the Information Institute (II) are interested in receiving research proposals for various Information Science and Technology research areas. Areas of interest include innovative approaches and basic and exploratory research projects in the area of information science and technology.  Efforts that will be performed are a part of a Set Aside program for Historically Black Colleges and Universities/Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI). They are intended to be collaborative university efforts designed to provide AFRL/IF with leading edge research that can be applied to a variety of AFRL/IF and Air Force needs and to provide research opportunities for HBCU/MI universities in the primary technology areas listed below. Awards for research efforts will not exceed nine (9) months and will range from $50K - $100K. Additionally, a portion of the research must be performed at the Rome Research Site.

Universities conducting research as part of the II are encouraged to leverage on-going AFRL/IF research programs and activities. The offeror may propose research on one or more topics from the following Core Technology Competency (CTC) areas, but a separate proposal shall be submitted for each different topic. In addition to the following CTC areas other topics may be suggested: (a) Information Exploitation; (b) Information Fusion & Understanding; (c) Information Management; (d)  Advanced Computing Architectures; (e)  Cyber Operations; (f) Command and Control (C2) applications; and (g) Connectivity.

CTC Area 1: Information Exploitation

Topic 1.1 Motion Imagery (or Video) Processing and Exploitation: 

New and innovative technology is required to manage motion imagery data from single and multiple active sensors and extract the relevant information content. The frame rate associated with motion imagery can provide the needed information to discern objects of interest, but it also incurs a processing burden. Techniques are needed to exploit and process this information in real-time or near real-time in order to take maximum advantage of the temporal relevance. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to object detection, object segmentation, object tracking, object modeling, real-time reporting, motion estimation, geo-registration, multi-sensor registration, vision-based multi-sensor coordination/control and processing techniques executed in the compressed domain.

Topic 1.2 Signal Processing Techniques: 

Approaches will be studied and developed to detect and analyze radiated signals in all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum with the goal of determining information regarding the transmission source including the type of signal transmitted and the location. Specific areas of interest include spectral characterization methods, automatic signal recognition, co-channel interference mitigation, geolocation, and multipath mitigation. 

Topic 1.3 Improved Detection of Digital Data Embedding:

Digital watermarking, steganography, and information hiding have rapidly matured in recent years. This technology allows information to be embedded in digital images, audio, video, or other data streams. The wide availability of commercial and free steganographic tools has presented unique challenges in the field of steganalysis, as the number of different programs and algorithms that are available grows ever larger. For this reason, research in steganalytic techniques is increasingly important. Research topics must propose innovative application of mathematical techniques to the problem of steganalysis. 

Topic 1.4 Communications Processing Techniques:

Approaches will be studied and developed to detect, track and process communication signals in all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Specific areas of interest include techniques to detect, track, locate and process signals in dense frequency reuse, changing doppler and various multipath conditions in HF/UHF/VHF/SHF spectrums. Beamforming, null steering, and multi-user detection for co-channel interference are of interest. Wireless RF communications analysis is special interest. 

CTC Area 2: Information Fusion & Understanding

Topic 2.1 Information Fusion:

Researchers will perform research in the areas relating to the ability to develop tools that support situation awareness.  Such tools of interest includes the ability to combine lower level entities/events into groups and situations, the ability to assess these situations in current time (and current impact/threat) and the ability to project the current situation(s) to forecast potential impacts/threats. In order to accomplish this, various disciplines from computer, cognitive sciences, AI and operations research must be brought together. We seek new and interesting approaches in the following areas:  (a) Scalable/Robust Model Analysis and Pattern Matching Techniques for providing Situation/Group Recognition and Interpretation (to include such meta data as uncertainty, severity and perishability); (b) Stochastic Modeling Techniques and Design of Experiments (DOE) Techniques; (c) Metrics for Measuring the Performance of Situation, Impact/Threat Assessment Techniques; (d) Visualization of Complex Relationships; (e) Definition/Development of Situation Assessments; (f) Definition/Development of Threat/Impact Assessment; (g) Identification/Recognition of Adversary Intentions; and (h) Architecture/Frameworks that support Interactive Gaming Environments using the knowledge developed by SA to aid Command & Control (C2) operators in Course of Action (COA) development.

Topic 2.2 Knowledge Bases Integrated with Learning and Reasoning Technology:

Researchers will conduct research in Learning and Reasoning Technology to improve decision-making and realize productivity gains.  This requires that we rethink our information processes and make them more intelligent. Research in cognitive science and human-computer interaction is required in order to design, develop and implement context-sensitive and user-centric systems.  Effective, "real-world" machine reasoning is needed in certain and dynamic environments where a knowledge base is characterized by uncertain and temporally changing information. Techniques are needed to help and define and develop Next-Generation Learning Systems.  Topics of interest include but are not limited to: (a) Cognitive Information Science including Reasoning and Learning; (b) Information Understanding; (c) Knowledge Capture and Acquisition; (d) Knowledge Use and Discovery; (e) Knowledge Representation; (f)  Knowledge Fusion; (g) Knowledge Tracking; (h) Information Privacy; (i) Knowledge Scalability; (j) Knowledge-Intensive Problem Solving; and (k)  Knowledge Architecture Organization and Knowledge Creation.

Topic 2.3 Sense Making:

Researchers will conduct research in reasoning and learning and their support of sense making for the intelligent analysis.  Much of the applied psychological research is grounded within the context of systems engineering and human factors, there exists a strong desire for concepts and performance to be measurable and for theories to be testable. Accordingly, sense making and situation awareness are viewed as working concepts that enable us to investigate and improve the interaction between man and information technology. Within this perspective, it is recognized that humans play a significant role in adapting and responding to unexpected or unknown situations, as well as recognized situations. Accordingly, as we move from concepts, metrics, and analysis to testable theories, we need to attribute the relative contributions of both humans and information technology in our models of system performance. It is further recognized that clear metrics do not currently exist for understanding how humans "make sense" and identifying what conditions facilitate "good" performance. Given the state-of-art in studying this aspect of human-computer interaction, it is noted that research must build from qualitative description toward quantitative prediction of performance, using a range of investigation methods: (a) Observation (non-intrusive); (b)  Subjective investigation (ethnography, knowledge elicitation); (c) Storytelling and anecdotes (knowledge building); (d)  Metaphor (pattern matching); (e)  Scientific method (controlled, empirical hypothesis testing); and (f) Mathematical analysis (baseline modeling, sensitivity analysis). 

CTC Area 3: Information Management

Topic 3.1 Joint Battlespace Infosphere (JBI) Technology:

Information management in a set of intentional activities that maximize the utility of information to the enterprise.  The foundational construct for information management is the information space into which producers place information to be managed and out of which consumers extract it.  Information managers have the responsibility to determining access to the information space and for managing the information held within the space.  Also interacting with the information space are other, federated, information spaces.  The "activities" of information management are organized into six layers of services that surround the information space: information space maintenance, brokering, transformation, quality of service/information, workflow and security.

The Joint Battlespace Infosphere program has historically focused upon the technologies to construct an information space in a reliable, high-bandwidth environment.  Increasingly, however, the focus is shifting towards the tactical environment where resource constraints exacerbate performance issues.  Accordingly, research areas of interest within this topic include: (a) Dynamic policy enforcement among intermittently connected participants; (b) Information dissemination over low bandwidth unreliable links; (c) Information prioritization based upon support for prioritized workflows/processes; and (d) Techniques for federating information spaces. 

Topic 3.2 Context Sensitive Information Visualization to Enhance Situational Awareness: 

Situational awareness is the "fabric" for collaboration and team synchronization in military operations. To be most enabling, its content and the presentation of that content must adapt to the information needs of individual team members, their tasks, and their current situation (context). It must seamlessly bridge the strategic, operational and tactical levels of military operations supporting decisions and actions at all levels. We are looking for researchers to explore the science of adaptive, context sensitive visualization of complex data rich environments, to support team self synchronization / situation awareness and develop the underlying science needed to engineer future military systems.  Research areas of interest within this topic include: (a) National airspace management and visualization; (b) Network status information compiled into useful metrics; (c)  Visualization of complex information systems; (d) Interaction techniques and collaboration tools for multi-user displays; and (e) Various techniques for decluttering data and the visualization of that decluttered data. 

Topic 3.3 Advanced Information Visualization and Human Computer Interaction:

In order to provide airman with an information environment that is dynamic and tailorable based on information needs, we are developing advanced visualizations techniques and interactive displays.  Our technical challenges include fast access to voluminous dynamic data; high fidelity representations; evaluation metrics for visualization success.   Researchers will investigate effective use of visualization hardware and software. Specific domains include: man-machine models; multi-modal interaction; multi-media technology; continuous speech; natural language dialogue; eye tracking and gesture interpretation; intelligent interfaces and adaptive mediators; speech synthesis; 3D audio; untethered pointing devices; 3D graphics and visualization; synthetic environments and virtual world applications (immersive, non-immersive, augmented); display tiling and high resolution media; collaborative interaction and decision making; battlefield situational awareness; battle damage assessment; mission planning and rehearsal; data fusion.

CTC Area 4: Advanced Computing Architectures

Topic 4.1 Advanced Architectures:

Research opportunities within the Advanced Computing Architectures Focus Area span a variety of emerging architectures and applications. The group is uniquely positioned to explore new architectures with FPGA-based emulation capabilities complementing traditional M&S tools.  A complete hardware and software emulation baseline is available for researchers to augment, rather than starting from scratch.  In support, the HPC center features unique heterogeneous architecture comprising a 48 node Beowulf cluster where each node contain dual Xeon processors and two 6 million gate FPGAs. We are presently interested in exploring architectures supporting cognitive systems and architectures supporting improved software producibility and architectures strengthening cyber defense.  Regarding HPC applications research and development, the areas listed below are current areas of interest but others may be proposed: (a) Electronics modeling and simulation?particularly the acceleration of discrete event simulations; (b) Network simulations and related system of systems simulations; (c) "Cognitive" applications featuring a variety of innovative technical approaches motivated from different disciplines such as artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, and neurobiology; and (d) Large scale forces modeling simulations to support evaluation of possible courses of action.

Reference Basic Solicitation BAA-06-01-IFKA published Oct 11, 2005.

http://www.fbo.gov/spg/USAF/AFMC/AFRLRRS/Reference%2DNumber%2DBAA%2D06%2D01%2DIFKA/listing.html
Research directed at identifying unique and improved hardware and software methods employing evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for attacking a variety of hard optimization problems of interest to the Military. Genetic algorithms, genetic programming, particle swarm optimization, artificial immune system, evolutionary strategies and the like are examples of stochastic search methods modeled on biological processes that can excel at robustly searching large dimension parameter hyperspaces that characterize a number of persistently difficult problems associated with scheduling, multi-objective optimization, constrained resource allocation, logistics, multiple frequency antenna design, frequency allocation in communication systems, composing non-interacting DNA code word libraries, and even the design of pipelined hardware and optimizing compilers for computing systems. We are interested in the design, implementation, and application of fast, scalable, parallel, fully embedded instances of EA optimizer/problem execution engines targeted for Heterogeneous High Performance and Polymorphic Computer Architectures. Theory and experiments relative to evolvable approaches to the design, implementation, and use of scalable computing architectures to support cognitive-like processing functions are also of interest under this topic. 

Topic 4.3 Biocomputing:

This topic addresses the merging of biological, nanoelectronic, quantum and photonic technologies to revolutionize information collection, processing and dissemination. This includes: (a) Biological computing architectures, (1) New operation modes and orders of magnitude increases in computing power will require new computer architecture paradigms. New architectures will bring new and novel capabilities. We seek information on new architectures and the unique capabilities they will bring to information processing and communication and (2) New architectures and exascale performance will require new addressing schemes. We seek efforts on contextual and conceptual addressing. The effort should show revolutionary advances. We would establish Figures of Merit relevant to biocomputing. We are interested in comparing the scalability of proposed compute modes. One suggested Figure of Merit would be to compare the achievable quality factor of a proposed biological system with the achievable quality factor in a silicon system of comparable scale. Some biological systems are self-correcting during or immediately after the assembly process. We ask for input on other relevant evaluation points such as Problem Class, Results Latency, Cycle Rate, Operating Environment, and I/O mode; (b) New models of computation - Models will be needed for each new computation paradigm. We seek information on modeling efforts. We are interested in the inclusion of error detection and correction, reconfigurability and fault tolerance. New computing paradigms will require mid-level languages to perform transducing functions. This will preclude the development of entire suites of high level applications for each computing paradigm. We seek requirements for the transducing language and its interfaces. The pace of development for any new computing paradigm will always be compared to CMOS. In order to attain a similar rate of development, we would begin identifying requirements for inclusions in a top to bottom design tool suite. This effort will identify bio-unique requirements and interfaces needed for an effective design tool suite; and (c) Intelligent computing ? 
We seek to identify fundamental factors affecting development of general computing and intelligent computing using biological computing paradigms. Paradigms have been demonstrated which perform NP hard problems. We seek to map biological functions onto other compute functions. We are looking for bio-unique characteristics, which allow increased cognizance.

Topic 4.4 Quantum Information Processing

The field of quantum information processing is multidisciplinary and very challenging, incorporating aspects from physics, electrical engineering, computer engineering and mathematics.  Quantum information processing promises a revolutionary computing capability with impacts on secure distributed simulation, massively parallel computation, protecting information, rapid image processing, rapid optimization of logistics and much more.  But to reach this capability, challenging issues need to be overcome, including general purpose quantum algorithms.  Our objective is to harness the paradigm shift offered by quantum information science to solve classically hard and computationally challenging problems impacting the Air Force.  Besides achieving general purpose quantum algorithms and the solution of computations beyond the reach of classical computers with tractable quantum algorithms, two large problems of interest to the Air Force are the computationally challenging areas of image processing and dynamic planning/logistics.  Our areas of interest are simulating the quantum computing environment, developing new, tractable quantum algorithms from problems that are now beyond the computational reach of classical computation and applying quantum information science to image processing, target recognition, and planning.

CTC Area 5: Cyber Operations

Topic 5.1 Information Assurance Research:

Researchers will conduct research in the areas of Indications and Warning (I&W) for Information Assurance, damage assessment, containment and recovery. Topics include but are not limited to studies, analyses and demonstrations pertaining to: (a) Collection of attack indicators for distributed computer and network systems automated collection of attack indicators; (b) Real-Time fusion of indicators across geographically distributed systems that can act as a front-line of protection for information systems; (c) Development of pathology labs for the analysis of malicious code, viruses, Trojan Horses and new types of software-based threats; (d) Development of fail-stop programs which can recognize an information attack, halt their activity and then safely restart themselves; (e) Dynamic reconfiguration after information attack; (f)  New notions of data consistency, staged recovery based on prioritization, freeing up resources and adaptive system response; (g)  Formal methods as applied to malicious code; (h) Develop methods for detection and analysis/decoding of hidden data and steganography; (i) Develop remote analysis capability for network forensics; and (j)  Development of new and novel active response techniques. 

Topic 5.2 Adapting Fault Tolerance for Cyber Defense:

Successful cyber defense is possible by transforming techniques from fault-tolerant computing. The key notion is to transform not transfer. Recent evidence has shown that merely transferring fault tolerance techniques to achieve cyber defense is fraught with vulnerabilities that an attacker can exploit. Mainly, our transformational approach is that when a fault-tolerant computing technique is placed in a cyber defense scenario the technique must itself be protected from attack or hidden from an attacker or both. We have been extending fault-tolerant computing to enforce the system properties of safety and liveness. When these properties are exhibited at many levels of system abstraction-to the point where they are realized by the system user-then it forms what we refer to as assured computing. Middleware is viewed as a means for an assured computing system to adapt to different fault occurrences. At some level of an assured computing systems, a human is deliberately placed in-the-loop for, among other purposes, post-attack recovery. Impairments to assured computing can then arise from human imperfection. Faults that are non-random and directed represent those induced by an attacker and challenge the transformation of fault tolerance to cyber defense; yet faults (i.e., mistakes) created by legitimate users may be indistinguishable from attacks over short time scales. 

Topic 5.3 Intrusion Detection Models in Large-Scale Network Systems:

The rapid growth of the networks brings challenges to intrusion detection. Anomaly intrusion detection (AID) and misuse intrusion detection (MID) models are two well-known models for intrusion detection. An AID model is implemented by analyzing user behavior and the statistics of a process in a normal situation. On the other hand, signs of intrusion are detected with a database of known intrusion techniques in a MID model. A major problem with current intrusion detection systems is that large quantities of data are needed in order to extract meaningful data from the huge audit information in large-scale systems. We are interested in such technologies as data access, retrieval, extraction, pattern discovery, signatures, statistical processing, database, compression to develop effective and efficient intrusion detection models in distributed systems.

CTC Area 6: Command and Control

Topic 6.1 Effects Based Operations (EBO)/Commanders Predictive Environments:

Effects Based Operations encompass a process for obtaining a desired strategic outcome on the enemy by focusing on specific effects and their causes throughout planning, execution and assessment. AFRL has initiated efforts to develop tools to support the warfighter in implementing EBO. Basic research is needed to further the state-of-the-art in technology to support this important area. Some of the research areas of interest include adversary intent modeling, course of action war gaming, enemy defeat modeling, temporal representation of the persistence and delays associated with effects, real-time simulation interaction, cross center of gravity analysis and modeling, prediction of direct and indirect effects, and evidence accrual to determine indicators of effects.

Topic 6.2 Real-Time Decision Support for COA/ECOA Analysis:

Research and develop High Performance Computer (HPC) based Force Structure Simulation (Wargaming) technology for predictive Course-of-Actions (COA) assessment. Utilize parallel processing resources rather than Monte Carlo techniques to establish real-time predictive simulations. The topic intends to address merging Command and Control planning systems and real-time predictive simulation technology as an assessment tool. Research areas of interest within this topic include: (a) Real-time Course-of-Actions prediction and analysis capability supporting operation planning processes; (b) EBO behavioral models for integration into a force structure simulation. Model development will focus on the ability the analysis the effects and interactions as part of a COA assessment; (c) Enemy Course-of-Action (ECOA) development via simulation models capable of producing intelligent adversary behavior; (d)  Develop Course-of-Action measures of performance and measures of effectiveness (MOPs/MOEs) that can be collected and analyzed for COA assessment; (e)  Data analysis research to fuse in near real time simulation results produced within a predictive framework and accumulated over a large number of COA simulations; (f)  Techniques to provide intelligent data filtering and interpretation of the results for operational planners and strategist; (g) Advanced parallel processing technology applied to Force Structure Simulation; (h)  Techniques for selective creation of probabilistic futures based on statistical variants; and (i) Real-time scenario generation techniques for COA assessment. 

Topic 6.3 Modeling and Simulating Integrated Command and Control Systems:

Military command and control systems are complex, systems of systems that combine numerous applications programs and cross multiple networks, computing systems, and databases. As the Air Force moves toward integrating command and control functions into an integrated command and control system, modeling and simulation offers one approach for exploring new and existing system architectures and system performance. Additionally, modeling and simulation can form the basis for developing methods for exercising and experimenting with integrated command and control systems. Research areas of interest within this topic include: (a) Methods for developing enterprise models of integrated command and control systems that may include new and legacy components; (b) Development of integrated command and control system models, such as Unified Modeling Language (UML) models, to identify information exchange requirements and characterize general system performance; (c) Development of integrated command and control system measures of performance and measures of effectiveness (MOPs/MOEs) that can be obtained via simulation; and (d)  Methods for rapidly developing simulation scenarios for exercising command and control system models. 

CTC Area 7: Connectivity

Topic 7.1 Connectivity Challenges for JBI:

The JBI will provide for the global management, discovery, and sharing of information objects only if the required communications and networking services support it, and do so securely. The challenges and requirements that JBI places on the Global Grid include: connectivity to mobile users; operation over disadvantaged links; supporting Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for information delivery and information processing; supporting applications with real-time/near-real-time/in-time requirements; scalability of services; Multi-Level Security (MLS) and Multiple Security Levels (MSL) models; and information exchange in dynamic Joint/Coalition environments. At the same time, the information assurance aspects of confidentiality, authentication, integrity, nonrepudiation, access control, and availability must be satisfied. 

Topic 7.2 Market-Based Resource Allocation in the Information Grid:

The Air Force's goals to achieve global awareness, dynamic planning/execution, and global information exchange involve the technologies to provide information to the warrior anywhere, anytime, and for any mission. This far-reaching enterprise will necessarily span multiple networks and computing domains of both the commercial and military varieties. As a result, many users with different goals and priorities vie for the communication and computing resources of the information grid. Managing this vast system to assure dependable operation that maintains users' quality of service levels has led researchers to propose computational markets as a means for controlling the allocation of system resources. Economics has always been a factor in engineering. Because it is also the study of resource allocation problems, economics is sought to provide the answer to managing large-scale information systems. By introducing software agents and pricing mechanisms, the computational economy could produce these same phenomena as a real one: admit arbitrary scale, permit a wide heterogeneity of resources, decentralized asynchronous operation, and tolerance of localized failures.

Topic 7.3 Cross Layer Design and Optimization:

Cross Layer Design and Optimization is an emerging communications paradigm, where information is exchanged between the layers while jointly optimizing performance. This effort will focus on the development of theoretical/analytical tools to provide a greater understanding of this paradigm.

Topic 7.4 IFGC, Quantum Communication: 

Quantum Information Science research involves theoretical and experimental works from diverse fields such as physics, electrical and computer science and engineering, and from pure and applied mathematics. Objectives include investigations into establishing quantum limited communications with enhanced security, theoretical and experimental physical demonstrations of quantum information transport under extant or new paradigms and protocols.

Supporting free space quantum communications, we are interested in expertise in wave propagation through turbulent media, image/signal processing and adaptive optics.

Keywords applicable to these studies are: quantum cryptography, quantum entanglement, quantum dense coding, and quantum teleportation. 

Topics of special interest: Laser beam propagation through turbulent media, image processing in turbulent media. Controlled sources of single photons; sources of entangled photons and beams of multiply-entangled photons; single photon detectors; quantum repeaters; phase and polarization controllers with associated dispersion compensators. Free space and fiber propagation budgets, including steering and switching mechanisms.

Topic 7.5 Airborne Networking and Communications Links: 

This research effort focuses on the examination of enabling techniques supporting potential and future Airborne Networking and Communications Link capabilities as well as the exploration of research challenges therein.  Special consideration will be given to topics that address the potential impact of cross-layer optimization among physical, data link, and networking layers, including, but not limited to: (a) physical and MAC layer design considerations for efficient networking of airborne, terrestrial, and space platforms; (b) methods by which nodes will communicate across dynamic heterogeneous sub-networks with rapidly changing topologies and signaling environments, e.g., friendly/hostile links/nodes entering/leaving the grid; (c) techniques to optimize the use of limited physical resources under rigorous Quality of Service (QoS) and data prioritization constraints; (d) mechanisms to handle the security and information assurance problems associated with using new high-bandwidth, high-quality, communications links; and (e) antenna designs and advanced coding for improved performance on airborne platforms.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<ARCHDATE>08132007
<CONTACT>Philip Weckesser, 732-532-2396
<DESC>The Government intends to award a sole source contract for the Production of the Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) Receiver- ADDSI  Receiver-Transmitter, NSN 5820-01-514-1408, P/N A3285962. The Enhanced Position Location Reporting S ystem (EPLRS) is a tactical data radio system that is currently in production and is managed by Project Manager, Tactical Radio Communications Systems, Fort Monmouth, NJ. EPLRS provides a mobile wireless data communications backbone for the Army's Tactical  Internet, provides embedded situational awareness/position navigation, and is a common system for Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps warfighters. EPLRS is a key enabler for network centric warfare. EPLRS supp orts the Modular Army and is interoperable  with US Air Force, US Marine Corps and US Navy EPLRS Radios. EPLRS mobile networks are used by Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS) and Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) host computers for situat io nal awareness and command & control. EPLR S consists of an EPLRS Network Manager (ENM) and radios that can be configured for manpack, vehicular and airborne use. FedBizOpps Numbered Note 22 applies. The Government conducted market research in May 2006 for the full-sized EPLRS and a derivative mode l, Microlight 3G (M3G) and ancillary hardware for the M3G. Since that time, The Secretary of the Army has decided not to proceed with the M3G portion of the requirement. In order to meet the full-sized EPLRS requirement, it was decided that the Government would perform another review of all the reponses to the May 2006 Sources Sought Announcement for only the full-sized EPLRS. All respondents were informed electronically that the Governement had changed its strategy since the May 2006 Sources Sought Announc ement and had decided to procure only full-sized EPLRS. In April 2007, all sources were informed of the Government's determination that Raytheon is the only source that possesses the cabability and knowledge to meet the Government's requirements, and no ob jections have been received to the Government's proposed sole source acquisition strategy. The Raytheon Company is the developer and prime contractor for EPLRS radios and the EPLRS Net Manager. Raytheon Company maintains configuration management of interna l modules and maintains the software source code. The Government does not have detailed documentation on hardware modules, software/firmware or source code. Consequently, the Government does not have the detailed document ation or source code to provide to  a third party. A technical data package is not available. Scope of Effort: The Government's requirement for EPLRS calls for the Firm-Fixed-Price acquisition of up to approximately 3,263 EPLRS ADDSI Receiver-Transmitters (RTs), with inherent production qua lification testing and initial software programming requirements. Contract award is planned for the 3rd quarter of Fiscal Year 07. The resultant contact is expected to consist of a base year and one (1) option year. It is expected that initial deliveries s hall commence within six (6) months after contract award. Production rates should average 200 radios per month with a surge capability of up to 400 radios per month. This will allow the Department of Defense to continue to implement its objective to digiti ze and modularize the battlefield.

<CONTACT>Zedekiah Worsham, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-3560, Fax 301-451-5372, Email worshamz@od.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting market research to determine the capabilities of all businesses (large and small) interested in the opportunity described below.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT COMMITTED TO AWARD A CONTRACT PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION PACKAGES WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. The applicable NAICS code is 561110 and the Size Standard is $6,500,000. Respondents should identify any information they consider to be sensitive or proprietary. Responses will assist NIH in determining whether to set-aside, restrict competition in some way, or solicit offers from all responsible sources; however, all size organizations are encouraged to respond. Should the procurement be set-aside for small business, FAR clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting (DEC 1996) will apply. 

This requirement is to obtain administrative services on a long term basis across all of the NIH Institutes, Divisions, and Centers and Offices. This is a new requirement and there is no incumbent. This requirement will likely be a multiple award contract. The potential contractors for this acquisition will be required to provide up to 500 administrative support personnel gradually over a 5 year period. Since administrative support demand will vary, contractors must be able to scale accordingly. Services required will be performed in a scientific research environment; therefore, administrative personnel should have some experience or familiarity working in such a field. 

A copy of the DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) pertaining to this requirement, which is subject to revisions, is included with this Sources Sought. Interested parties are expected to review this notice and the accompanying DRAFT SOW to become familiar with the requirements of this project.

To make a reasonable determination of available capabilities and vendor interest in responding to this solicitation for administrative support services, NIH asks that vendors review the requirements outlined in the DRAFT SOW and respond with their intent on proposing. In general, while this Sources Sought is not a request for a technical proposal, respondents should provide enough information for NIH to make a determination that the vendor has the capability to perform the same or similar work as identified in the attached DRAFT SOW. 

Please limit your response to no more than 10 pages for sections one (1) through four (4) of the below. Sections five (5) and six (6) are together limited to no more than 5 pages and shall be a separate attachment from sections one (1) through four (4):

1.	Business Information  

a.	Company name
b.	Company address
c.	D&B Duns Number
d.      JWOD Status of the Company (JWOD Company or not)
e.	Socio-economic classification of company (i.e., small business, 8(a), woman owned, serviced disabled veteran owned, Hubzone, large business, etc.) as validated via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Note: All vendors who wish to be awarded a Government contract must register on the CCR located at http://www.ccr.gov/index.asp.
f.	Size (gross revenue, number of employees in company)
g.	Number of years in existence
h.	Company point of contact - name, phone and email address
i.	List of three references to whom similar types of services have been previously provided to include contract number, dollar value, name and phone number of customer. References must be relevant to the requirement and work must have been performed within the three years prior to May 24, 2007. 
j.	NIH encourages teaming or subcontracting arrangements among vendors. If the vendor has any existing or prior teaming arrangements with other vendors to provide this type service, please briefly identify these arrangements and the percentage of work completed by the responding vendor and its subcontractor. Example: 
Vendor ABC acted as the prime and Vendor XYZ provided support as a subcontractor on a contract providing administrative support services to a large federal agency. The contract involved XX positions and the services provided were divided as follows:
Vendor ABC (Prime)	      	                        51%
Vendor XYZ (Subcontractor)	                        49%

2.	Vendor's Capabilities 

A description of the vendor's capabilities to provide the administrative support services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and the attached DRAFT SOW. As demand for administrative support may vary, please include any approaches the company may have used in other contracts (with government or commercial customers) of similar scope to satisfy the surge needs of other clients. 

3.	Management Approach 

The proposed solicitation will not be a personal services contract, which means that the government project officer will not maintain an employer-employee relationship with the administrative support personnel on-site. Therefore, vendors will be required to manage their employees who will be working at NIH facilities. 

Contractor supervisors will be utilized as much as possible during the administration of this contract and will be required to: conduct reviews (or other quality control procedures) with respect to the tasks and projects performed by their employees; address performance issues; gauge (or report on) any applicable performance measures; and conduct performance evaluations of the employees. In addition, contractor supervisors will be expected to engage in at least some of their supervisory tasks on site. 

Please provide an explanation of your firm's capability to provide the type of management infrastructure described above and comment on how communication may be delivered among the government, the contractor supervisors, and the administrative personnel. If your firm is not located near NIH facilities (see DRAFT SOW Section VII), please describe how your firm has managed geographically dispersed employees in previous contracts for similar services.

In addition, provide comments on your firm's capability to implement other elements of a successful management approach that include cost effectiveness, meeting and tracking performance, hiring and retention of long term administrative support, and customer satisfaction. Finally, please describe how your firm has addressed any issues regarding personnel performance in the past. 

4.	Past Experience 

Vendors should state and describe their past experience with a project of the size, magnitude, and complexity in a scientific research or other technical environment as outlined in the DRAFT SOW. Please include the company's past (or current) experience description and its ability to acquire, maintain, and train qualified administrative support staff. 

5.	Contract Type/Performance Based Considerations 

NIH has not determined a contract type for this proposed procurement and is soliciting recommendations on the contract type(s) for the services in the DRAFT SOW based on past experience with similar requirements.

NIH is considering incorporating performance-based measures for these services. Please review the proposed performance measures in the DRAFT SOW and provide any comments/recommendations for the performance measures, standards, and acceptable quality levels (AQL).

6.	DRAFT SOW Comments/Questions 

The attached DRAFT SOW is a draft document and will be finalized with issuance of a solicitation. NIH is interested in your feedback on the attached DRAFT SOW. In addition to providing responses to the questions above, you are encouraged to also submit DRAFT SOW questions and comments. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, NIH will not be able to respond to questions and comments submitted. However, the questions and comments will be used to revise the DRAFT SOW in an effort to provide a value added final product. Additionally, a pre-solicitation conference may be held at a future, to be determined date.

For each DRAFT SOW question/comment submitted, the respondent should provide:

o	DRAFT Statement of Work (SOW) section number;
o	Title of the DRAFT SOW section; and
o	Complete description of the question.

Example:  
DRAFT SOW Section II, entitled Scope of Contract
Comment: State comment, question, clarification.

<DESC>The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).  We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 July 2007.
Anticipated Acquisition Schedule: 

Draft RFP Release	August 06
Industry Day		September 06
RFP Release		October 06
Contract Award	May 07

BACKGROUND

GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the maximum student and instructor training load at each training site. The GBTS has three major functional areas:  Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).

There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training operations.  Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students normal and emergency procedures as defined in the Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) syllabus.  All three utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full functioning replica of the T-6 front seat cockpit and the same Instructor Operating Station (IOS).  Each simulator has no motion.  Each has five PC computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing system and the electronic control loading.  The primary difference in the devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33 degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.  Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 or 10 Visual Control Computer and Image Generator.  Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.  The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five.

The other two ATDs are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer (EST).  The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning instruments and a moving stick and throttle.  It also has a canopy that replicates the opening forces of the A/C.  The EST is a standalone mock-up of the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection procedures.   A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been properly initiated.

The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their associated syllabi.  The T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.  The courseware was developed using Authorware.  Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate training platforms.

TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying training programs (T-6, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)  TIMS operates on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.  Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application server.  The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).  

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components.

On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and NAS Pensacola.  At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of 95%.  There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.  The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.  At the Navy location, the contractor provides manning, sup, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of  95%.  There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.   The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.  At the Navy  location, the contractor provides manning, support equipment and replenishes  Government owned spare parts.  Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are  tracked using Magic Service Desk. On-Site TIMS CAI support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB,  Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.  Each of these locations has CLS for  the CAI labs and a helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters  trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration,  etc.). Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740 Moody AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 709 Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328 Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268 Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672 Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320 Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System  (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS  locations.  The MUSS supports: ATD software and visual database maintenance Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus  Management) Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and  distribution TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location) Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location) FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS The required support will be no less than the support described in the current  environment above.  Simulator data associated with T-6A aircraft drawings may  not be available to the follow-on contractor.  Support will be required to  integrate T-6A and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.  TIMS MUSS  support will be performed at CMM level 3 or equivalent.  The contract type is  anticipated to be fixed price with T+M for travel and spares for TIMS and CAI  labs, but the Government is open to suggestions concerning contract types. Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability  and what might be subcontracted.  Provide experience and knowledge of: 1.  Simulator support 2.  Courseware support 3.  Training management systems and IT systems administration 4.  Software certification level 5.

All  responses to this document are requested NLT 5 July 2004. _________________________________________________ The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson  AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to  perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS)  Contractor Logistics Support  (CLS).  We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 Jan  2007. BACKGROUND GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon  Aircraft Corporation as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS  CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The  GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the  maximum student and instructor training load at each training site The GBTS has  three major functional areas:  Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and  the Training Integration Management System (TIMS). There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training  operations.  Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students  normal and emergency procedures as defined in the JPPT syllabus.  All three  utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full  functioning replica of the T-6A front seat cockpit and the same Instructor  Operating Station (IOS).  Each simulator has no motion.  Each has five PC  computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing  system and the electronic control loading.  The primary difference in the  devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device  (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33  degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.   Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 Visual Control Computer  and Image Generator.  Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.   The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five. The other two ATD's are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and  include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer  (EST).  The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning  instruments and a moving stick and throttle.  It also has a canopy that  replicates the opening forces of the A/C.  The EST is a standalone mock-up of  the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection  procedures.   A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been  properly initiated. The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their  associated syllabi.  The T-6A Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6A  Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how  to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.  The courseware was developed using  Authorware.  Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate  training platforms. TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying  training programs (T-6A, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)  TIMS operates  on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.   Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application  server.  The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual  Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).   CURRENT ENVIRONMENT RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components. On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and  NAS Pensacola.  At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required  manning, spare partsrt equipment and replenishes Government owned spare parts.  Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are tracked using Magic Service Desk.

On-Site TIMS Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.  Each of these locations has CLS for the CAI labs and a Helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration, etc.).

Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740
Moody AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 709
Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328
Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268
Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672
Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320

Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS locations.  The MUSS supports:
ATD software and visual database maintenance
Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus Management)
Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and distribution
TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location)
Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location)


FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS

The required support will not include on-site ATD maintenance support for the Navy.  Excluding the Navy sites, the total support provided will be no less than the support described in the current environment above.  Support will be required to integrate T-6 and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.  TIMS MUSS support will require Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 certification as a minimum.  The contract type is anticipated to be fixed price with some T&M effort.

Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability and what might be subcontracted.  Provide experience and knowledge of:
1.  Simulator support
2.  Courseware support
3.  Training management systems and IT systems administration
4.  Software certification level

BACKGROUND

GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the maximum student and instructor training load at each training site. The GBTS has three major functional areas:  Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).

There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training operations.  Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students normal and emergency procedures as defined in the Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) syllabus.  All three utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full functioning replica of the T-6 front seat cockpit and the same Instructor Operating Station (IOS).

The primary difference in the devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33 degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.  Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 or 10 Visual Control Computer and Image Generator.  Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.  The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five.

The other two ATDs are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer (EST).  The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning instruments and a moving stick and throttle.  It also has a canopy that replicates the opening forces of the A/C.  The EST is a standalone mock-up of the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection procedures.   A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been properly initiated.

The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their associated syllabi.  The T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.  The courseware was developed using Authorware.  Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate training platforms.

TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying training programs (T-6, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)  TIMS operates on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.  Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application server.  The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).

Please note this documents falls under DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractors only to protect technical or  operational data  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code (Contractors only). It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C.  Fisher by COB 08 April 2005. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05)  Logistics response  to Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the  HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of  aircraft or in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before  sending H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s + PRVs? Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the  next unit. 4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines, hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment (avionics)? Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach.  Engines will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to  continue in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based  Maintenance (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there  different concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center? Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the  limited RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL  posture what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario. 6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility  (TSPR): indicate a total TSPR or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and  mission equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL) approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps  (FSRs) a Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate. 7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers; maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors. Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems  Requirements Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update  curriculum and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50 hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance,  man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC). Answer:  Its the users requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason  for replacement of the HH-60s.  If reliability is designed effectively into  the system then this should not be a factor. 9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be  provided with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states All test participants will receive training using the operational training concept  and systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.  Should this be deferred to LRIP/Production? Answer:  No 11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include  Virtual Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA. 12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the  HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that  address this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging  platforms. It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems  AFSC. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 028 (08 MAR 05)- Correction of Capt Thompson+s phone number (reference: Amendment 027) Phone:  937-255-4560 Email:  Gary.Thompson@wpafb.af.mil PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 027 (07 MAR 05) - Draft SRD An updated version of the draft Systems Requirement Document (SRD), Rev 3, dated 7 March 2005 is available for review and comment.

To receive a copy of the SRD, please send an email request to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE  code (Contractors only). It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attention Capt  Thompson, by COB 18 March 2005.  For those prime offerors that request a  "face-to-face" discussion of the draft SRD, we encourage you to contact Capt Thompson at  937- 255-4600 to make the arrangements.  We plan to hold these sessions 29  March through 1 April at Wright Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101  dated 9 July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003). PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for  Information (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year  Government flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy  has changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16 implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why  not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI  63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD  HDBK, Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness Certification Criteria. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05)  SRD RFI extension  and Q+A on SRD RFI SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response  from 11 Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and 3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the  intent, understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed  the CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload  require the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full  extent to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational  Capability (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings  and those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10  (defined as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no  markings or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a  Block 0 requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements  as stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for  Information See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule  reduction efforts The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors  who have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION CHANGES THE DUE DATE FOR SUBMITTAL OF PROPOSALS TO JULY 30, 2007.

The Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS), NIAID, NIH, supports research to identify therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of infections with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and co-infections with pportunistic pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  DAIDS-sponsored researchers are actively engaged in investigating the basic biology of the targeted pathogens, identifying novel therapeutic approaches to treat diseases caused by these infectious agents, and testing therapeutic agents in vitro and in animal models.  Prior to evaluation in clinical trials, most experimental agents require chemical resynthesis, pharmaceutical analysis, and dosage formulation to ensure products are of sufficient quantity and quality to permit proper testing in humans.  DAIDS currently uses contracts to fulfill its needs for these services.  This solicitation will support the DAIDS drug development effort by accomplishing the synthesis of therapeutic agents in small and large scale amounts, some according to current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This solicitation provides for the recompetition of a contract (N01-AI-05402) that was awarded to Starks Associates, Inc. for synthesis of potential therapeutic agents for treatment of infectious diseases.  Over 250 different compounds of interest to DAIDS have been synthesized to date.  Compounds assigned for synthesis include heterocycles (typically containing nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur), carbocycles, carbohydrates, nucleosides and peptides.  The majority of synthesized compounds have been used by DAIDS-supported contracts for enzymatic, in vitro, and in vivo studies.  Small quantities of metabolites have been synthesized for use in mechanism of action and metabolism studies and larger, bulk quantities of compounds have been synthesized for animal studies and clinical trials.  The scope of this effort is small scale synthesis of compounds in quantities required for testing in either in vitro screens or animals, and large scale synthesis of compounds for early Phase I clinical studies.  Some compounds will require synthesis in compliance with cGMP regulations.  This contract will provide resources for the synthesis of promising compounds for the treatment of HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis and other infectious diseases of relevance to the research agenda of NIAID.  The major tasks to be carried out are as follows:  1) Initial transition; 2) Synthesize compounds (small scale); 3) Synthesize compounds (large scale); 4) Acquire compounds for efficacy testing; 5) Ship compounds to NIAID; 6) Provide facilities, equipment, and other resources; 7) Information Security; and 8) Final transition.  This is a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE, NAICS 541710 with a size standard of 500 employees.  It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a period of seven (7) years beginning on or about February 16, 2008.  It is estimated that six (6) full time equivalents (FTE) will be required on a yearly basis.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government. This RFP will be available electronically on/about May 23, 2007, and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and through the FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

Burkina Faso: National ICT Backbone Network Feasibility Study.  The Grantee, the Government of Burkina Faso (GoBF), acting through le Ministere des Postes et des Technologies de l?Information et de la Communication (Ministry of Posts and ICT), invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to implement a National ICT Backbone Network.  The Ministry of Posts and ICT is responsible for the development and implementation of the ICT policy.  In addition, the Ministry is responsible for the postal service.  

The feasibility study will focus on assessing the technical, legal and financial viability of implementing the National ICT Backbone Network in Burkina Faso that will ultimately connect it with neighboring countries.  Burkina Faso is a landlocked country bordered by Mali, Niger, Benin, Togo, Ghana and Cote D?Ivoire. Several of these countries could serve as connection points to undersea fiber optic cable (i.e. Benin, Ghana); others could utilize Burkina Faso as an access point to those cables (e.g. Niger, Mali); and several could provide for regional connectivity (e.g. Togo). 

Specifically, the Terms of Reference for this project include:

1)  Background Research
2)  Requirements Analysis 
3)  Technical Network Design, Equipment Specifications, and Project Costs
4)  Business and Management Implementation Scenarios 
5)  Regulatory and Legal Framework
6)  Project Financing
7)  Environmental Impact Assessment 
8)  Development Impact Assessment 
9)  Final Report 

If the Project is implemented, it would provide high speed broadband connectivity, reaching currently underserved populations and significantly reducing the current prohibitive cost of telephony and Internet services in Burkina Faso. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $350,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).


A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in French and English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, June 11, 2007 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Directeur General des Telecommunications, Ministry of Posts, Information Technologies, and Communication, Ouagadougou, secteur 3 (Ex quartier Paspanga), Avenue de la Grande Chancellerie, Porte 719, Burkina Faso, Email:  binyanogo@onatel.bf, Phone: (226) 50497740, Fax: (226) 50337387. Burkina Faso: National ICT Backbone Network Feasibility Study.  The Grantee, the Government of Burkina Faso (GoBF), acting through le Ministere des Postes et des Technologies de l?Information et de la Communication (Ministry of Posts and ICT), invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to implement a National ICT Backbone Network.  The Ministry of Posts and ICT is responsible for the development and implementation of the ICT policy.  In addition, the Ministry is responsible for the postal service.  

The feasibility study will focus on assessing the technical, legal and financial viability of implementing the National ICT Backbone Network in Burkina Faso that will ultimately connect it with neighboring countries.  Burkina Faso is a landlocked country bordered by Mali, Niger, Benin, Togo, Ghana and Cote D?Ivoire. Several of these countries could serve as connection points to undersea fiber optic cable (i.e. Benin, Ghana); others could utilize Burkina Faso as an access point to those cables (e.g. Niger, Mali); and several could provide for regional connectivity (e.g. Togo). 

Specifically, the Terms of Reference for this project include:

1)  Background Research
2)  Requirements Analysis 
3)  Technical Network Design, Equipment Specifications, and Project Costs
4)  Business and Management Implementation Scenarios 
5)  Regulatory and Legal Framework
6)  Project Financing
7)  Environmental Impact Assessment 
8)  Development Impact Assessment 
9)  Final Report 

If the Project is implemented, it would provide high speed broadband connectivity, reaching currently underserved populations and significantly reducing the current prohibitive cost of telephony and Internet services in Burkina Faso. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $350,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).


A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in French and English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, June 11, 2007 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.

ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS:

5.  VFD compressors ar enot typically specified for outdoor use or dusty environments. Can you describe if this will be located indoors and if the environment if failry clean or dusty?  VFD generate a fair amount of heat and rely on the ambient air to cool the machine and drive.  Improper application will lead to failures and shortened like of the unit.  The same would be true for a refrigerated dryer.  They are not designed for outdoor use in freezing temperatures.  

The compressor will be located in a heated building.

<CONTACT>Janice Bertapelle-Anderson Contract Specialist 303.398.5158
<DESC>QUESTIONS AND RESPONSES FOR RFI 741-07-RI-0004, HEC DOCUMENT IMAGING SYSTEM THE DUE DATE FOR THE RFI IS EXTENDED TO COB (4:30PM MDT) TUESDAY, JUNE 5, 2007. 1)    About the 125K pages per day, how are you scanning and tracking them now.  That is what:        a)    scanners        b)    Document-imaging product(s), and are you using       c)    Internal or outsourced scanning Team?  (A)We do not scan.  All are hand filed w/ internal resources 2)    After assessing and implementing agreed upon product, what are your plans to digitize the 125,000 pages daily?  Internal or out-sourced?    (A) Currently internal, due to IRS and SSA data contained in correspondence 3)    Does the anticipated 60% workload increase include a similar increase in the input page count?   (A) Yes  4)    Do you have plans for addressing the handling of SSN's on these documents [and other secure data] for F.O.I.A. and other public access including web posting?   (A) The income verification files are subject to SSN and IRS security rules.  There is no public access to this information - this will not be viewable on- line. 5)       How large is your Archive (, Paper, Paper Photostats and/or microfiche approx counts), and perhaps more important what are your plans for this Archive?   (A) Multiple file rooms containing 8.5x11 files.  Do not have a count. It is likely, the current Archive would be imaged over a TBD time period. The Imaging system once on-line would begin imaging all incoming correspondence, eliminating the creation of "new" paper files. 6)       Do any page sizes exceed ledger paper sizes (11" x 17")?  IF YES, what is the approximate page count?    (A) No  7)       What are the time constraints (job start/completion requirements) and/or location constraints (can we scan these off-site) using Bonded Couriers for moving hardcopy?   And once again, if there are Archive materials, what are the plans for processing the Archived, and will an off-site scenario be allowed?   (A) All scanning will be done in house using, current staff.  There are no plans to do this off-site 8)  Given the following requirements from the RFI: "3.       The Contractor will provide recommendations for business process improvements stemming from implementation of a Document Management system.      a.       Storage of imaged documents must comply with Federal government security requirements.     b.        Federal Tax Information (FTI) can not be co-mingled with non FTI information.     c.       User capabilities must be permission based.                                                                     d.       Departmental files will be segregated independently from each other.                         e.       A detailed, written report that presents an analysis of business requirements, potential solutions and recommended solutions to include cost/benefit analysis, will be delivered within 10-15 days after assessment and analysis are completed 4.    Assessment and analysis should require no more than 15 days to conclude. The COTR will review and approve final written report prior to contract expiration. The COTR shall assure the requirements of the contract are provided consistent with industry standards."   What is the allowed assessment and analysis period for data collection?  We implore you to consider your internal personnel access/availability, resources that need be assessed, interviews and follow up Q&A, exchanges, etc Essentially, given the need to assess current resources and how they are used to meet future requirements, is VA's HEC confident that a 15-day period to conclude assessment and analysis to be valid?  Is there potential they may consider extending that timeline, or extending the timeline to include follow up to exchanges?    (A)15 days for assessment and analysis is what we believe to be adequate.  If additional time is required, this would be granted.   9)    Will the SOW also include integration engineering services for the DMI systems and any existing systems and/or planned systems in the Administration or those that contractors provide?    (A)  Yes, this likely be the case.  10) One other area of interest with regards to from the RFI: "7.       PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE  a.       At a minimum, personnel assigned by the Contractor to perform required duties must be able to show documented training and have recent experience performing functions in Document Management and Context Imaging, system administration and end user support.   b.       Additionally, the integration of disparate systems to provide a business based process solution is requiredc.       The Contractor must have a minimum of three years fulltime experience in performing similar functions and duties.   d.       The Contractor shall be able to read, understand, speak, and write English." This section does not outline the background of a professional with sufficient credentials for the deliverables requested, among them, especially the highly value-added skills sets for 'integration" that includes "profile based security" to existing and new data.   (A)  Our expectation is you will be able to provide "credentials" and customer references which will demonstrate/ verify your capability. 11)   Has the Administration conducted any internal data gathering to determine and document process requirements for the purposes of identifying areas for automating process and/or process controls?  (A) Yes 12) Can you provide a brief description of the HEC's current process(es), if any, for converting paper documents to electronic form.  What standard is used, for example, PDF, TIFF? Is it a mixture of types? (A) We do not convert documents.  13)   Please describe the HEC's current process(es), if any, for searching and retrieving documents.   (A) They are retrieved from a file room based on case #, name, SSN 14)   What operating system(s) and tools (for example, Acrobat or MS Office) is the HEC standardized on?  (A) MS office 15)  Have you considered having the current and future processes assessed, analyzed, documented, and accepted by the HEC, and then issuing this information in a SSN for the document imaging technology solution?  (A) Yes to all, except, we likely will not want to use SSN 15)  The request for information states - "Assessment and analysis should require no more than 15 days to conclude."  Is the Assessment and Analysis contractor precluded from bidding on the implementation contract as this could be perceived as a conflict of interest?   (A)  No 16)  Shouldn't the RFI request sources (companies) who have the capabilities and the interest in providing a total solution; Analysis, Assessment, Recommendation and Implementation versus seeking companies to do only the Assessment and Analysis?  This would allow the VA to only prepare and submit one Request for Proposal versus two as this RFI indicates.  (A)  The intent of this RFI is for Analysis, Assessment, and Recommendation. 17)   We assume the study will be conducted at the HEC in Atlanta, GA. If so, how long do you anticipate the study will take?  (A)  Yes, in Atlanta. Assessment and Analysis should require 3-5 days on site, a possible 1-2 days for a follow-up visit if needed. Our expectation is delivery of a Assessment, Analysis and Recommendations with in 30 days 18)   Is there a contract period and dollar value associated with both the study and the potential RFP for the equipment and implementation?  (A)  No. 19)  is there an incumbent currently performing the work? If so, who is the incumbent and when does their contract expire?  (A)  No 20) Is there a page limit required for the RFI response?  (A)  No 21) Are you expecting cost information for the scope of work: that is, overall cost and cost breakdown for what we consider are the SOW components? (A)  Not at this time. 22) Is this going to be a small business set-aside project or are you assessing that depending on the responses received? (A) To be determined 23) What is the impact if we do not respond to the RFI but desire to respond to the RFP?  (A)None. 24) If we do respond to the RFI and after review, you believe that we would not be a viable candidate for the RFP, will you let us know that?   (A) Yes

<CONTACT>Bettye Lou Mahoney Contract Specialist 9169785570     bmahoney@mp.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation is issuing this announcement to identify potential certified HUBZone and/or 8(a) Small Business concerns who would be interested in performing road repairs at Glory Hole Recreation Area Access Roads and New Melones Dam Access Roads. All work is located at the Glory Hole Recreation Area, New Melones Lake, approximately 55 miles east of Stockton, California and 15 miles northwest of Sonora on State Highway 49 in Calaveras County, California.  The principal components of the work to be performed under the specifications include the following:  removal and replacement of asphalt concrete and aggregate base material, sealing of roadway and parking lot surfaces, re-striping, and the repair of guardrails and shoulders.  The Glory Hole Recreational Area will also require the installation of French drains, a paved walkway and corrugated metal pipe at the Angel's Creek parking lot, repair and widening of bituminous down drains, erosion repair, the paving of three parking lots, grinding and compacting of pavement to conform to proper grades, and the construction of new speed bumps at the entrance station.  Also, reconfiguration of parking areas at the Angel's Creek parking lot including removal and installation of  concrete curbs to accommodate angled parking.  Additional work at the New Melones Dam Access Roads includes erosion repair near the gate house, repairs of two sloughed embankment areas, installation of new corrugated metal pipes at the damaged embankment areas, and the construction of new curbs.  It is anticipated that award of the work will occur in August 2007. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237310 and the related small business size standard in dollars is $31.0. The estimated cost of this project is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.  This procurement is being considered for 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone and/or 8(a) small business concerns; however, all interested parties are requested to respond.  If adequate interest or sufficient supporting documentation is not received from HUBZone and/or 8(a) concerns, the solicitation may be issued as a small business set-aside or unrestricted basis without further notice or may be canceled.  This procurement will require 100% performance and payment bonds.  Interested parties should include the following information in their response:  (a) Business name, address, cage code, size classification based on NAICS size standard, socioeconomic classification (i.e. HUBZone and/or 8(a)), and a point of contact.  (b) A copy of the certificate issued by the SBA of your qualifications as a HUBZone and/or 8(a) small business concern.  (c) A positive statement of your intention to submit an offer for this solicitation as a prime contractor.  (d) Evidence of your Bonding capacity and (e) Evidence of your experience performing work similar in type and scope to include:  contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts and points of contacts with telephone numbers and past experience regarding the construction or rehabilitation of concrete dams of similar type work described above within the past 5 years.  In addition, include attachments cataloging the company's equipment assets, personnel resources and financial resources that demonstrate company responsibility and capability to perform required work.  This notice is not a request for proposal and the information presented in this announcement will not obligate the Bureau of Reclamation in any manner.  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102, apply to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Information on annual Representations and Certifications can be obtained via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this notice, by e-mail to bmahoney@mp.usbr.gov not later than the close of business on June 8, 2007.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  The Government is currently conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10 to identify potential sources to provide the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market.  All information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is voluntary and the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.  Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately and will be controlled and secured.  All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.

The Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) anticipates pursuing the initial acquisition of one hundred thousand (100,000) treatment courses of a medical countermeasure for neutropenia arising as a consequence of acute radiation exposure (acute radiation syndrome, ARS).  It is anticipated the product will be licensed/approved for ARS use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and will be stable for at least 24 months.  There will be options for up to an additional one hundred thousand (100,000) treatment courses to meet the USG requirement of at least 200,000 treatment courses.  Potential respondents to this Sources Sought Notice (SSN) shall meet the following specific criteria:

1.  An active FDA Investigational New Drug (IND) application, from a product already licensed for another indication, filed and not currently on clinical hold, for the suggested product.  Inclusion of the products Phase 1 and 2 clinical safety data, if completed, is desirable; this may represent safety data from an already licensed product for another indication.

2.  The company shall demonstrate validated bulk drug substance (BDS) production for the suggested product and demonstrate manufacturing capability at the proposed commercial scale.

3.  The respondent shall provide efficacy data for the product in appropriate animal models, with the goal of increased survival and improvement of peripheral circulating neutrophil counts, following administration of the product no earlier than 24 hours after whole body irradiation challenges in models sufficient to demonstrate lethality.

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) FOR UPGRADE A PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENTS TRACKING SYSTEM (PETS)

1.	Scope

The contractor shall produce; test and deliver the additional features and functional upgrade to existing Edwards GPS Personnel and Equipments Tracking software (GPS Flight Team Software) and hardware in accordance with this Statement of Work (SOW). This upgrade will be for ground Range operational safety use. 


	1.1 Background

The P/ETS is a hand held radio system consisting of a GPS receiver/transmitter integrated into an RF transmitter. The transmitter radiates on 900 MHz with 100-mw power output and is received by a GPS receiver. This receiver interfaces to Edwards AFB ground fiber network through an Ethernet connection. The system is compliant with Part 15 of FCC Rules regarding frequency and spectrum use. This system will provide users with the ability to track multiple, independent objects (200 OBJ) across wide areas of the PIRA Ranges (East and West) in real-time. The position information is displayed on a standard PC hosting the GPS-TEAM mapping software. This software displays a map overlay upon which the Range map has been laid. Users will appear as a beacon (RF reference signal) on the Edwards AFB map, updating their position often enough to allow the operator to track the vehicles or personnel movements in real-time at Downfall or any other location with access to the network. The block diagram below shows subsystem layout of the GPS-Flight-STXe transmitter platform, which shows how it sends data to the ground over the air link. On the ground, a PC connects to the RX-Base receiver unit to display the data onscreen. 


2.	General Requirements

	2.1 Software requirements
The contractor shall modify the existing GPS Flight Team Software, test, and deliver working map display and the associated hardware and user interfaces to support map display, map manipulation, navigation, and map creation from positional data that contains all the features and meets (or exceeds) all of the functional software performance requirements with the following characteristics:

2.1.1 Recording and Storing Data
?	Develop a recording subsystem that will store all recorded data to a local file archiving on a day-day basis creating a file that is time stamped each day, and can be saved. 
?	The file will contain the Trac-ID data for all devices being tracked base wide, run unattended, and record data even if the GPS-Team software is not running or is being used for other purposes (this will be a service with its own schedule priority).
?	User must be able to enter the settings menu and turn on ?archive service? allowing control over this application.
?	User must be able to set the time interval that new files are saved and select time length in hours from 1 to 24 hour intervals.
?	The archive file name will be named by their (date)/ (Hour) for easy sorting.  
?	Recorded files may be stored on a PC and shared using windows file sharing to enable other networked PC with access to the file to play it back using another copy of GPS-Team software.
?	The playback should try to use the same maps and assets if they are available locally.  If they are not available, the file shall be able to play without them.
?	Allow data to be in a shared windows folder to enable remote PCs to read from that point.

2.1.2 Playback of Recorded Files
?	The system should open a new window for playback of recorded files without interrupting the current recording or display of real time data.
?	The recorded files should attempt to use the same maps; assets associated with those maps, but NOT interrupt the ability of the first application to continue to display data coming in real-time. 
?	Support reading Trac-ID data off of the Internet via an Internet connected RX Base unit. 

2.1.3 Custom Map Support
?	Support custom maps that are installed into the application, and given coordinates. User must be able to choose from several maps stored with coordinates so they can ?switch? between them easily.
?	Support option to use the World File coordinate system. 
?	World files stored in the same directory as the maps, and named with the same name as the map name will result in automatic reading of map coordinates and map setup .
?	Easy to add a map to the application so it can be saved and re-used
?	Map image files and coordinate files will be stored in a folder known by the application
?	A coordinate text file may be stored in the folder with the same name as the map, containing the 4 coordinates for the map.
?	If a map and coordinate text file exists (World file or Coordinate), the user will not have to manually enter the coordinates into the map setup
?	If no coordinate file exists, the user may enter the coordinates for the 4 corners of the map in lat-long decimal format making the map usable
?	Google maps (moving) will be supported including zoom and automatic pan functions
?	Creation of new Map Features:  These Map Features will be  geo-located on the coordinate system, and include Zones, Points of Interest (POIs), and enable target destinations.
?	Creating a new zone will be accomplished by right clicking and drawing the zone until complete.
?	Zones may be named (50 char)
?	Zones may be exclusionary or inclusionary ? exclusionary zones will trigger if anyone comes from the outside in, inclusionary zones will trigger if anyone comes from the inside out.
?	Zones may be overlapped
?	Zones may have time-related triggers so they are active only during certain hours. i.e. Active only from 6pm-5am 
?	Any trigger event will be listed in an event window with time, Trac-ID, and zone triggered.
?	A trigger event may play a SOUND also (Set in preferences)
?	Zones may be set to a status of ?Quiet?, the result is no data from reporting Trac-IDs will appear on the map, or in the recorded data for Trac-IDs in Quiet Zones.  The Trac-IDs will be available for assignment in the admin function.
?	Once a Trac-ID leaves a Zone set as Quiet, it will report and record normally on screen and to the database.
?	Map Features (Zones and POIs) will appear in the ?Destination? list when assigning a person to a Trac-ID. 

2.1.4 Administrator User Enhancements:
?	Admin must log in to use the system using the Windows Logon Process
?	Admin will be registered to access GPS-Team, and logins must be tracked to record name and login time.
?	Add tab to allow user to define GROUPS of Trac-IDs such as ?Engineering?, ?Visitors?, ?Operations?, etc.
?	The ?Create Groups? function will be under ?Create Groups? tab ? under Tools-> Options menu, and extend the existing tab control.
?	Allow a user to create, edit, delete Groups, and assign an ICON
?	Add a view that shows all map assets such as Zones, Icons, POIs, and be able to list or delete.
?	Add an Icon library (folder) where Icons (JPG or GIF Image files) are stored for use by the program.  The application will ship with 10 Icons including car, tower, person, danger, plane, truck, boat, house, rocket, Square, and circle.  
?	The default Icon will be set in preferences. If the default Icon is not available, no icon will be displayed.
?	Admin will be able to easily select maps from a list of installed maps

2.1.5	Playback Improvements:
?	Select a Trac-ID file from a local text file or the DB
?	Play the Trac-ID back in a separate window when real-time data is being received on an active COM Port, or on any IP address.
?	Playback of Trac-ID file must continually record or display current ?real time data?
?	Allow user to browse to find specific files; i.e.  a file named "4_17_07" - meaning the day 4_17_07. When opened, the user shall be able to play it back from a time to a time via a dialog - play from 10:15:20 to 10:15:50.
?	Allow a second PC to view the same data as the first PC but NOT record. To play back, data base shall be utilized in a separate window.  Access to the data file will be managed by sharing the folder where the data is kep using Windows networking.
?	Select a recorded file and possibly one track from that file, and then export it to CSV, Trac-ID, or XML.  Extend current function of GPS-Team and enable creation of standalone file for particular Trac-IDs and times.  Such files will be stored locally as text files and named anything the user desires.

2.1.6	 Measure Distance:
?	Allow user to select a 'measure distance' setting from the right click menu on the map. 
?	Allow distance to be counted from point-point, and draw the line showing the distance being calculated. 
?	Show the total distance (pop-up window) in whatever units - default.

<CONTACT>Ms. Tracy M. Carole 301-227-4893
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) and the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC) are seeking information from potential sources that can provide commercially-viable technologies, systems, or processes for the recycling of shipboard plastic waste disks into feedstock for manufactured products or fuel in waste-to-energy conversions systems.  The Plastics Waste Processor (PWP) is used by the fleet to compact shipboard plastic waste into dense sanitary disks that can be stored in odor barrier bags to prevent shipboard habitability problems.  Navy ships retain the plastic waste disks onboard while at sea to comply with zero-plastic waste discharge regulations.  When ships return to U.S. ports, these disks are offloaded and disposed of in landfills.  Navy ships generate an estimated 1,500 tons per year of plastic waste. The goal of this initiative is to eliminate the landfill disposal of PWP plastic disks through recycling.  The potential obstacle to recycling is that the plastic disks intermingle various plastic types with food and other contaminants (e.g., metal, glass, paper, cardboard, and cloth) by melting the thermoplastics around the other constituents.  The proposed solution must demonstrate the ability to recycle the plastic waste disks into feedstock for manufactured products or fuel in waste-to-energy conversion systems at a cost equal to or lower than current landfill disposal fees ($40-$50 per ton).  The proposed solution shall also identify who will remove the plastic disks offloaded from Navy ships.  Potential offerors are requested to respond with technical documentation supporting the commercially-viable technology, system or process, including: (a) process description, (b) processing rate capability, (c) descriptions of demonstrations conducted to date, (d) current commerc!  ial, industrial, or military applications, (e) an estimate of the fee (per ton plastic waste) to process the PWP plastic disks, (f) preliminary implementation plan (less than one page), that tracks the Navy plastic disks from who removes the disks offloaded from Navy ships all the way to how the disks are used or consumed in the final application, and (g) quantity of systems sold or in use commercially.  Technical, industry, or professional society certifications or endorsements should be provided, if available.  The submittals should consist of no more than ten pages of text, including data and/or illustrations and are due by June 29, 2007.  This synopsis is for information purposes and to identify potential technologies and offerors.  This sources sought announcement does not constitute a request for proposal (RFP) and does not obligate the government in any way to purchase or test any of the potential solutions offered.  Furthermore, it does not commit the government to !  pay for any proposal costs in response to the sources sought announcem ent.  Submit responses for this synopsis to Ms. Tracy M. Carole by email (tracy.carole@navy.mil) or by mail to Naval Surface Warfare Center,  Attn: Tracy M. Carole, Code 634, 9500 MacArthur Blvd., West Bethesda, Maryland 20817-5700.

Requirement Specification is as follows: >From Hawkins, Air Force Research Laboratory public released paper.  (1) 1-Amino-3-methyl-1,2,3-triazolium iodide (C3H7N4I): 1-Amino-1,2,3-triazole 2.00 g (23.8 mmoles) was dissolved and stirred vigorously in 40 ml of acetonitrile at 20C, whereupon methyl iodide 22.92 g (161.9 mmoles) was added.  The reaction was stirred in darkness, being periodically monitored by thin layer chromatography until all amino-1,2,3-triazole was consumed.  As the reaction progressed, white crystals of 1-amino-3-methyl-1,2,3 triazolium iodide precipitated.  The product salt was collected by filtration and washed with several aliquots (50 ml total) of diethyl ether.  The mother liquor was concentrated by distillation under reduced pressure resulting in a second crop of crystals that were collected by filtration, washed with diethyl ether combined with first crop and dried under high vacuum, resulting in a good yield 4.99 g (93%) of 1-amino-3-methyl-1,2,3-triazolium iodide. (2) 1-Amino-1,2,3-triazole (C2H4N4) In a 500 ml round bottomed flask, equipped with an over-head stirrer 14.46 g (168 mmoles) of glyoxal bishydrazone were dispersed in 225 ml of acetonitrile at 20 C.  Manganese dioxide 30.00 g (348 mmoles), was added portion-wise over a few minutes to the vigorously stirred solution.  The reaction was stirred for 40 minutes whereupon additional manganese dioxide 20.00 g (232 mmoles) was added.  Thin layer chromatography revealed the reaction was complete 20 minutes later and it was filtered through a plug of Celite.  The filtrate was stripped down under reduced pressure leaving a viscous oil, that was sublimed yielding 12.30 g (88%) of highly pure 1-amino-1,2,3-triazole.  (3) Glyoxal Bishydrazone In a 2000 ml round bottomed flask, 510 g (15.94 moles) of anhydrous hydrazine were dissolved in 300 ml of methanol.  Amount of 725 g (5 moles) 40% glyoxal solution in water were added over a period of three hours while keeping the reaction mixture at 0-10 C and white solid precipitated.  After addition was completed, the flask was heated to about 80-90C until all the solids dissolved.  The flask was placed in the fridge over night and cold filtered.  The solids were washed on the filter with isopropanol and dried in a vacuum oven.  354 g (4.1 moles, 82%) glyoxal bishydrazone were collected.

<DESC>This synopsis is for Sources Sought, which may or may not result in a Solicitation and does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government to purchase or acquire systems or services.  The Government will not pay for data or time expended in response to this synopsis and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a request for proposal or award a contract as a result of this synopsis.  This synopsis is for Sources Sought and planning purposes.
The U. S. Department of Commerce (DoC), National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), is committed to preserving the stability and security of the Internet domain name and addressing system (DNS).  NTIA has ensured the stability and security of the DNS country code top-level domain for the United States (usTLD or .us domain) by supervising administration of the usTLD for the benefit of the nation?s Internet community.  Therefore, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, DoC intends to procure the services of a Contractor to manage, maintain, and operate the usTLD under NTIA?s supervision.  
The DoC seeks to acquire centralized management and coordination of registry, registrar (where specified), database, and information services for the usTLD. The usTLD provides a locus for registering domain names and serving the Internet community in the United States.  As such, DoC intends the usTLD be available to a wide range of registrants.  Accordingly, the DoC seeks proposals to achieve the following objectives:  1.) Ensure that procedures and an accountability framework for the delegation and the administration of the usTLD support a more robust, certain, and reliable DNS.  2.)  Promote increased use of the usTLD, including kids.us, by the Internet community of the United States (including small businesses, consumers, not-for-profit organizations, and state and local governments), with a residence or bona fide presence in the United States by introducing enhanced technical and other services, disseminating information about the usTLD, and improving registration and customer services.  3.)  Create a centrally administered and efficiently managed structure that ensures registrant and consumer confidence, and infrastructure stability by coordinating delegations and implementing other appropriate functions.  4.)  Create a stable and flexible usTLD environment that advances and encourages innovation and that will meet the future demands of potential registrants.  5.)  Ensure continued stability of the entire DNS and the usTLD, particularly during transition from the current management structure to the Contractor?s proposed structure and to any successor Contractor?s structure.  6.)  Manage the usTLD consistent with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers' (ICANN) technical management of the DNS.  7.)  Adequately protect intellectual property in the usTLD and as developments in the expanded and the locality usTLD space may necessitate. In the event of further expansion of the usTLD space, the Contractor shall implement a "sunrise period" for qualified trademark owners to pre-register their trademarks as domain names prior to the wider registration for non-trademark owners and a dispute resolution procedure to address "cybersquatting" conflicts between trademarks and domain names in the usTLD.  8.)  Establish and maintain consistent communication between the Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR), the Contractor, and ICANN.  The Contractor shall represent the usTLD in the ICANN Country Code Names Supporting Organization (ccNSO) and contribute to ICANN's operating costs as ICANN may apportion to the usTLD.   9.)  Promote robust competition within the usTLD, including registration services, to ensure greater choice and improved services for usTLD users.
All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis.   Additionally, the purpose of the above request is for the Government to determine the submitter's capabilities and qualifications to meet the requirement.   Affirmative responses must be received Friday, June 22, 2007 by 12:00 p.m. Noon Eastern Standard Time.   Please submit any and all written responses to Kalika Boulware, Contract Specialist via email to kalika.m.boulware@noaa.gov.

<DESC>The California Institute of Technologys Jet Propulsion Laboratory, operating under a prime contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), is seeking responses to this Request for Information (RFI) from Industry, academia, and other government agencies to collaborate in a teaming effort in support of Power Transmission Assessment Study for Lunar Surface Exploration Missions. BACKGROUND: NASA is planning a number of robotic and human missions for lunar surface exploration. One of the needs of some of these exploration missions is the transmission of power. REQUIREMENTS: The power levels range from a few watts to about 200kW, and distances range from a few meters to several tens of kilometers. The amount of power and the distances involved are not large by power engineering standards, but there may be some interesting technical challenges. For example, in space, cooling does not occur along the length of a wire, all the heat comes out at the ends. NASA has requested JPL to investigate the power delivery options. The power delivery system could be: (1) Wired or wireless: (2) AC or DC; (3) Overhead (no wind, so no tower footing problems); or possibly underground. The lunar dust (regolith) may be a problem as it is a good insulator and tends to get everywhere. What if the particles get charged? POWER ENGINEERING SOCIETY (PES) MEETING: If the potential party has an interest in a preliminary meeting to discuss ideas relating to lunar power delivery, wired or wireless, please contact Harold Kirkham, JPL Reliability Engineering Office at (818) 354-9699 or via email: harold.kirkham@jpl.nasa.gov to set up an appointment during the PES General Meeting on 06/24/2007 to 06/28/2007 held in Tampa, Florida. There is a possibility of a convening a workshop at JPL after the PES meeting. The date is to be determined. COMPANY CAPABILITIES: Prior to the PES General Meeting, please submit your expression of interest and your company capabilities statement, limited to one (1) page, including any applicable information relating to wired or wireless lunar power delivery no later than 06/15/2007. RESPONSES DUE: Submit the above requested information to maryhelen.ruiz@jpl.nasa.gov no later than 06/15/2007. TECHNICAL POINT OF CONTACT: Please direct questions and/or comments to Tsun-Yee Yan at (818) 354-3016 or via Email: yan@jpl.nasa.gov DISCLAIMER: It is emphasized that the requested information is for preliminary planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that JPL may solicit a procurement in the future. Neither JPL nor the Government will be responsible for any costs incurred by you in furnishing this information. Be advised that any information provided shall be deemed to be furnished with unlimited rights to JPL, with JPL assuming no liability for the disclosure, use, or reproduction of such data.

<DESC>The Southwestern Region of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is seeking information on the availability and capabilities of local small and other small business contractors who could provide supplemental assistance in handling mission requirements ass igned to the Corps of Engineers in support of disaster relief efforts that could result from hurricanes hitting along the Gulf Cost and coming inland during the 2007 hurricane season.  The Corps of Engineers has some pre-positioned contracts for such commo dities/services as ice, power generators, water, temporary roofing/housing, and debris removal.  However, this market research effort is sought to increase our awareness of, and opportunities for, local small and other small business resources that could a ssist in the event the existing emergency contract capacities/capabilities are exceeded, as well as to have a cadre of local small and other small business contractors who can respond to additional mission assignments in other relief areas.  It is envision ed that due to the timeframe needed to respond to the emergency situations, limited competitive procurement procedures will need to be utilized for actions not issued under existing emergency contracts.  Where opportunities for full and open competition ex ist, we will utilize that procurement process. Awards will be conducted in accordance with the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C., 5121 et seq.) and the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 26.2 Disaster or Em ergency Assistance Activities which provides preference to the extent feasible and practicable, to those organizations, firms, or individuals residing or doing business in the area affected by such major disasters or emergencies   As part of this process, we are seeking information about local small and other small businesses capable of providing the following services that could be required under a hurricane relief effort: (1) Temporary Roofing/Housing; (2) Debris Removal, (3) Dred ging, (4) Levee and Placement Area Repairs (5) Power Generation Support, (6) Quality Assurance personnel for assessing Roofing and Debris impacts as well as assisting during performance of recovery work.(7) water, sewer, and electrical hookup for mobile an d travel trailers, (8) Beach Restoration, (9) electrical work, and (10) sandbags. If interested, please register at http://www.swf.usace.army.mil/pubdata/hurricane/register.aspx   providing the specific information requested.  Failure to provide complete information will result in no further consideration of your firm.  Information from  other than local small or other small businesses will not be considered.     Please note that this is a market survey for informational purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  There is no solicitation document available; no contract will be awarded based on this announcement; no reimbursement will be made for costs  associated with responding to this announcement; and no telephone calls about this announcement will be accepted or acknowledged.  All responses must be submitted to the website at http://www.swf.usace.army.mil/pubdata/hurricane/register.aspx in accordanc e with the instructions above. Please Note that if you registered for previous hurricane relief you will need to reregister as the database has been cleared and a new county field has been added.

<DESC>1.  INTRODUCTION: a. This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the Department of Defense (DoD) is not seeking proposals, and will not be responsible for reimbursing cost incurred in response to this RFI.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested  partys expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP.  If a RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website at https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/.  It is the responsibility  of potential offerors to monitor this website, and any other pertinent website for additional information pertaining to this requirement. b. The request is for information only and will allow the Army to identify alternative technical approaches and develop an estimate of program cost and effectiveness.  As part of the first phase, the Army may conduct an information exchange meeting with re presentative companies under each of the alternatives cited in Paragraph 2, below.  It is anticipated that these meetings will take place in the July timeframe or earlier.  As stated in Paragraph a., this does not constitute a RFP.  Life cycle costing info rmation will strictly be used as an aid in ascertaining a Government estimate for these candidate representative solutions as a means to completion of the required Economic Analysis. 2.  PURPOSE:  The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to support the investigative case management system utilized by the DoD CITF. The government is looking for information in the following categories: (1) firms that have the resources (people an d facilities); (2) Commercial Off-the Shelf (COTS) or Government Off-the Shelf (GOTS) products capable of fulfilling the CITFs needs as they are determined; (3) a combination of categories (1) and (2); and (4) development of a personnel manning solution that would fulfill CITF sourcing needs within the stated timeframe. 3. BACKGROUND: The CITF has sole responsibility for conducting the investigation of alleged or suspected war crimes, acts of terrorism, and other related offenses committed by non-U.S. citizens against the United States or U.S. personnel.  The CITF provide s DoD a unique joint investigative capability tailored to the specific terrorist target and specifically designed to support the Global War. The CITF utilizes a centralized case management and investigation information automation system that provides a means of tracking and saving all collected investigative/intelligence information with reports being automatically populated and published; as w ell internal data mining tools for developing investigative leads This investigative information system structure allows for critical link analysis on the fly, which means an investigator/analyst will have all previous reports and incidents related to the subject at his or her finger tips during subsequent investigations. The main location of service will be at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. One position may be located at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, Cuba.  Travel outside the National Capital Region will be n eeded on an opportune basis and managed by exception. 4.  TIME FRAMES:  For planning purposes, this RFI is being conducted in support of an acquisition decision in the August 2007 timeframe.  5.  CAPABILITIES:  The functional responsibilities listed below provide the Investigative Case Management System requirements. Those responding to this request,  must categorize responses by identifying capabilities that currently exist, capabilities curre ntly under development, and capabilities that can be planned and scheduled.  For each of these three categories, responses are expected to address each subpar agraph below.  All responses must be accompanied by a plan addressing the approach, including a schedule, which describes the candidate technology and proposed approach for the CITF Investigative Case Management System, method of supply/delivery (e.g. full  delivery or spiral delivery with proposed approach to provide full capability), training, deployment, maintenance and sustainment.  Responses must also include information on licensing arrangements, if applicable, and an estimate of cost for the developme nt, training, deployment, maintenance and sustainment of the Investigative Case Management System. Responses are not to exceed the maximum equivalent of 20 pages, including schedules. Functional Requirements Overview The Contractor shall initially be able to provide no less than eighty percent immediately functionally qualified personnel to support all aspects of the CITFs investigative case management mission. An illustration of how the CITF employs its central over -arching case investigative information system follows. The over-arching case information management system is utilized to identify investigative leads and prepare prosecutorial material against enemy detainees awaiting trial by Military Commission.  It has been and continues to be the CITFs major informatio n technology (IT) tool in support of the war on terror. It performs critical investigative mission functions that are not duplicated by any other single information management system or group of management information systems that are collectively availabl e to the investigative special agents.  Because many of the specific CITF missions supported by this system are classified, an exhaustive list of critical missions supported by it is unavailable.   This case investigative management system assist CITF in examining, investigating and verifying potential participant object relationships to identify, track and investigate potential or suspected terrorists.  Participant object relationships, simply d escribed, represent the relationship of the individual detainee to his/her environment, including the detainees friends, family members, related institutions, sources of financing, and group (including terrorist group) affiliations.   The case investigative management system serves as the central point for gathering of information from a wide variety of sources, integrates that information, and presents this information to CITF agents in an easily comprehensible form.  It thus facilitat es and expedites agents recognition of potential significant object relationships and answer, for each detainee, such critical questions as:  Who is he?  Where has he been?  Who does he know?  Who knows him?  Where has he trained, schooled?  When did he t rain, who trained with him?  What is his travel history?  How does he support himself?   Detection of potential object relationships often requires review of a huge amount of data in which trends and commonalities are not readily apparent even to a skilled agent.  The case investigative management systems ability to process this data almost i nstantaneously allows CITF to quickly, effectively and efficiently identify investigative leads.  Further, once an initial investigation is completed, the case investigative system provides critical support to military or if required civilian justice opera tions and prosecution of war crimes.  The case investigative management system is capable of supporting the ultimate prosecution of an individual in any law enforcement arena whether it is military commissions, US or international court. The case management system contains all the investigativ e and intelligence information that is available to the prosecutors used in the conduct of the commissions in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It is the only information source accredited by the CITF and the Office of Military Commission (OMC). During the conduct of the commissions, all exhibits will be provided to the court and detai nee from this system.  The CITF case investigative management system is the repository of the case history of the detainee and as such represents the accumulation of evidence supporting the guilt (or innocence) of the detainee. It facilitates the developme nt of Reason to Believe (RTB) statements that are prepared to assist the President in making his decision whether or not to approve this detainee for trial.  Purpose The purpose of this document is to set forth the CITFs functional requirements and specifications for a web-based Investigative Case Management System. The remaining personnel must be fully capable within two month. General requirements and operational co ncepts are provided in the following subsections. General Description  This requirement document is written from the procurement and contracting perspective.

<SUBJECT>V--Ambulance Services
<DESC>Questions and answered submitted by a contractor. QUESTION:  We downloaded two forms from the federal business opportunities website in regards to this solicitation.  They are referenced as: VA-541-06-RP-0029 SCHEDULE B OCT 2.DOC  and VA-541-06-RP-0029 VA-541-06-RP-0029.DOC .  They appear very similar in nature.  Do we complete and submit each?  And, what forms are required of us for consideration? ANSWER:  Fill-in Schedule B in file VA-541-06-PR-0029 SCHEDULE B OCT2.DOC only.   QUESTION:  We are intending to submit a proposal for specific zones of coverage as opposed to all eight zones.  With that in mind and in regards to billable one way mileage only, begining on page nine (9) of form SF1449 and continuing for the descriptions of each zone the "Mileage Rate for Trips Extending Beyond the Geographic Zone" appears to be identified as an annual figure for ALS and BLS trips.  The same figure appears to be used in each subsequent zone description in regards to mileage.  Are these figures to be taken as actual/estimate mileage or as actual/estimated number of trips where the mileage extended beyond the geographical zone? ANSWER: Estimated mileage. QUESTION:  Begin on page nine (9) of form SF1449 and continuing for the descriptions of each zone the estimated number of trips appears to be identified as an annual quantity while in addendum I section B the number of estimated trips appears to be listed as a monthly quantity.  Which is correct? ANSWER:  The estimated trip figures are annual.&#160; The monthly "estimate" verbiage references estimated percentages for peak time and trips outside the geographic zone. Based on the estimated annual trips if a vendor wants to have an idea of what to expect regarding time and mileage they can figure this into their calculations. QUESTION:  We realize that the figures regarding the trip volume are not to be taken as a guaranteed number of trips. However is are there a set number of total trips for the base year, and each option year thereafter, which may limit the proposed or agreed upon price/reimbursement?  In other words, if the quantity of trips experienced by the contractor exceeds the estimated figure during any annual period; does the agreed upon per trip price  continue in affect for those trips above the projected volume or, is the cost of those trips in excess of the projected number to be absorbed by the contractor for the service? ANSWER:  The figures are only an estimate.&#160; Excess of the estimate is paid to the awarded vendor at the awarded price. QUESTION:  Our company provides many different service levels. These are ALS, BLS and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU).  While we are no currently a contractor with your agency the VA has utilized our MICU for trips your Cleveland facilities.  If we were the successful bidder for this particular solicitation which covers only ALS and BLS trips, would we be permitted to bill any future trips where the MICU was requested by VA staff for such transports at our usual rate?  Or, would the VA require another method to determine reimbursement? ANSWER:  Trips requested for MICU should continue to be billed as they are presently being billed as they are outside of the specifications of this contract. QUESTION:  Our company utilizes a comprehensive computerized record keeping system which begins with call intake/dispatching, encompasses field reporting/patient care reports by EMS personnel on mobile laptops and finalizes with software used to produce accurate billing.  On page 41 of form SF1449 the statement "Contractor shall not commingle the data from the system with information from other sources."   If awarded the contract it would be our intention to continue our current system.  This system allows for immediate access to records, insures accuracy and is an integral part of our quality assurance program. Our current system meets all HIPPA requirements and we have a strict policy covering security issues, dissemination and access of information.  Would we be permitted to continue this proven and established record keeping method? ANSWER:  It is acceptable to maintain your current system. &#160;The VA will require a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) is in place.  The BAA will specifically address the contractors use, disclosure and disposal of the information collected on our patients for the duration and termination of the contract.&#160; The contract will also specify what exact information shall be collected on the patients.&#160;&#160; QUESTION:  Our company maintains a standardized employment application process.  It includes the submission of fingerprints for criminal background checks of potential employees at the State and Federal levels.  It also involves the verification of all licenses, permits and certifications required for the position applied for. Any potential employee who fails to meet these requirements is not hired. Does documentation of the activities meet the VA standard as outlined on page 42 of form SF1449?  Or will we be required to utilize the services of the Office of Personnel Management for additional background checks? ANSWER:  The contractor will be responsible to have the "Office of Personnel Management" perform security background investigations.  The contractor will be responsible to comply with all requirements of the contract.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate,  as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 inch in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a se arched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Progra m, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or,  if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appro priate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.

Local clause 52.111-4132 state s:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only  be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access G ate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).   The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a volun tary program.  b.

If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the F AGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to th e contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) cale ndar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government  may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access id entification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to  both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or re production is discovered.  e.
