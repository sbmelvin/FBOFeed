<SUBJECT>60 -- NATO Notification of Intent to Invite Bids for International Competitive Bidding for Digital Short Range Line of Sight Communications Systems
<SOLNBR>IFB-CO-11873-LOS
<RESPDATE>021006
<ARCHDATE>02152006
<CONTACT>Lee Ann Carpenter, Trade and Industry Analyst, Phone 202-482-2583, Fax 202-482-5650, Email Lcarpent@bis.doc.gov - David Newsom, Trade & Industry Analyst - NATO Company Certification, Phone 202-482-7417, Fax 202-482-5650, Email dnewsom@bis.doc.gov
<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the procurement of Digital Line of Sight (DLOS) Communications Systems. Provision of these systems also includes delivery and installation of ACE Type 1 Shelters and Fiber Optic Modems (FOMs) and Fiber Optic interconnecting cables.  

The acquisition of Transmission Components for Non-Satcom Communications Systems, or Digital Line of Sight (DLOS) systems, entails the procurement of Short Range Line of Sight (SR LOS) systems, SR LOS Repeaters, FOMs and Fiber-Optic cables as well as various shelters and transport cases to house the equipment.

The scope of the competition is to elicit proposals from prospective bidders to supply and deliver the equipment and to provide the required services to NATO. The complete system will be operational by December 2007.

NC3A is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. NC3A intends to use the One Step/One Envelope ICB procedure. Bids submitted in response to this IFB are expected to have a minimum validity of nine (9) months.

NC3A plans to place a single contract with a single contractor. No partial bidding will be allowed. The resulting contract will require that the systems be delivered and operational no later than the 4th quarter of 2007.

The estimated value of this project is Euro 3.2 million (USD $3.9 million). The reference for this Invitation for International Bid (IFB) is IFB-CO-11873-LOS. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFB reference.  

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The bidding documents and prospective contract as well as all information the contractor is expected to handle during performance of the contract is expected to be NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Contractor personnel working at NATO sites during the installation of the DLOS Systems will be required to possess security clearances to a level of NATO SECRET.  

The purpose of this contract is to acquire transportable microwave communications systems in support of the NATO Deployable Communications and Information Systems (DCIS) for its Combined Joint Task Forces (CJTF).

SR LOS Systems and SR LOS Repeaters will be used to strengthen and extend the transport network in any deployed operation. Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) equipment will be sufficient to meet the requirement.

In particular the SR LOS equipment will be used to:

- Provide connectivity across a distance of maximum 30 km between deployed (or deployed and non-deployed) elements
- Minimize the dependency on the NATO satellite space segment
- Alleviate single points of failure in the communication networks

FOMs will be required to link headquarters and installations to the public network and to link the deployed CIS modules to tactical units and the CIS infrastructure of other organizations. FOMs provide high capacity/high quality links in a flexible way over long distances. The FOM should be able to provide 2 Mbps links (EI) over distances up to 4 km. COTS equipment will be sufficient to meet the requirement.

Fiber Optic cables to interconnect the FOMS will be required. The cables will use civilian quality connectors. For each pair of FOMs, 1 km fiber cable is required on drums of 250m.

Non-CIS items in this project are needed to cover all other items necessary to enable the SR LOS Systems to operate in a deployed field environment. This includes:

- Small shelter for all indoor equipment and for the end-user
- Standard rack for hosting all indoor equipment
- Power supplies
- Masts and coaxial cables for outdoor equipment
- Antennas
- Fiber-optic repair kits
- Test equipment (i.e., signal strength meters)
- Other items (i.e., wind speed meters, handcarts for cable drums)

Summary of Required Supplies and Services:

SR LOS Terminals (20) - Radio transceiver (1+0) with minimum 4*EI (8 Mbps) capacity using military frequency bands. Range up to 30 km. A system consists of one radio terminal with mast, coaxial cables, antenna and transportable case.

SR LOS Repeaters (20) - Radio transceiver (1+0) relay equipment with minimum 4*EI capacity (8Mbps) using military frequency bands. Range up to 30 km. A system consists of two radio terminals with masts, coaxial cables, antennas and transportable case.

Shelters (16) - ACE Type 1 Shelter (or similar). User Interface Enclosures to house the equipment and operator(s). Radio terminals and repeaters must have the capability to be installed in either transport cases (see category 1 and 2) or in shelters.

Fiber Optic Systems (10) - Two Fiber-Optic Modems with interconnecting Fiber-Optic Cables 

Bidders should be aware of the following NATO requirements:

In addition to the aforementioned systems, the bidder shall be required to propose network management terminals (laptops with management and configuration software loaded) to allow monitoring and configuration of the SR LOS Radios and Repeaters

Bidders are required to propose a fully integrated system, containing all elements of the project, namely SR LOS Systems, FOMs, cables and shelters and/or transport cases.

NC3A will require the contractor to perform a Proof of Concept Test (PoCT) before an order will be placed for the complete system.

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued. 
 
IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for the U.S. Department of Commerce to submit a Declaration of Eligibility on your behalf: 10 February 2006

2. Anticipated date that the Host Nation will forward the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) to those on the Bidders List: End of April 2006

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: July 2006

4. Anticipated contract award date: 4th Quarter 2006

<DESC>CONTACT Michael E. Harris, Senior Logistics Engineer, 732-532-2453. This is a broad, community-specific market survey to locate sources for supply of numerous avionics items that are currently in short supply within the Army and are needed immediatel y to support Army Aviation. In many cases, OEM suppliers are unable to produce sufficient quantities to meet our current needs. Thus, we are interested in buying assets from alternative sources. Depending upon specific circumstances for the items in questi on, we might be interested in buying new stock, new old stock, reconditioned items or, in some cases, unserviceable items. In some cases, this material may have been purchased by suppliers as surplus equipment. Depending upon respondents capabilities and the current status of our organic depot repair programs, we might be interested in having the supplier perform refurbishment/repair/overhaul. Alternatively, we might want to buy the unserviceable assets and induct these into ongoing organic repair programs  that are operating below capacity because of the longstanding paucity of unserviceable returns from the field. Regardless of specific circumstances, any company that possesses ANY significant quantity of Army avionics is encouraged to respond with informa tion regarding those assets that they have available. We have a list of key NSNs of interest that will be provided via e-mail upon request. Companies capable of performing this effort may respond by writing to: Commander, USA CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-CCS-N-AN  (MICHAEL E. HARRIS), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5403 or alternatively, contact us via e-mail at: EMAIL ADDRESS avionics@mail1.monmouth.army.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation(FAR)Subpart 13.5 -- Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (as supplemented with additional information included in this notice).

The proposed contract action is being solicited on a sole-source basis to Thermo Electron – Radiation Measurements and Protection, aka Thermo Eberline LLC, formerly Harshaw/Bicron NE/ Saint-Gobain Crystals & Detectors (SGCD).The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), this highly specialized maintenance is available only from the original source, Thermo Electron, and that award to any other source would result in (a) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition,and(b) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.

The TLD reader systems are proprietary equipment obtained from Thermo Electron. Award of this contract to a source other than that cited would significantly increase the cost of standardization and interchangeability, as the Naval Dosimetry Center system would require replacement as well.This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27 as well as DCN 20041512.

CAR-L01  NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (OCT 2003) (a) Past performance for this procurement will be evaluated using the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments !  (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to assist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!   for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or rev!  ised performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are  summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment!  , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requester’s name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data. To be eligible for award you must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.  Lack of registration in the CCR shall make an offeror INELIGIBLE FOR AWARD. Past performance will be evaluated using the Navy's RED/YELLOW/GREEN program as follows: (A) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System, Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) program. RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for the acquisition of commodities used to build and maintain the Fleet--materials, parts and components of ships, planes and weapons systems. (B) The Government reserves the right to award to the contractor whose offer represents the best overall purchase value to the Government. As such, the basis for contract award will include an evaluation of !  proposed contractor's quality performance history. The price to be considered in determining the best value will be the evaluated price after Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEA) or related quality assurance actions, as applicable, are applied to the offered price. (C) The procedures described in the clause of this solicitation entitled "ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTORS--CONTRACTOR EVALUATION SYSTEM, RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (MAY 1992)" will be used by the Contracting Officer to assist in determining the best purchase value for the Government - price, past quality performance and other factors considered.

<SUBJECT>A -- Collaborative Network for Clinical Research on Immune Tolerance
<SOLNBR>NIH-NIAID-DAIT-07-33

<ARCHDATE>02152006
<CONTACT>Deborah Blyveis, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-7211, Fax 301-480-4675, Email blyveisd@niaid.nih.gov - Erin Goldstein, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-496-6423, Fax 301-402-0972, Email EG108r@nih.gov
<DESC>The NIAID supports a broad range of basic, translational, and clinical research on the underlying mechanisms of immune tolerance, and the evaluation of tolerance induction strategies in animal models and in clinical trials.  Tolerance induction strategies aim to selectively block or prevent deleterious immune responses, while leaving protective immunity intact.  The successful induction of immune tolerance to treat and prevent immune-mediated disorders is a major goal of these efforts.  Advances in tolerance induction will provide valuable new therapeutic strategies that will not require life-long, systemic immunosuppressive therapy with its deleterious side effects.  For example, in transplantation, donor-specific immune tolerance - a selective blockade of immune responses directed against the graft - would enable long-term graft survival without the complications and risks of systemic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., infection, malignancy, and atherosclerosis).  In asthma and allergic diseases, the goal of tolerance research is to develop methods to prevent immune responses to allergens, such as cockroach and house dust mite, that cause or exacerbate these diseases.  In autoimmune diseases, researchers are developing novel approaches to block the immune responses that cause the body to mistakenly attack its own organs, tissues, or cells. 
The purpose of this solicitation is to recompete the “Collaborative Network for Clinical Research on Immune Tolerance,” first awarded in 1999, and to expand the required work to include nonclinical research and product development, bioinformatics, and data collection, validation, and analysis.  One award is expected to be made in response to this solicitation.  The NIAID recognizes that no single organization or institution may have the expertise and facilities required to perform all requirements set forth in the Statement of Work; consequently, the Contractor may need to utilize the expertise and services of subcontractors to perform the tasks required.  The Contractor shall be responsible for all work performed under this contract, including that performed by subcontractors.

The scope of work to be performed by the Network includes:

•	The design and conduct of Phase I-IV clinical trials of  investigational approaches intended to lead to a functional state of immune tolerance;

•	The design and conduct of mechanistic studies and the development of tolerance assays as integral components of these clinical trials; 

•	Focused product development and nonclinical studies (e.g., toxicology, pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics, etc.) essential for the subsequent evaluation of experimental tolerance induction therapies in humans; and

•	The provision of bioinformatics, data management and analysis resources.  

In addition to the tasks outlined above to be provided for in the basic requirement,  Options may be exercised, at the discretion of the Government, for additional tasks including:

•	Nonclinical research and product development
•	Clinical trials
•	Mechanistic studies
•	Bioinformatics support

The Network will require strong leadership to provide for the overall scientific direction, coordination and management of complex research studies involving a large number of geographically distributed facilities, subcontractors, and Network personnel.  The Network will also establish collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, other NIH sponsored clinical research programs, and private research organizations to identify and evaluate tolerance induction therapies, conduct mechanistic studies, and perform assays to assess the induction, maintenance, and loss of tolerance.

It is anticipated that one seven year cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded, beginning approximately February 1, 2007.  

Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.  RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-07-33 will be available electronically on or about January 30, 2006 with a closing date tentatively set for June 5, 2006.   The RFP may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps web site located at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ . 

This notice is for information and planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.   This is not a request for proposals.  The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses under this announcement.   No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Procurement Management Division (PMD) intends to issue a request for proposal (RFP) to obtain the services of a contractor to perform all work necessary to conduct the Private Employer Information Report (EEO-1) Survey.  The Employer Information Report (EEO-1) survey is a compliance survey required by Federal law and regulation. The survey is conducted annually.  It is authorized by Section 709(c) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and accompanying EEOC regulations.  The following tasks will be performed under the contract: (1) Collect employment data by: race/ethnic categories, by nine broad occupational categories, by gender, and by contractor and non-contractor status annually, from 45,000-50,000 employers. These employers submit approximately 230,000 EEO-1 forms or computer printouts, which must be entered into the data base; (2) Prepare Preliminary Mail File and Mail Printed Survey documents;(3) Update or develop a web site on-line filing system; (4) Perform keying, editing, coding and data entry verification of all data from the EEO-1 Survey and (5) develop statistical and other required data files from data collected. Currently, the EEO-1 survey consists of two distinct methods of processing.  The first is the old customary survey processing which involves handling of paper survey forms several times during mail out, receipt, manual editing and data entry (Approximately 20 percent of the survey falls into this category).  Approximately 80 percent of the employers submit their data online.  Both of these methods run concurrently and the deadline and all other critical dates are the same for both.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Eddy Purwanto, Deputy for Housing, Infrastructure and Land, Badan Rehabilitasi dan Rekonstruksi NAD-Nias (BRR), Jl. Ir. H. Muhammad Thaher No. 20, Lueng Bata, Banda Aceh, Indonesia 23247, Phone: (62) 0651-636666, Fax:(62) 0651-637777.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability for Technical Assistance for the Aceh Intermodal Transport Strategy project.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) is providing funding for Technical Assistance for the development of a medium-to-long-term intermodal transportation strategy for Indonesia’s Aceh Province.  Development of such a strategy will enable the government of Indonesia to more effectively plan its future investments, as well as help U.S. companies gain an insight into the types and locations of upcoming projects.

This activity will include providing a medium-to-long-term strategy to maximize the efficiency of the overall transportation sector, addressing not only the road network but also ports, railways and the aviation sector.  This Technical Assistance will also identify projects that would reduce the vulnerability of Aceh’s transportation network to future disasters.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $444,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.  A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA-financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM on 24 February 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO LIMIT COMPETITION 
DESCRIPTION:  On July 1, 2005, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Pittsburgh Research Laboratory, Disaster Prevention Response Branch announced its intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with Foundation Coal Company's Emerald Coal Resources LP for the drilling of three experimental reservoir monitoring boreholes from the surface above longwall panel B3 prior to undermining.  Originally our intent was to make the award to Foundation Coal for the entire project.  The purpose of the cooperative effort was to obtain specific reservoir, geomechanical and lithological data for ongoing numerical modeling efforts which are designed to predict methane emissions into the underground environment. Due to re-negotiation, NIOSH will now be issuing the announcement and subsequent orders for the work. This announcement is for Phase 2 only; site preparation/reclamation and drilling and completion of the boreholes.   

BACKGROUND

As part of its mine safety research program, NIOSH’s Pittsburgh Research Laboratory has initiated a reservoir modeling effort to better understand the interaction of the various geotechnical factors influencing methane flows within the underground longwall mining environment.  Numerical models can offer the coal mining industry versatile evaluations of methane emission problems and answer specific questions related to the optimization of methane control systems, without exposing the work force to potentially hazardous methane concentrations.  Development of a comprehensive methane emission model for the underground mining environment is complex and requires a significant amount of site-specific geotechnical and reservoir data to achieve reliable predictions of methane movement and emission.  During the last 10 years of NIOSH methane control research collaboration with Foundation Coal formerly RAG, Inc.) in, an extensive geotechnical and reservoir characterization database was created.  The proposed borehole monitoring experiment is part of a numerical modeling initiative to develop ways to better control methane to enhanced underground workplace safety. Therefore, the proposed study is critical for enabling NIOSH researchers to obtain critical reservoir parameters for the model development research that cannot be obtained otherwise. These data will help them to further improve their modeling techniques and the predictive capabilities of the final products which will ultimately be widely applicable, once the research model is sufficiently developed.  Performing this experiment on Foundation Coal’s property is essential for making this research a continuation of previous field and modeling studies.  	

Under a negotiated Memorandum of Understanding, Foundation Coal is placing a restriction on NIOSH for the drilling work and limiting competition to their current vendors lists.  Because we will be drilling over their underground coal operations, the risks and safety concerns of having unfamiliar drilling operators has been determined to not be in their best interests.  

Based on our agreement with Foundation Coal, the competition for this drilling project will be limited to a list of potential vendors supplied to us by Foundation Coal.  This notice is issued for information purposes only.   This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 12, Commercial Procedures. If any firms do present capabilities information in response to this notice, there is no guarantee that they will receive the solicitation.

THE POINT OF CONTACT IS MARGARET MOONEY, REFERENCE: #MGW-2006-5, DHHS, PHS, CDC, NIOSH, 626 Cochran’s Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA, e-mail ZIA3@CDC.GOV, or 412/386-6431.  Brenda Goodwin, the point of contract listed below will not be available so, please do not contact Morgantown.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is based on justification of limited competition and consideration of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   The Government intends to request quotes without further notices being issued on or after February 6, 2006. All information received will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando, TSD intends to contract on a sole-source basis with Northrop Grumman, in support of Technical expertise in conducting an architectural and capabilities analysis for the Generic PC-based Reconfigurable Training System (GRTS). A sole source award is contemplated because Northrop Grumman Information Technology’s COTS CTTASã is the underlying architect of the GRTS system and as such would be the only contractor that could provide the technical support needed to conduct the study of architectural and capabilities analysis for the Generic PC-based Reconfigurable Training System (GRTS) to provide a Total Ship Training Synthetic Environment for the LCS class, and the LCS core and mission packages training applications. 

The Navy is developing a new class of combatant called Littoral Combat Ship (LCS).  This concept provides a Sea Frame and Multiple Mission Packages.  Mission Packages and Sea Frames will be deployed forward and crews will rotate based on time-on-station and mission.  Both the Sea Frames and the Mission Packages are being developed using a spiral development approach.  LCS Core and Mission Package Training is both a near and long tear challenge.  Current industry teams are developing the Sea Frames while Navy Laboratories and other industries develop the Baseline Zero Mission Package for Mined Warfare (MIW) and Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW).  As stated above the concept is for crews to rotate every 90 days.  Developing and maintaining tactical proficiency for multiple crews staged in Fleet concentration areas presents a significant challenge.

The Navy needs a Total Ship Training capability that can be used to develop and maintain crew proficiency for LCS combat operations.  This training system needs to be ready to begin use no later than December 2006.  NAVAIR Orlando TSD intends for the contractor to conduct an architectural and capabilities analysis for the Generic PC-based Reconfigurable Training System (GRTS) Architecture to provide a Total Ship Training Synthetic Environment for the LCS class, and the LCS core and mission packages training applications.  The purpose of this task is to have the contractor provide technical support to the Government in the development of a “30 day quick study” analysis of possible shore-based training system solutions for the LCS core and mission system training. Architecture is to provide a Total Ship Training Synthetic Environment for the LCS class, and the LCS core and mission packages training applications. The immediate requirement is to have a contractor provide technical support to the Government in the development of a “30 day quick study” analysis of possible shore-based training system solutions for the LCS core and mission system training. 

The CTTASã is a commercial COTS product that provides simulation framework for developing both training systems and warfare/system analysis test beds.  CTTASã is an open architecture set of software components that runs on standard PC hardware linked on standard networks.  The CTTASã framework features standard application programming interfaces (API) for Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) and High Level Architecture (HLA) as well as well-defined APIs for display and system interfaces.  As the architect for this simulation framework, which comprises the GRTS architecture, it is imperative that Northrop Grumman Information Technology provides the technical support necessary to complete this “30 day quick study” analysis.

This sole source award is based on substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to recover through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the customer’s needs. Interested firms may submit their capabilities and qualifications to the identified point of contact not later than Closing time of this notice. Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. This is not a request for quotes, and this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. 

If you have any questions or concerns please contact: Mr. Mark A. Muñiz, Contract Specialist, phone 407-380-4080, fax 407-380-4164, or Mark.Muniz@Navy.Mil

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Modification to BAA04-17 - Innovative Information Exploitation Technology and Systems.  The purpose of this modification is to announce a Briefing to Industry (BTI) and invitation for proposals for research being conducted under BAA04-17, Section A.1.10 "Urban Warfare Technology".  The program which is specifically the subject of this modification is "Security and Patrolling Enablers Yielding Effective SASO" (SPEYES).  It is the goal of the SPEYES program to develop and demonstrate an innovative force-multiplying multi-echelon C3I system to enhance military effectiveness for SASO missions. The SPEYES system is envisioned as an integrated suite of Sensing, Situation Awareness, Command and Control, and Shaping technologies tailored for decentralized small unit Army operations. Specifially, the goal of the SPEYES program in 2005 is to achieve a four-fold force-multiplying improvement in three daily-occurring and manpower-intensive SASO missions: Fixed Site Security, Daily Patrols, and Cordon and Search.  Additional details regarding the SPEYES research goals will be provided at the BTI.  The BTI is scheduled for 8 December 2004 and will be held at Schafer Corporation, 3811 North Fairfax Drive, Suite 400, Arlington VA.  Information on the SPEYES BTI may be found at: http://www.schafertmd.com/speyes_bti/. Pre-registration for the SPEYES BTI is mandatory, as seating is limited to a maximum of 40 people. Due to this limitation, ONLY TWO people from the same proposing company, agency or institution will be allowed to attend. The deadline for pre-registration is 7 December 2004 at 12:00 (noon) EST.  All information presented at the BTI will be made available for download at http://www.darpa.mil/IXO/Solicitations/IXO/index.htm, including a FAQ that will be generated based on the BTI presentation. Offerors are invited to submit proposals against this research topic based on the BTI presentation/material and in accordance with the directions currently delineated in the BAA04-17 Proposer Information Package (PIP).  As currently stated in the BAA04-17 PIP, DARPA employs a mandatory electronic upload process for proposal submissions. Proposers may find submission guidance at: http://dtsn.darpa.mil/IXO/solicitations/ixo/index.htm. Organizations must register at: http://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa to propose. One registration per proposal should be submitted. Organizations wishing to submit multiple proposals should complete a single registration for each proposal. The deadline for proposal registration is 22 December 2004 at the URL listed above. Proposal submissions are due no later that 29 December 2004 at 12:00 (noon) EST. By registering, the Proposer has made no commitment to submit a proposal. Proposal submissions must be unclassified; however, proposers must be prepared to handle classified materials in the event an award is given.  Original Point of Contact: Michael Blackstone, Contracting Officer, Phone (517) 218-4804, Fax (703) 807-4940, email mblackstone@darpa.mil.

The construction portion of the project is estimated to begin April  2006. 


A qualified contractor will be selected using a Two-step, No-go “Low Price Technically Acceptable” (LPTA) source selection procedure, in accordance with Part 15 of the FAR.  Moreover, this will be a lump sum, fixed-price contract not set aside for small businesses. During step one of the Two-step LPTA, offers will be evaluated against the Go/No-go qualification factors.  Proposals found to be acceptable will then move on to step two of the evaluation process, during which price proposals will be opened and evaluated.  It is the Government’s intention to award the project to the lowest-priced bidder.  The bidder must also meet the Government’s standards of responsiveness and responsibility.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct negotiations if it is in its best interest to do so.

All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitations. The contractor will be required to correct all deficiencies identified by the Government (or in its own quality control review) relating to the completeness or accuracy of the work, compliance with the contract, and compliance with any applicable laws or regulations.  The services procured under this contract will conform to the quality requirements in the specification.  Any Government furnished information relating to this acquisition will be distributed to parties after an award.  After an award, quality control will also include inspection, acceptance, warranty and other measures associated with quality requirements.  The contractor is not required to provide data or service for any of the systems that will be installed during this project.  Only typical inspection, training, acceptance, warranty and other requirements normally associated with our standard construction contracts will apply.  

Small Business Participation: This is a procurement open to both large and small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220 with a small business size standard of $28.5 million. Although this procurement is not set aside for small businesses, small firms including women-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, and service disabled veteran-owned business are strongly encouraged to participate in this project. In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract. Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA). An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract. Small businesses are not subject to this requirement. However, all firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local business participation. Contractors will submit a written narrative (limited to one typed written page) along with their offers that outlines their outreach efforts made to utilize local firms. In order to receive the benefit of a price evaluation preference as a HUBZone small business concern, firms must be certified by the SBA.

Joint Ventures: Joint ventures or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality CMc team effort.

The  U.S. Army Engineer District-Japan is planning to solicit a MATOC for D-B-B and D-B construction to support U.S. Government  facilities in Mainland Japan (excluding Hokkaido) and a separate MATOC for the same services in Okinawa.  Any solicitations  pursued are intended for local sources only.  Local sources are those sources normally resident and licensed to conduct  business in Japan.  A MATOC is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract for construction sevices with multiple  awardees.  Actual work is awarded through the issuance of task orders.  Mulitple awardees generally compete with each other  for task orders.  There are some exceptions to this rule, whereby competition may be reduced or task orders are issued  non-competitively to one contract holder.  The Government anticipates award of up to three contracts under each MATOC to  experienced sources capable of performing a wide range of D-B-B and D-B construction projects including, but not limited to:   grading, water lines, sewer lines, paving/repaving roadways, painting, roofing, renovation of interiors of existing  buildings, new building construction, structural construction, Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and  components, refrigiration systems, fire suppression systems, fuel pipeline and storage systems, power and services supplies,  distribution and utilization systems (including lighting), power generators and Uninterrupted Power Supplies (UPS), public  address systems, fire alarm systems, telephone systems, asbestos, lead based paint, and petroleum-contaminated material  abatement and disposal.  Each MATOC will consist of a one-year base period and two (2) one-year option periods.  The total  maximum amount the Government will order under all three contracts combined is the not-to-exceed- amount of 575,000,000  Japanese YEN per period.  The guaranteed minimum amount for each contract s base period and each option period exercised is  575,000 Japanese YEN.  The Government intends to award both MATOCs based on Price and Non-Price evaluation factors.   Non-Price factors are of equal weight to each other.  Non-price factors combined are significantly more important than price.   Non-price factors are:  Management Plan, Past Relevant Experience (D-B-B and Design only, or D-B), and Past Performance  (D-B-B and Design only, or D-B).  Price proposals will be evaluated based on contractor s home office and field office  overhead rates that will be applied to each task order throughout the life of the contracts.  In addition, key personnel work  day rates for Program Manager, Contractor Quality Control System Manager, Project Superintendent, Design Quality Control  Specialist, Site Safety and Health Officer and Interpreter will be evaluated and applied throughout the life of the  contracts.  A performance bond will be required for individual task order that is over the Japanese YEN equivalent of  $100,000.  Therefore, the Government intends to require contractors to demonstrate bonding capacity of 1,150,000,000 Japanese  YEN.  The minimum task order amount is 2,875,000 Japanese YEN.  The maximum task order amount is 575,000,000 Japanese YEN.   Task orders issued under these contracts will be D-B-B or D-N in nature.  For D-B-B task orders, the Government will provide  the contractor with full design.  For D-B task orders, contractor may be required to produce engineering designs ranging from  shop-drawings to full designs in accordance with Unified Facilities Guide Spec ifications (UFGS) depending on the complexity  of the task order.  The Government will provide the contractor with a project scope varying from a general scope of work with  no drawings to a complete statement of work with design up to 90 percent.  Contractor designs will be conducted after award  of a task order in accordance with both U.S. and Japanese design standards.  The contractor will be required to provide  licensed professional designers having qualifications that meet contract requirements.  QUALIFICATIONS OF DESIGNERS (Excerpt  from Section 01012, Design After Award):  All design professionals shall have current registration to practice in the United  States or Japan; however, there may be particular task orders involving Fire Protection design and specifically requiring  U.S. Professional Registration.

<DESC>Solicitation SB1341-06-Q-0116 is hereby amended to address vendor questions/answers.

Question: In the Statement of Work, Background, it says "All interior positive pressure exhaust ducts shall be leak tested."  In the Scope of Work it says "inspect the condition of ductwork for leaks". In neither case there is not mention of a procedure or reference a standard to be applied for this work. Is the intent for a visual/audible inspection of the ductwork for leakage or is there a procedure and criteria for performing leakage testing of the ductwork that will be provided? 

Answer: At this time only a visual / audible inspection of the entire system including the positive duct will be necessary. A more in depth inspection of the systems will be done in another phase of this work at a later date. The Contractor however, (at his discretion) may introduce a small amount of smoke or a specific odor (such as peppermint) to the system to aid in this inspection.

The current response date remains unchanged. All responses shall be submitted not later than 3:30pm, local time on January 20, 2006.

Detailed questions on format and minor  issues are not the purpose of the VID. Questions that address omissions  and significant issues or areas of confusion are desired.

Note: New buyer Theresa  Hay replaces Michelle Hendricks on all future correspondence. ************************************************************************ Update 30 Sep 2005 - Re-Send to Fed Biz Opps - Organizational Conflict of  Interest The Fed Business Opportunities site can not handle the  Description in excess of 24000 characters so the original Sources Sought  announcement of 17 May has been saved as a WORD file and loaded to the  XR-SIMAF PIXS library below as  "ORIGINAL_SOURCES_SOUGHT_ANNOUNCEMENT_17MAY05". NOTE: The CO Finding  letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and the re-drafted OCI clause for  XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below.  ************************************************************************  Update 29 Sep 2005 - Organizational Conflict of Interest The Contracting  Officer has found that the potential for OCI is a significant concern for  successful performance of the XR-SIMAF Capabilities Integration Services  contract(s) and therefore the OCI clause has been re-drafted to reflect  this concern. OCI Mitigation Plan Acceptability Criteria will address the  OCI issue in the draft Request for Proposal (dRFP) and any resulting  contract(s). Further, in source selection the potential for OCI will be  considered in the determination of which proposal offers the best value to  the Government. The CO Finding letter to industry dated 29 Sept 2005 and  the re-drafted OCI clause for XR-SIMAF are loaded to the library below. *********************************************************************** Update 16 Sep 2005 - Small Business Size Standard Update The upcoming  competition for the XR-SIMAF services acquisition will require offerors to  submit robust small business subcontracting goals for services that  involve a high level of complex skill sets. The NAICS code of 541710  remains the same however the size standard for small businesses in this  acquisition (briefed on 14 June 2005 at Industry Days) has been raised to  1,000 employees. The original FBO/PIXS announcement indicated $10,000,000  however the Industry day briefing indicated a size standard of 500  employees. The Contracting Officer has determined that a size standard of  500 could overly restrict Large Businesses who must assemble a robust  subcontracting plan by limiting the pool of qualified small businesses  that could provide support for this acquisition and artificially reduce  subcontracting goals. Thus, in an effort to broaden the desired small  business base for this acquisition and facilitate stronger small business  participation, the size standard for small businesses in this acquisition  has been raised to 1,000 employees. This determination has been  coordinated and approved by the ASC Small Business and the Small Business  Administration offices. ********************************************************************** Update 18 Aug 2005 – Initial Acquisition Strategy + Delay in dRFP Release  Assessment of the submitted Statements of Capability (SOC) was completed  on 8 July 2005. The XR-SIMAF overall acquisition strategy was presented at  the Acquisition Strategy Panel on 22 Jul 2005 and approved. It was  determined that this XR-SIMAF acquisition will not be a Small Business  (SB)Set-Aside. The SB strategy under consideration will require offers to  provide aggressive small business subcontracting participation in any  proposal. Pending final approval of the detailed strategy in the  Acquisition Plan, we will consider up to two awards for consolidated  Function Areas A, B, C and E under a prime contractor(s) (based on a Best  Value Source Selection decision). Area D may be made as a stand alone  award or combined with an A-B-C-E award. Organizational Conflict of  Interest (OCI) is still a significant issue that will be addressed in a  tailored clause AFMC 5352.209-9002, which should be posted to PIXS in the  next two weeks. The anticipated release of the dRFP is sliding by 45 days  to late Sept 2005. Industry will have 30 days to comment on the draft RFP.  Release of the formal RFP may slide by 45 days until late November 05 with  proposals due early Jan 06. Award is contemplated late April 06. A new  attachment (Schedule_18_Aug_05.ppt) has been added showing the projected  schedule for this effort.  ********************************************************************** Update 8 July 2005: Third set of Industry Day questions and answers has  been added to the library (scroll below). Questions were received during  one on one interview sessions June 15, 2005.  ********************************************************************* Update: Second set of answers to questions and Industry Day POCs - 24 June  2005 Questions were received prior to Industry Day regarding CMMI and  current contractors working in SIMAF. A request was also received for  contact information of companies participating in Industry Days. Both have  been added to the library (scroll below). We are working on questions  received during Industry Day and anticipate posting answers by 6 July  2005.  ************************************************************* Update: Upload of Industry Day Files - 15 Jun 05 Files briefed at the 14  Jun 05 Industry Day have been uploaded to the PIXS library. ********************************************************* Update: Extension of SOC Submittal Date + Industry Day briefings - 14 Jun  05 During the Industry Day held today, it was determined that the  submittal of the Statement of Capability (SOC), originally due on Friday  June 17th will be extended to 1600 (EST) Wed June 22nd. Several Questions  were asked about the SOC and the SOC format. For clarity the following  infromation is provided: Format and Structure for a SOC Covering Multiple  Functions QUESTION: Because the standard business practices, company past  performance and responses to the OCI, ACA and ITAR  requirements/restrictions will be the same for all functional areas, would  it be acceptable for the offeror to submit a cover letter with separate  attachments; one containing the common company data and then attachments  that address each functional area separately? ANSWER: Yes, if a firm is  providing a SOC for multiple functions the functions being proposed may be  grouped together under one cover page and submitted as a package. Common  or repeated information may be referred to from another function area SOC,  however stand-alone SOCs are preferred. One or two cross- references will  be acceptable, however. Cover Page - Firms are allowed to submit a one  page cover page that may contain business information and details like  business size and CAGE code, etc. The cover page does not count towards  the 5 pages per function. Submittal of SOC via e-mail QUESTION: Will it be  acceptable to submit the SOC via email? ANSWER: Yes, e-mail submittal is  acceptable. Please allow up to an hour for e- mail delivery incase of low  band-width at WPAFB. Submit all electronic SOC submittals to Patricia  Krabacher, patricia.krabacher@wpafb.af.mil. The PCO will confirm receipt  of the SOC. Availability of Industry Day Briefings QUESTION: Will the 14  June 05 XR-SIMAF Industry Day briefings be made available to industry via  PIXS, or via a CD and when?

<CONTACT>Leo F. Pelletier Jr.  Contracting Officer 9283438138     lpelletier@lc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>The Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office, is conducting a Sources Sought for information purposes only.  This is not a solicitation announcement and this notice does not constitute any commitment by the Government. The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources.  Responses to this Sources Sought Synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. The Yuma Area Office has a future requirement for the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of Yuma Desalting Plant (YDP); The Water Quality Improvement Center (WQIC) research facility; and  The Analytical Laboratory Service (ALS) located at 7301 Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, Arizona.   The government anticipates that multiple awards may be made.  The selected contractor must exhibit appropriate and relative reverse osmosis (RO) desalting experience to include (1) Administration; (2) Operations; (3) Maintenance; and (4) Engineering support, to satisfy the mission requirements as identified in the draft Statement of Work. The YDP is one of the world's largest reverse osmosis desalting plants.  Its full capacity is 72 million gallons per day.  Though the main plant is not currently operating, it is maintained.  The contractor will be required to provide all contract management, planning, supervision, administration, personnel, operation, engineering support, labor, tools, equipment, supplies, materials, chemicals, services, transportation, and facilities necessary to perform all aspects of the contract requirement.  Extensive Government Furnished Equipment, Materials, Property, and Tools will be provided as well as procurement for the same when the value exceeds allowable costs. The WQIC is a designated National Center for Water Treatment Technology, a nation-wide affiliation of publicly-funded water-research facilities that partner with the public for testing. The National Water Research Institute, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, and the U.S. Army sponsor the National Centers Program. The goal of the National Centers Program is to promote improved water-treatment processes through united research efforts by government, academia, and private industry. There are currently only seven National Centers in the U.S., and each center explores different water research focus areas.  The Analytical Laboratory supports the YDP, WQIC and other Government authorized operations by performing chemical, biological, and physical tests; and preparing the data for engineering and data reporting. The mission of the WQIC is to advance the development and transfer of water purification technologies at its state-of-the-art facility through field tests, hands-on training, and implementation. The varying levels of research focus on the following research goals: (1) analytical laboratory services for YDP and the YAO; (2) to reduce the cost to operate and maintain the YDP; (3) securing safe, clean water supplies for the West now and in the future; and (4) transferring federally-developed technology to the public pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986. Comments and information on the following are requested:  (1) company name, address, point of contact and their telephone number and e-mail address; (2) Approximate annual gross  revenue; (3) Any small business status (8(a), HUBZone, veteran-owned, women-owned, etc.); (4) Indicate the magnitude of previous similar contracts and references thereto including point of contact name, telephone and/or e-mail address.  Request response be provided no later than January 25, 2006.   The proposed action is a primarily a Cost Plus Award Fee contract, with Cost Reimbursable, Fixed Fee, and Job/Work Order Line Items included for a highbred combination award  O&M Contract (full details will be contained in the solicitation).  The performance period will have a base performance of 1 year, and four 1 year options.  The Government is responsible for determining the contractor's level of responsibility for each contract year.  The Government, at its option and with notice, may increase or decrease the level of responsibility to achieve a desired level of support in accordance with the SOW, through award of appropriate Line Items. Interested parties may request a copy of the proposed draft scope of work to Ms. Virginia Toledo at vtoledo@lc.usbr.gov.  Only electronic requests will be accepted.  No telephone or hard copy request.

<DESC>Innovative Information Exploitation Technology and Systems, SOL BAA 04-17, Abstracts Due: 9 April 2004, Proposals Due: 18 June 2004; POC: Dr. Robert Tenney, Deputy Director, DARPA/IXO; Phone (703) 696-2298.  BACKGROUND:  DARPA's Information Exploitation Office (DARPA/IXO) is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development of enabling technology, critical subsystems, and full system concepts that will provide revolutionary improvement to the efficiency and effectiveness of military command, control, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (C2ISR) and strike operations in complex battlespaces.  The goal of this solicitation is to identify and develop novel ideas about sensing, signal processing, target characterization, data fusion, target tracking, predictive awareness, battle management, collaborative planning, and visualization that can contribute to future warfighting effectiveness.  Ideas can address 1) ways to employ new scientific/technical developments to achieve significant increases in component performance; 2) novel combinations of existing technologies into systems that create new warfighting capabilities; or 3) combinations of both.  Proposed efforts should constitute at least two phases. The first phase should seek to establish the technical feasibility of the concept, in an exploratory effort lasting between 3 months and one year. Phases beyond the first should be proposed as options leading toward increasingly robust technology or system development, and consist of 12-18 month segments with specific capability goals to be achieved at the end of each segment.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES/DESCRIPTION:  The DARPA Information Exploitation Office develops sensors and information processing systems with application to battle space awareness, targeting, command and control, and the supporting information infrastructure required to address surface threats across the full range of anticipated warfighting environments.  IXO focuses on automating and accelerating the processes by which U.S. forces perform surface target interdiction in environments that require very high combat identification confidence and an associated low likelihood for inadvertent collateral damage.  Proposals that address any aspect or combination of aspects that fall within IXO’s broad mission objectives may be submitted under this BAA.  TECHNICAL TOPIC AREAS:  Areas of specific interest include but are not limited to: 1) Sensors, 2) Exploitation, 3) Positive, Combat Identification,  4) Battlespace Visualization, 5) Network-Centric Battle Management,  6) Precision Tracking and Targeting, 7) Weapon Effectiveness Assessment, 8) Information Management of Logistics, 9) Distributed Control of Networked Autonomous Robotic Platforms, and 10) Urban Warfare Technology.  Further details on technical areas, program phases, selection criteria, and Submission Instructions may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) which can be accessed at http://www.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations/IXO/index.htm.      TECHNICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INQUIRIES:  DARPA intends to use electronic mail for correspondence regarding BAA 04-17.  Technical, contractual, or administrative questions must be sent to BAA04-17@darpa.mil. Answers to all questions generally relevant to the technical, contractual, and administrative aspects of the solicitation will be posted at http://www.darpa.mil/IXO/Solicitations/IXO/index.htm under Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) for public access.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  This notice is for planning and information purposes.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and the Government is not committed or obligated to pay for any information submitted in response to this notice, and no basis for claim shall arise as a result of this notice or contractor response to this notice.  Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport, Rhode Island wishes to consult with and discuss an Engineering Development Model (EDM) procurement of an imaging and electronic warfare sensor system for the Virginia Class submarine.   This sensor subsystem is named the Low Profile Mast (LPM).  LPM will be used on the Virginia Class submarine and will be located in the Mission Configurable Mast (MCM) bay within a standard Universal Modular Mast (UMM). The LPM development effort aims to develop a non-hull penetrating periscope system with similar or improved features, performance, and functions of the Type 18 periscope to provide a mast stealthier than the Photonics Mast for littoral operations.   Performance levels achieved by the current Type 18 periscope system set the normal capabilities for electronic imaging and electronic warfare functions.  Image processing and electronic warfare processing functions will be implemented in inboard processing and conditioning units (IPCU) to achieve interoperability with Virginia Class tactical systems.  Control and display functions are to be handled via virtual workstation software.   Because of the complexity associated with this development, the government has conducted a series of technical risk mitigation activities on the optical bench design, electronic imager, Radio Frequency (RF) antenna arrangement, RF interconnect and signal distribution, microwave photonic links, rotary seal mechanism, underwater electrical and fiber-optic hybrid cables, connectors and rotary joints, and control/display integration with Virginia Class inboard tactical imaging and electronic warfare systems.  Knowledge gained from the government's risk mitigation effort will be made available to potential offerors for information purposes only.  The desired functional characteristics of the LPM subsystem are as follows:
1. System Architecture
The LPM System Architecture will be an open hardware and software architecture.  Incremental upgrades will be facilitated by modular mechanical, electrical, and RF interfaces.
2. Physical Characteristics
LPM sensor module will be a pressure proofed, non-penetrating mast with a maximum outer diameter of 7.5 inches. The sensor module will be housed within a UMM in the MCM bay position.  The maximum height will be constrained by the existing UMM, and the height of the optical line of sight will be approximately 23 inches below the top of the sensor module.  Electronic warfare capability will be provided by antennas, which will be part of the sensor module, with signal distribution components housed inside the mast module.  The estimated length of the sensor module, which includes the Electronic Warfare Support (ES) antennas, optical bench, cameras, cooling, and electronics, should be about eight feet. An external rotational mechanism is required to train the sensor module to provide 360-degree azimuthal coverage clockwise and counter-clockwise with no restrictions. Radar Cross Section reduction will be provided by a radar camouflage unit similar to the one used for the Type 18 periscope. Advanced paint and/or cover material should be considered to further reduce radar, visual, and infrared signatures.  Active cooling and/or heat removal may be required to improve reliability and reduce infrared signature.  The LPM Subsystem will be capable of being operated totally stand alone or interfaced with existing Virginia Class submarine Imaging, Electronic Warfare Support (ES), Combat Control System (CC), and Exterior Communication Systems (ECS).  
3. Electro-optical Sensing
Optical sensing will be provided by an optical bench and a number of imaging sensors covering the visible light (0.45 to 0.65 micron), near infrared (0.65 to 0.90 micron), and short wave infrared (0.90 to 1.80 micron) optical spectra to provide video images at least 30 frames per second.  The desired optical fields of view are 32, 12, 4, and 2 degrees horizontal, all with a 4 (H) to 3 (V) aspect ratio.  The optical line of sight must be stabilized to 25 micro radians or better.  Elevation coverage with respect to the optical axis is 10 degrees (down) to 60 degrees (up).   
4. RF Sensing
LPM antennas will be in a cylindrical volume within the sensor module to house RF sensors and associated components.  RF sensors will facilitate two functions: ES and support functions.  The required ES functions are omni-directional intercept, radar threat early warning for pulse radar, and automatic direction finding for radar signals.  The required RF support functions are GPS navigation (bands L1, L2, and L5), Iridium communication (transmit and receive), and built-in-test function with in board signal injection.  GPS and Iridium may share the same antenna.  In order to accommodate future capabilities, the antenna design must include a six-inch high cylindrical growth space with signal path and power line provision. 
5. High Speed High Data Rate Data Transport
Fiber optic data transport for a portion of the RF spectrum and digital video streams may be necessary for this application.  Linkage between the non-penetrating LPM outboard equipment and inboard processing electronics will be provided by various cables, fiber optic rotary joint, slip rings, and electrical hull fittings that support both fiber optic and copper based conduits.
6. Conditioning, Processing, and Distribution of Sensor Outputs
Inboard electronics will be necessary to demodulate, process, and distribute RF signals to receivers and processing equipment to maintain the same signal and data interfaces to existing tactical ES system.  LPM subsystem's RF processing will include radar direction finding and radar early warning.  Other inboard processing will include digital image acquisition, real time image processing, display processing, high fidelity storage, and random access retrieval.  Digital video signal will be routed to existing tactical workstations via industry standard real time network protocols.
7. Control and Display
A virtual workstation capability will be required to allow the LPM system operation from multiple workstations.  Remote operation of the LPM will include sensor line of sight control, field of view change, camera selection, camera adjustment, system operation and performance monitoring and fault isolation. Control and display will also provide network connectivity to obtain ownship’s information and exchange contact information and imagery with Tactical Control and other shipboard subsystems including off-board image transmission.  A competitive RFP for the entire EDM LPM sub-system is planned for issue during second quarter of FY06.  The program's inventory objective through FY11 is eight (8) systems inclusive of the EDM.  Industry teaming is strongly encouraged to meet the technical requirements of the LPM subsystem.  This second Industry Day is scheduled for Wednesday, 8 February 2006.

<DESC>Military Applications in Reconnaissance and Surveillance (MARS) using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for Toxic Industrial Chemical Sensing Success of current and future military operations is conditioned upon rapidly detecting threats, assessing them, and acting decisively to negate the threats in order to achieve operational objectives with minimal risk. As demonstrated in the last three maj or U.S. overseas military combat operations, potential adversary threats involving weapons of mass destruction (WMD) have impacted the application of U.S. military force.   During Operation Allied Force (OAF), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), and Operatio n Iraqi Freedom (OIF), U.S. forces were concerned about encountering a variety of adversary threats, including those from Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) warfare agents.  For OAF, USEUCOM specifically addressed the potential for Serbian use of chemical warfare agents and accidental release of warfare agents and toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) during counterforce operations.  For OEF, USCENTCOM responded to a wide variety of Taliban threats, including those chemical and biological in nat ure.  During OIF, intelligence reports on Iraqi NBC threats required U.S. forces to expend significant resources to reduce the risk of these threats. Overall, improvement in U.S. forces CBRN sensing capabilities would increase an operational commanders a bility to quickly detect and assess these threats thereby improving operational effectiveness. In recent combat operations, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been demonstrated as critical assets on the battlefield to not only reduce the risk of endangering soldiers, but also to increase the efficiency of surveillance and reconnaissance. While the  U.S has introduced UAVs with mission specific payload packages to conduct a variety of military operations, to this point, no CBRN specific UAV-based sensor packages have been operationally employed. DTRA is confident that there are mature technologies av ailable to fulfill portions of the aerial CBRN sensing mission.  Therefore, to complement unmanned ground-based CBRN system evaluations the MARS UAV project has been stood up to incorporate views of the Joint Requirements Office (JRO), the Joint Procuremen t Executive Office (JPEO), and the Joint Science and Technology Office (JSTO).  In addition to the development of CONOPS and standardized test protocol, the MARS M/UAV project is chartered with leveraging existing, mature technology to provide a framework for integration of capable sensors into existing airframes so that the warfighters will have the aerial based tools they require. A logical first step to deal with these threats is to focus on the incorporation of TIC sensors in a UAV.  TICs of concern are from the NATO International Task Force 25 (ITF-25) list, and are expected to be at significant concentrations, typically from a p oint source.  However, follow on efforts will likely work to address CBRN sensing, and such capabilities (or potential for) are considered favorable towards sensor selection. The UAV platform is currently unspecified.  However, design constraints are listed in the following table: Dimensions:	Threshold 10inches(L) X 6inches(W) X 7inches(H),   Objective 9inches(L) X 5inches(W) X 6inches(H) Weight:	Threshold less than 10 lbs  Objective less than 7 lbs Power		Threshold 60 W at 28 VDC  Objective 30 W at 28 VDC  Data Interface Required, but unspecified There are no other restrictions besides those listed in this document and subsequent informational releases.  Sensors may be point or standoff.  The desire is to assess and select sensors at the JPEOs Technology Readiness Level of 5 or greater.  However, vendors are encouraged to present technologies that may currently be below this TRL, but show near term promise for these applications.  The Edgewood Chemical Biological Centers Battlefield Management Team has put together a T echnology Screening Integrated Process Team to evaluate vendor proposals to fill these defined mission needs and specifications.

<SUBJECT>Q -- Market Research for Active Duty Dental Program (ADDP) Services
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR COMMENTS ON A DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK AS PART OF MARKET RESEARCH FOR A POSSIBLE FUTURE TRICARE CONTRACT AS A FOLLOW-ON TO REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SPECIAL NOTICE #05-128. 

The Department of Defense (DoD), TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is in the initial stage of developing future requirements for dental insurance carriers to provide dental services, including the processing and payment of dental claims, for Active Duty Service Members (ADSMs) residing within the United States and some of its territories under the Active Duty Dental Program.  As part of its market research, the Government is seeking industry input with regards to its draft statement of work (SOW) which may be found under “Market Survey” Special Notice, Reference Number 05-ADDP on the TRICARE Website at http://www.tricare.osd.mil/contracting/healthcare/index.cfm
  Comments are solicited as to whether the language included in the draft SOW is sufficiently descriptive/detailed and broad enough in scope, includes applicable and necessary standard industry/commercial practices, and establishes reasonable objectives and obtainable standards that can be measured and used in conjunction with possible performance incentives. Comments/suggestions on additional aspects of the draft SOW are encouraged and may also be submitted. All comments/suggestions made should be stated in generic/broad and nonproprietary terms.  A summary of the Government’s needs are basically as follows:  A potential offeror must tender its current nation-wide dental network of credentialed providers to the Program and its most favorable network fee schedule or discounts; however, in remote locations, claims from non-network providers will be submitted for payment. Certain claims are required to be preauthorized by Government personnel prior to payment.  The dental benefit structure will be a full-spectrum of possible dental procedures; however, the contractor will pay claims based solely on the specified procedures in the authorizations above a dollar threshold and will make no benefit determinations.  Please submit your comments to Mr. Graham Kolb at TRICARE Management Activity, 16401 East Centretech Parkway, Aurora, CO 80011-9066, or by e-mail at james.kolb@tma.osd.mil.  We will consider your comments whenever received; however, as we plan to make decisions within the next 30 days, we request your comments as soon as possible. The government will not be publishing or responding in a public forum to any comments or questions as part of this market research.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

MEMORANDUM FOR 42 CONS

FROM:  COMMANDANT, US AIR FORCE SENIOR NCO ACADEMY
	 550 McDonald Street
	 MAFB-Gunter Annex, AL  36114

SUBJECT:  Sole Source Request for CMSgt Leadership Course Contract AF Form 9# F2XHC95322A100

1.  This is a sole source request for contractual services supporting effective delivery of the Air Force CMSgt Leadership Course (CLC) during CY06 with the Center for Creative Leadership (CCL).  The CCL provides training for 13 out 57 contact hours of the CLC.  The CCL provides specific tailored curriculum to support key objectives of our course in keeping with Air Staff direction to provide an educational experience commensurate with that of General Officer, Senior Executive Service (SES) members, and GS-15s attending Senior Leader Orientation Course.  These contact hours support the Developing CMSgt block of instruction.  

2. The AFSNCOA, USAF Force Development, and CCL worked together to create a specifically tailored course for newly promoted CMSgts.  CCL’s curriculum piece is approved by the CEPME and we must provide a consistent training experience for the USAF to approximately 700 new CMSgts annually.   This course is taught only at only one place in the world…the AFSNCOA.   CCL’s role is critical to these 13 curriculum hours.    The dates for CCL role in this course are as follows:  

CLC 06A , 24-27 Feb 06; CLC 06B 1-3 May 06; and CLC 06C, 28-31 Jul 06	

3.  Currently CCL provides strategic leadership training to select General Officers, Command CMSgts, and SES members.  CCL works solely with USAF Senior Leadership and ensures mirrored consistency with doctrinal concepts for senior officer courses, managed by HQ USAF, and ensures direct connectivity for the unified development of strategic AF leaders.  CCL is the only company that can provide mirrored consistency in this educational training because they worked exclusively with Air Force senior leadership, Force Development, and the AFSNCOA to create courseware that has been fine-tuned and performed at a 98 percent approval rating.  This courseware was specifically designed for the CLC and CCL owns exclusive rights to this training program.  Air Staff, PME Functional Manager, CMSgt Denise Alexander directed us to continue to execute the same course for FY-06.  CCL’s courseware has a proven track record that meets the unique needs of AF CMSgts.

4.  No action is being taken at this time to preclude the necessity for future sole source of this training requirement.  USAF Force Development has directed us to maintain consistency in senior leader training.  

5.  Request expeditious handling of this contract and that it be sole sourced to CCL due to the unique nature of the services provided.  Newly promoted CMSgts are being scheduled by Air Staff to attend this course. Please direct any questions regarding this sole source request to Mr. XXXXXXXXXXXXX.

STATEMENT OF WORK

I. Title:	Sew Filter Panels and Insect Screens for Outdoor Mesocosms at US EPA, Corvallis, Oregon

II. Date:	January 12, 2006  

III. Background:   According to the statutory authorities granted to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) under the Plant Pest Act and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) respectively, non-deregulated materials such as genetically modified plants that have not been approved for use in commerce, need to be grown under conditions of pollen confinement. Examples of pollen confinement methods include the use of screening that has pore sizes smaller than that of the pollen of the plants being studied.  Restriction of access of insects is also an important consideration in limiting gene flow from insect-pollinated genetically modified (GM) plants.  The types of plants being studied by USEPA in Corvallis, Oregon for potential effects of gene flow from a prototype GM crop to compatible crop and weed species include: oilseed rape (canola), wild mustard, and various hybrids of those compatible plant species.  To insure the scientific integrity of our studies and to also be in compliance with federal (USDA and USEPA) and state (Oregon Department of Agriculture) regulations for studies with GM plants, the ecological studies USEPA plans to do in the mesocosms at USEPA in Corvallis, Oregon needs to be carried out under conditions of pollen confinement.  The means of obtaining pollen confinement in the mesocosms (specialized circular plastic greenhouses) include the use of custom-designed panels of special filter medium that will have 95% efficiency in blocking the passage of small pollen particles (25 microns in diameter). 

USEPA will deliver materials to the Contractor, however, the Contractor is responsible for delivering the completed work to the USEPA. 

IV. Scope/Objective Statement:  The Contractor shall sew 22 pollen filters and 44 insect screen panels using USEPA supplied pollen filter media, insect screen netting, webbing, and thread.  In addition, USEPA will provide all rope for rope channels with the Contractor installing ropes in all rope channels.  Upon completion, the filter panels and insect screens will be securely attached to mesocosm units at the USEPA in Corvallis, Oregon by USEPA personnel to prevent the egress of pollen from the mesocosm units.

V. Task Description:  The Contractor shall cut, sew and assemble the materials in the dimensions specified in Figures 1 and 2 so that they shall securely fit the tops of the mesocosm units.  The following specifications are required.

1.	The Contractor shall use only USEPA-supplied materials for fabricating pollen filter panels and insect screens.
2.	The Contractor shall install USEPA-supplied rope in sewn rope channels on all filter panels and insect screens.  Equal amounts of rope shall extend past each end of the installed rope channel on all sewn panels. (Note: “equal amounts” will depend upon the length of rope provided by USEPA. It may be 3’ or 2’ 10”, depending upon the length of rope provided. The Contractor is just required to insure equal amounts of rope extend past each end of the rope channel.)
3.	Using USEPA-supplied bonded polyester thread, the Contractor shall sew all seams at no less than 5 stitches per inch and no more than 6 stitches per inch.
4.	22 pollen filter panels shall be sewn and assembled according to dimensions and instructions shown in Figure 1.
5.	44 insect screens shall be sewn and assembled according to dimensions and instructions shown in Figure 2.

VI. Milestones and Deliverables
-The Contractor shall deliver the first fully assembled pollen filter panel and the first two fully assembled insect screens to USEPA, 200 S.W. 35th Street, Corvallis, OR 97333 within 14 days of contract award. 
- USEPA will install the initial filter panel and screens on a mesocosm to confirm its proper fit within 7 days of receipt and indicate any minor modifications that may be needed to improve the fit to maximize pollen confinement.
-The Contractor shall assemble the remaining 21 pollen filter units and 42 insect screen within 30 days after receiving written feedback from USEPA
-Latest acceptable date for completion of the full order is March 1, 2006.

VII. Acceptance Criteria: The pollen filter panels and insect screens shall each fit securely to the tops of the mesocosm units and shall be free of holes that would permit egress of pollen or entrance of flying insects such as bees or flies.

VIII. Applicable and Controlling Documents: See attached Figures of pollen Filter Media and Insect Screen.

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.

(2) Be filed with the Contracting Officer.

(3) State whether the protestor chooses to have the Contracting Officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the protest is silent on this matter, the Contracting Officer will decide the protest.

WRITTEN JUSTIFICATION FOR A SPECIFIC MAKE OR MODEL
The agency’s need for the Drug Abuse Treatment Protocol Journals listed above can only be provided by one source (The Change Companies).  To obtain similar journals from another vendor would require the re-development of the Drug Abuse Treatment Protocol, which would not be economically feasible and would not provide timely delivery.  The Change Companies designed and developed the Drug Abuse Treat Protocol Journals.  The journals are copyrighted and may not be reproduced or utilized in any form or by any means, electronic or mechanical, including photocopying, without written permission from The Change Companies.  The BOP now has a requirement to receive these journals and The Change Companies is the only available source who can fulfill the BOP’s requirement.

The IBDB workflow application will use electronically available contract, timekeeping, and other resource-use data to assist with the processing of commitments, obligations, accruals, payments, and reporting.  Contract support is required to design, develop, and implement an interface that will be used to record into the Foundation Financial Information System (FFIS) the commitments, obligations, accruals, and payments.  The interface will send data to and from FFIS.  Quantity one (1) each, lump sum.  Required delivery date no later than May 31, 2006.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a sole source extension to SAIC contract NAMA-01-C-0005. The purpose of this acquisition is to extend Contract NAMA-01-C-0005 awarded in June 2001 by one year in order to provide continued Contractor support to the Interagency Working Group (IWG).  Unless the extension is made the contract will fall one year short of the term of the IWG.  Authorized by the Nazi war Crimes Disclosure act of 1998 (PL 105-246) and established by President Clinton on January 11, 1999, the Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group (IWG) had a mission to locate, inventory, recommend for declassification and expedite the release of relevant records.    On December 6, 2000, Congress extended the life of the IWG through passage of the Japanese Imperial Government Disclosure Act (PL 106-567).  This new Act renamed the group the Nazi War Crimes and Japanese Imperial Government Records Working Group and expanded its mandate to include declassification of records related to Japanese war crimes as part of its mandate.  The Act extended the life of the IWG for 3 years. In January 2004, Congress extended the term of the IWG for a year.  Then is March, 2005, Congress extended the term of the IWG for an additional two years through March, 2007.  The requirements for support services are growing.  The expansion of the IWG’s mandate into the Japanese area with the goal to more completely cover the records relating to Japanese war crimes resulted in the recruitment of an expert historian in Japanese history during World War II through the vehicle of the support contract, and his work now in progress will result in another IWG volume devoted solely to the Far Eastern war crimes.  The 2005 extension of the IWG also resulted in a stronger effort to identify and review for declassification extensive records from intelligence agencies on the Nazi phase of war crimes and, these newly located records now are undergoing review and analysis by the expert historians in European World War II history who had been recruited through the support contract and already have worked on the large quantities of Nazi war crime records declassified during the earlier years of the project..  Consequently, there is a need for Contractor support services beyond the term of the current contract. The contract modification will be issued on or about March 31, 2006. This requirement is determined to be available from only one source because of the very steep learning curve for the very unique services provided. Questions concerning this requirement may be directed to ATTN: Mrs. Helen Merriwether at (EMAIL: helen.merriwether@nara.gov; Fax: 301.837.3227) Telephone requests will not be Honored *****
