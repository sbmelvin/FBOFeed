<SOLNBR>FA8726-05-R-0002
<RESPDATE>041805
<ARCHDATE>05182005
<CONTACT>Mr. Richard Fox, Contracting Officer (781) 271-2131, e-mail Richard.Fox@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>Electronic Systems Center (ESC) is seeking qualified sources for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) acquisition phase of the Airborne and Maritime/Fixed Station (AMF) Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) program.  The AMF JTRS will be a hardware-configurable and software-programmable radio system that provides increased interoperability, flexibility, and adaptability to support the varied mission requirements of the warfighter.  AMF JTRS will operate with legacy equipment and waveforms currently used by civilian and military airborne, surface, subsurface, and fixed station platforms. The Request for Proposal (RFP) for the SDD contract is expected to be released in August 2005. <br><br> The scope of the SDD contract will include critical design of the JTR demonstrated in a Critical Design Review (CDR); hardware and software development; delivery of  Engineering Development Models (EDMs) and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) units to meet platform requirements; waveform porting, including interacting with the JTRS Technology Laboratory (JTeL) for Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliance testing and with the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) for waveform compliance and interoperability certification; conducting AMF JTRS contractor development testing (DT); supporting Government DT, Operational Assessment (OA), technical evaluation (TECHEVAL), and operational evaluation (OPEVAL) testing.  We anticipate the contract will include priced options for LRIP, initial spares, associated technical data, platform integration, installation support, and sustainment. The prime contractor will be required to qualify at least two JTR production sources prior to LRIP.  The winning SDD contractor will be excluded from being a JTR production source, but may provide Service Integration Kits (SIKs) and ancillary equipment. <br><br> The AMF JTRS program has a two-phase development strategy:  Pre-SDD and SDD.  Pre-SDD is focused on the system architectures and initial designs for the AMF JTRS.  The outcomes will include design drivers and platform interface requirements that drive cost.  The goal is to help refine SDD contract requirements and analyze alternative approaches in order to assess risks.  In September 2004, two Pre-SDD phase Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts, expected to last fifteen (15) months, were awarded via full and open competition to Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The Pre-SDD Prime Contractors are expected to deliver Preliminary Design Review (PDR) level designs for Joint Tactical Radio (JTR) form factors, ancillary equipment, and designs for Service Integration Kits. Key data deliverables include system specifications, top-level Interface Control Documents (ICDs), draft item specifications, a life cycle cost model, trade studies, and risk reduction analyses. <br><br> Detailed requirements and Pre-SDD reference material for this system can be found at http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil/rfp_list.asp, and then click on "Airborne, Maritime, and Fixed Station Joint Tactical Radio System."

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, 
Fax: (703) 875-4009; PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE. PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Francisco Rubio Cardenas, President & CEO, SNL Logistics, S.A. de C.V.; Calle “E” No. 4 Fracc, Rubio, La Mesa; Tijuana, B.C. Mexico C.P. 22116; Phone: 52-(664) 689-1208, Ext. 17; Fax: 52 (664) 689-2309 E-mail: Frubio@icanet.com.mx. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to assist the City of Tijuana and SNL Logistics, S.A. de C.V., in the design and development of the proposed Tijuana Intermodal Terminal (TIT) in Northwest Mexico.

The proposed TIT will address the current lack of adequate and efficient transportation infrastructure, a critical factor in enhancing regional competitiveness through reduced costs related to cargo management and shipment.  At present, Tijuana’s infrastructure is overburdened by road traffic as the actual flow of goods (raw materials, components and finished goods) for the regional maquila industry moving in both directions (north and south), is in excess of 3,000 trucks per day.  To alleviate this congestion, and create a more efficient and cost-effective transportation solution, the TIT will involve the construction of a terminal located on land within the El Florido Industrial Park.  The planned site is centrally located to connect the principal distribution channels in the area: the Port of Ensenada, the Tijuana Airport, the Mexicali Intermodal Terminal, and the Carrizo Gorge Railway which connects with Union Pacific distribution lines in the Southwest U.S. offering a critical connection to activities in Los Angeles and Long Beach.  The terminal will provide a hub to enhance trade logistics for both international and domestic shipments, as well as the possibility for obtaining coveted Customs pre-clearance.

SNL Logistics will be responsible for the financing of the TIT.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $427,861 grant to the Grantees from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 3:00 PM, April 22, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>This synopsis replaces the synopsis posted on October 15, 2004 due to a change in Contract Specialists/Contracting Officers. This solicitation modifies the list of potential tasks and the selection criteria and requires interested firms to submit or re-submit their qualifications using only the SF 330. This applies to firms that have previously responded as well as those that have not yet responded. The response date is open and will remain open indefinitely. Note: You will not be notified unless your firm has been selected to perform a task (see below).

In this synopsis, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AO) requests submission of SF 330s (only) by Architectural/Engineering firms desiring to be considered for government contracts not to exceed $100,000. The SF 330 information will be compiled and managed in a database by a permanent AO Architect/Engineer Selection Board. Please do not submit any information other than the SF 330 as it will be discarded. Only the SF 330 will be filed and stored, and only information in the SF 330 will be entered in the database and considered for potential tasks. No actual contract documentation or construction administration (or new building designs) will result as part of these broad-based Architectural/Engineering services tasks. Tasks will consist of providing limited assistance to the judiciary and the AO on individual projects, primarily as conducted for the judiciary by the General Services Administration (GSA). Tasks may include, but are not limited to, project-related program and design analysis and evaluation; small scale schematic design; furniture and interiors services; technical document reviews; value engineering services; architectural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and structural analysis and evaluation; historical preservation studies; courtroom technologies consultation; blast-resistant and security design criteria development; environmental (sick building) testing and analysis; and preparation of other studies and reports to support the judiciary. Potential tasks will be geographically located only throughout the 50 United States and the U.S. Territories. Travel may be, but is not always, required. In no prioritized order of importance, individual tasks will be awarded to firms based on a combination of the following criteria: (1) Past performance on contracts with the judiciary, other government entities, and private industry, in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with the U.S. Courts Design Guide and performance schedules; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required; (3) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services; (4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; and (5) Staffed location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality. In making the award determination for each task the AO Architect/Engineer Selection Board will rank the firms most qualified to perform the work and provide its list to the Contracting Officer (CO) who will review it, make the final selection list, attempt to negotiate a fair and reasonable price with the firm ranked first and, if successful, award to that firm. If unsuccessful, the CO will attempt to negotiate with the next firm on the list and so forth, until award is made or it is necessary to request an additional listing from the selection board. This process will continue until award is accomplished.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>UPDATE 25 March 2005:  The Airborne Electronic Attack Squadron (AEASS) cannot release the B-52 SOJ RFP until final approval of the acquisition strategy  and  the source selection plan.  We anticipate that may take another two weeks.  In  the interim, we plan to post an updated draft in the next few days to pass on  the incremental changes that have been incorporated in the document.   The biggest change in the draft is the increased emphasis on the early  delivery of a capability.  We have identified additional FY 05 funds and have  raised the first year of the funding profile from $1.5M to $2M.  There are  significant changes in the OCI clause.  It is recommended that you give the  RFP a careful review due to the number of small changes. As you are aware, we have been on a very aggressive schedule.  The delays we  are experiencing put our contract award schedule at risk.  We are requesting  your cooperation in helping us make up some schedule time by reducing the  number of days required for proposal preparation.  If you plan to bid this  program, request you provide the PCO feedback on the acceptability of reducing  the number of days for proposal submission from 45 days to a lesser number,  and identify the minimum time you believe is required.  Request your response  by 1 April 2005.  When a go-ahead is received from SAF/AQ and OSD, the AEASS  will determine the proposal due date and adjust the expected contract award  date accordingly.  UPDATE 22 March 2005:  A new attachment with the title of Questions and  Answers has been added to the document library below. UPDATE 21 March 2005:  Proposal due date information is changed as follows:   If the RFP is not released by 1 April 2005, there will be a day for day slip  in the proposal due date.   Also, information about the Past Performance volume due date is changed to  read as follows: Each offeror is requested to submit the Past Performance volume for relevant  Government contracts 28 days prior to the date established for receipt of  proposals.  Failure to submit early proposal information (Past Performance  volume) will not result in offeror disqualification.  Offerors are requested  to notify the PCO when the Past Performance volume is anticipated to be  submitted. UPDATE 9 March 2005 (Second update for this date):  RFP release is delayed  pending completion of the Government+s review/approval process.  Tentative  date for release is now 25 March 2005, in which case proposals will be due by  10 May 2005. However, the Past Performance Volume will be due by 15 Apr 2005.   The Government still plans to award the contract by the end of July 2005. Section L - Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors is modified by  making the following change to Table 3.1 Proposal Organization in Paragraph  3.1.5.2, Organization, Number of Copies, and Page Limits.  The maximum page  limit for Vol III, Past Performance, is now 60 pages.  Within those 60 pages,  there should be no more than 5 pages per each past contract. UPDATE 9 March 2005:  The briefings and documents promised at the B-52 Stand- off Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference on 16 Feb 2005 are now available for  distribution.  There are two CDs available for distribution.  The first CD  (unclassified) was mailed on 7 Mar 05 to each company /office that attended  the conference.  The second CD (classified) is available for local  representatives of any company which attended the conference to pick up.   Dayton representatives from these companies are encouraged to pick up the  classified CDs on the afternoon of 11 March from security representatives at  Bldg 556.  In order to identify the individual who is picking up the CD,  please fax a visit request to the following address:   ASC/LRS-SF (ATTN: Carol Golden) 2690 Loop Road West, Bldg 556, WPAFB OH 45433-7148 Fax: 937-656-4612 Phone: 937-656-5163 If a Dayton representative is not available, the classified CDs will be mailed  to attendees who requested them.  Questions on CD distribution can be  addressed to Capt Rick Holifield (937-656-5099). In addition, a second classified CD containing historical documentation is  available for those companies who have indicated they plan to bid as an LSI.   These companies can request this additional CD by calling Stephanie Shelley (937-656-5037) to justify the need to know. UPDATE 8 March 05:  Section L - Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to  Offerors is hereby amended to change the font requirement for graphics only.   Paragraph 3.1.5.6, Page Size and Format, is changed as follows: For tables, charts, graphs and figures, the font shall be no smaller than 8  point. Also, paragraph 3.1.5.5, Page Limitations, is revised by adding the following  sentence:   	Offerors may attach an Executive Summary of no more than 4 pages to  their transmittal letter.  Neither will be considered in the overall page  count nor will they be evaluated. UPDATE 2 March 05:	Limited Access to a B-52H aircraft for potential  bidders for the Lead Systems Integrator (LSI) Purpose:  The government shall provide potential bidders limited access to a B- 52H aircraft as part of the B-52 RFP process for a Lead Systems Integrator  (LSI) for the Pre-Systems Development and Demonstration phase of the B-52  Stand Off-Jammer program.

REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16 –  17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractor’s subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircraft’s strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

It is  important that you provide your comments and questions because they will be  used in developing the final Request for Proposal (RFP).  There are two areas  of particular interest we would like to hear from industry.  First, is how to  handle Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs) after contract completion.  Secondly,  some of the foreign PROS users would like the ability to return material  purchased through the PROS program, for any reason, within 90 days of  receipt.  This does not include requirements submitted for investigation under  the Supply Discrepancy Report (SDR) process.  Foreign customer SDRs will be  processed through the standard SDR process.   SOURCES SOUGHT FOR THE PARTS AND REPAIR ORDERING SYSTEM III (PROS III)  ACQUISITION EFFORT To:  All Prospective Offerors					6 August 2004 Subject:  Solicitation FA8630-04-R-5063, Sources Sought Parts and Repair  Ordering System III (PROS III)  1.  INTRODUCTION: The Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC), as the  interface between the United States Department of Defense (DoD) logistics  systems and Security Assistance (SA) customers, is responsible for providing  comprehensive logistic support.  This interface includes fulfilling the  requirements of all Foreign Military Sales (FMS) countries that own and  operate  weapon systems of U.S. origin.  AFSAC+s mission is to recognize the  individualized needs of each FMS country, and develop support options that are  cost effective, timely and efficient for our FMS customers and the DoD.  Weapon systems and military material items sold by the DoD are supported by  AFSAC.  Comprehensive logistical support for FMS customers creates some unique  challenges.  Many FMS items are not of a type or configuration currently  active  in DoD’s inventories.  These items or requirements are considered to be non- standard. Many FMS supply requirements for older or customer unique material do not have  management data available. Some supply items may not have been catalogued due  to low or infrequent usage. Low quantities or dollar value requested may not  justify the administrative cost and time required to support a non-standard  supply requirement.  In other cases, when item management responsibilities do  exist, high DoD demand may take precedence over FMS supply requirements for  limited resources.  The result is unacceptably slow and unreliable support to  the FMS customer. Frequently, neither the organic capability nor the contractual supportability  exists within the DoD for maintenance of non-standard material.  The FMS  customer must contract direct commercial or do without support.  Some  customers  have set up procurement offices in the United States to alleviate these  difficulties; however, most do not have the resources or volume of business to  justify this option.  Non-standard items are those that are no longer, or have never been, actively  managed within the DoD logistics systems.  These also include Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS) items, and those standard items that the Military Departments  (MILDEPs) have deemed to be unobtainable within a reasonable time period.  The  difficulties in supporting these FMS requirements are being addressed through  ongoing Parts + Repair Ordering System II (PROS II) contract that is valid  through 4 December 2005.  The PROS III program is a follow-on effort to PROS II intended to fill the gap  in logistical support, and will allow additional options for maintaining DoD  support to our FMS customers.  By contracting out these specialized functions,  the requirement for DoD manpower is reduced, and the FMS customer receives  more  efficient support. 2.  Contract Effort Description: The PROS Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items,  maintenance services and the management of task orders.  The contract is  managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor’s  performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing,  quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer.  The PROS  II program goal is to provide “one stop shopping” for the FMS country.        The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite  quantity  (ID/IQ), period of performance Dec 00 – Dec 05 (3-year base period  with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), time and material  (task  orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and award fee. Historical Environment  Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The potential 80 plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure  rates.   The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate  computations makes predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not  stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is  not  a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) are waived by the USAF for  supply  action usually due to inability to meet an established need date.  However,  the  managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD  approved  sources. Approximately 25,000 supply requisitions are issued per year.             Approximately 75% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being  maintenance and task orders. This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service.  The majority of  the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair  service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service.  The successful bidder  for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of  the  contract.  The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized)  sources  of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for  specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and award  fee  incentives. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy  Reports  (SDRs).  This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year  after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have  been completed several years before.  The successful bidder shall be advised  to  make arrangements to address this potential liability.  NOTE: The Supply  Discrepancy Report (SDR) process has been problematic in the previous and  current contract. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and  responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on  structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract amount is pass through costs for  procuring required parts and services.  Desirable Features Desire competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with  OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings – best available price – minimizing participation fees Turn around time – shortest possible lead-time – lead-time from after receipt  of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of  contractor  performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or  unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.

Approximately 188,000 gross square feet of the 1.2 million gross square foot building will be renovated in this project.     Estimated award range is $20,000,000 to $30,000,000.     Completion time is 715 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about August 29, 2005.     This contract is restricted and limited to only those firms having (1) an existing general construction contracting office as of the date of this announcement within the four state region     consisting of Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska; (2) meeting the minimum requirement of having worked on a similar or partially similar project ? defined as an interior office renovation or other renovation project with a high level of interior finishes and complexity (new construction projects will not be evaluated); (3) a hazardous materials abatement subcontractor whose on-site supervisors for this project possess the Supervisor / Missouri State Certificate for Asbestos Related Occupations and their most recent required refresher training certificate; and (4) a data wiring subcontractor whose on-site supervisor for this project has been certified by Building Industry Consulting Services International, Inc. (BICSI).

This project will be limited to floors 11 through 14; miscellaneous lobby work on floors 15, 16 and 18; and stair towers on floors 11 through 18.     The building will be occupied during construction, however floors 13 and 14 will be initially vacant.     The 12th floor tenant will vacate the floor and move to 14 after completion of 14th floor work, the 11th floor tenant will move to 13, the 10th floor tenant will move to 12 and the 9th floor tenant will move to 11.     Limited above ceiling work on the 10th floor generally related to 11th floor plumbing is also required.     Base Bid Work:     Generally consists of general demolition, and asbestos and lead paint abatement; reconfiguration of existing shaft openings; seismic bracing of shaft walls; complete renovation of lobbies and restrooms including reconfiguration of restrooms; wood paneling, terrazzo, drywall partitions, paint and plaster, new ceramic tile walls and floors; new ceilings, lighting and above ceiling HVAC throughout the floor; and new building signage/graphics.

Phased substantial completion dates are required.

Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.     Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.     The Government will not indemnify against such risk.     Construction work disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed outside of normal business hours.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures.     The Government intends to use the ?trade-off process? in selecting the prime contractor.     The ?trade-off process? is a method of evaluating both the technical factors specified in the solicitation, the price and an optional in-person interview.     For this solicitation, the goal is to select the proposal that offers the best combination of technical qualifications, price and an optional interview.     The Government intends to award the contract to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, with technical factors being considered more important than price. The object is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily to select the lowest price. Proposals will be evaluated in three stages.     Stage One, the Request for Technical Proposals (RFTP) will be issued on or about 01-24-05.     The RFTP will consist of technical evaluations to establish those within a competitive range. The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel, (3) Management Plan, and (4) Sustainable Construction Materials and Methods.     Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality.     Offerors whose proposals fall within the competitive range will be invited by the Government to make Stage Two submissions, which shall consist of Pricing, a subcontracting plan and special competency requirements. Offerors whose technical evaluations do not meet minimum requirements will be notified by phone or letter that they will not be allowed to submit a price proposal. Offerors whose technical evaluations are not in the competitive range will also be so notified; however their price proposals will still be received and evaluated. Pricing Packages will be issued on or about April 11, 2005.     Initial Price proposals will be received in this office on or about May 20, 2005. Offerors should submit Stage Two price proposals that are acceptable without additional information, as the Government may make the final determination regarding a proposal?s acceptability based solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted. The Government may proceed with the award of the contract without discussion. However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors. A request for final price proposals will be issued on or about May 29, 2005.     The offeror with the highest technical rank and the lowest price will be considered the most advantageous.     If the ranks of two or more offerors are approximately equal, the higher technical proposal will be the offer considered most advantageous. As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important.     If the selection board deems it necessary or desirable, they may invite selected firms to an in-person interview, which shall constitute Stage Three. Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the combination of technical qualifications, price and the interview, if held, that is the most advantageous to the Government. The Government will evaluate all proposals that meet the minimum requirements.     

The Request for Technical Proposal (RFTP) includes a general scope of work, completed Design Development level drawings and outline specifications, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.     In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).     GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of construction solicitations and amendments.     The solicitation (specifications and drawings) and its amendments will only be available through a link in FedBizOpps to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.     Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.     Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov ) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov ).     As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications and drawings) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.     The drawings are being provided as .DWG and .PDF files.     Drawings can be viewed from Autodesk.     Bidders are responsible for producing their own print sets for their use.       

Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.     At minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: 

1.       Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Company's CCR Point of Contact, 
2.       Your Company's DUNS Number (800-333-0505 if you do not have one) or CAGE Code 
3.       Your Company?s Tax ID Number, 
4.       Your Telephone Number, and 
5.       Your E-Mail Address.     

Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.

Your CCR registration should take approximately 48 hours for processing and activation.     Once you have registered with CCR you may then register with FEDTeDS to view solicitations.     No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.     You may register with FEDTeDS via the following URL https://www.fedteds.gov/.     If you have not used the site previously, please go to "Register with FedTeds" and read the Vendor User Guide.     The official planholders list will be based on only those requesting specifications through FedTeDS. 

There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on or about, February 15, 2005, at 10:00 a.m., local time, in room N133 of the Richard Bolling Federal Building, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri.     Proposals will be received on Tuesday, March 1, 2005, at 2:00 p.m., local time.     Specific location is specified in the RFTP.     Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.     The Government will evaluate submissions to establish those within a competitive range.

Prior to award of contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.     Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.

The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.     All responsible sources not limited by the restrictions stated in the first paragraph may submit an offer, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.     Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.     FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.     

The RFTP specification and Construction Documents are available ONLY by link via this announcement.     The list of planholders will be based only on those requesting the Proposal Documents via FEDTeDS (see above) through the link contained in this announcement.     Those requesting drawings, plans, and/or specifications must first register at www.ccr.gov.

The Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council and the 11th Contracting  Squadron intend to award competitively at least five (5) contracts to small  businesses for a base period of four (4) years with two 3-year option periods.   Small disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, women-owned small business, service- disabled veteran-owned small businesses, veteran-owned small business, and HUB  Zone firms are encouraged to participate in this acquisition.  The Air Force  reserves the right to award fewer contracts if fewer viable proposals are  received.  These contracts are intended to be firm fixed price ID/IQs with an  economic price adjustment.  Air Force contracting offices serving individual  MTFs throughout the contiguous United States will place orders against these  contracts by competing their specific requirements amongst the ID/IQ awardees.   The Air Force currently has 63 MTFs in 58 geographic locations within the  contiguous United States.  The contractors will then be required to recruit,  qualify and retain clinical support service professionals to provide personal  services within the MTFs.  Positions to be filled can include physicians,  nurses, and technicians, to include specialists as needed by the ordering MTF  in accomplishing its routine mission.  The NAICS Code for this acquisition is  621111.  The small business size standard is $8,500,000.00.  The projected  maximum not-to-exceed value for each ID/IQ contract is $1.9 billion over the  potential 10-year life of the contract.  The release of the draft RFP is  projected for 1 April 2005.  All inquiries regarding this acquisition should be  directed to Mr. Joe Boudreau, Joseph.Boudreau@wpafb.af.mil, or Ms. Clarinda  Smith, Clarinda.Smith@wpafb.af.mil.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to develop realistic structural fire search augmented reality simulation training for the Louis F. Garland Fire Academy, located at Goodfellow Air Force Base, TX.  Goodfellow Air Force Base is located in Tom Green County, on the southeast side of San Angelo, TX and is bounded to the north by Highway #388 (Paint Rock Rd), to the west by Fort McKavitt Rd and Bell St/Christoval Rd, to the south by Highway #1223 (San Antonio Hwy) and to the east by the eastern city limits. Work location is at the Louis F. Garland Fire Academy, Bldg 3453.

Develop a high fidelity augmented reality system providing realistic, three-dimensional images of a two-story search trainer under smoke and fire conditions.  The training model should be able to produce computer-generated hazards superimposed onto, and also anchored to, the real world.  The simulation should also include sound inputs consistent with the computer-generated hazards.

Software should be such that it provides the user with the ability to modify inputs with regards to the degree of fire, smoke, and the subsequent effect on the visibility the student has.  The user should be able to determine locations of simulated fires and smoke and these simulations should be anchored into the real world picture seen by the student.

The system should modify the standard self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) mask to be outfitted with an augmented reality (AR) display.  This modified SCBA mask with AR display must be able to communicate with the AR system via wireless communications.  This will allow the students to move around within the trainer with their partners with no hindrance.  The system will be run by an instructor/operator station to set up, control, and modify individual and team training scenarios in the search trainer.

The system will primarily provide AR support to two objectives. The first objective requires that the students, while wearing PPE and SCBA and observing all safety precautions, perform primary search procedures as a team member removing two victims from the structure, within 30 minutes, with at least 25 of 26 evaluation elements performed correctly.  The second objective requires that the students, while wearing PPE and SCBA and observing all safety precautions, perform disoriented fire fighter procedures as a team member and exit the structure within 10 minutes, with at least 7 out of 8 evaluation elements performed correctly.

The AR system should be flexible enough that the software can be modified to use the system in other rooms and allow for the use of other hazards to include chemical spills, biological contamination, nuclear/radiological accidents, and poison gas.

Contractor shall work mutually with the 312th TRS and 17th Training Support Squadron (TRSS) during implementation and testing, and provide technical support to the 17 TRSS for maintenance and upkeep of the simulation.  Contractor shall provide technical support during all phases of the project.

At this time, no solicitation exists: therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION. Be advised that funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government’s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), Information Technology Services (ITS) intends to negotiate and award a sole source, fixed price contract utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, which will be awarded to Fishnet Security Systems of Kansas City, MO for renewal of maintenance and support for the Nokia firewall appliances and associated Checkpoint and Firemon software subscriptions and support.  
 
The USDA requirement is for a single point of support of firewalls in the ITS Web Farm, which are key components critical to the mission of the Service Center Agencies.  Failure to have support for all firewall components from a single vendor will put the web farms at risk by not allowing for a single party to be responsible for all problems.  Fishnet Security, as the maker of the proprietary software, Firemon, is in a unique position to provide the integrated support of all three components (Nokia, Checkpoint, and Firemon).  Due to the proprietary nature of Firemon, no other vendor can provide support on all three components.  

Using multiple vendors has proven unsatisfactory in the past.  The additional time that would be needed for multiple vendors to troubleshoot a problem would put the mission critical applications hosted in the web farm at greater risk.  Purchasing support from another vendor would not be cost or time effective.  
  
The period of performance for this requirement will be April 1, 2005 through March 31, 2006.  
  
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6, and the test program outlined in FAR 13.3, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  This non-competitive action will be awarded under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).  

The solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 26. NAICS code is 541519.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  Responsible sources who are interested in this procurement may respond by providing clear and convincing information that identifies their capabilities to provide support for all three components.  

Payment for these services will be made monthly, IN ARREARS.  Inquiries will only be accepted by email to the contact person listed above.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), Information Technology Services (ITS) intends to negotiate and award a sole source, fixed price contract utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, which will be awarded to Power Management Systems and Sales of Denver, CO as a follow-on contract for continuation of rental of critical UPS and Portable Diesel Generator (Genset) for EMC Storage Devices for the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) infrastructure, web farm, and the Common Computing Environment (CCE) servers located in the computer room at the Natural Resources Research Center (NRRC), 2150 Centre Avenue, Bldg A, Fort Collins, Colorado.  
  
The current requirement is for an additional generator, ups and power distribution unit (PDU) to provide addition backup of power and ups protection to over 400 computer servers located in the NRRC computer room.  Due to the increased need for more servers in the ITS infrastructure and the web hosting facility to support ever increasing department and agency applications, the existing generator and ups system is at 80-percent-plus capacity and is unable to provide adequate backup power for critical USDA and agency applications that reside in the web hosting facility and on ITS infrastructure servers.  

It is vital that the 400-plus servers that currently house applications that are critical to the day-to-day operations of the USDA, NRCS and ITS infrastructure not be disturbed.  It is critical that these systems not be shut down for any length of time.  The addition of a new rental genset, ups and PDU would necessitate the total shut down of these critical agency and departmental systems while the new system was brought online.
The original requirement was competed by GSA when the building was constructed five years ago, and competitively awarded to Power Management Systems and Sales (PMSS).  PMSS is the original provider of the existing generator and ups system for the building, and therefore has the institutional knowledge to understand and support the requirements of the current systems that are being housed and hosted in the NRRC computer room.
Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  To add another vendor’s generator and UPS would incur additional installation and set up costs that include running new cables from the generator to the computer room and the installation of a power transfer switch that would require modifications to the main building electrical room, resulting in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.  

The period of performance for this requirement will be date of award through October 31, 2005.  

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6, and the test program outlined in FAR 13.3, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

Heavy Engineering Repair & Construction (HERC) Acquisition
Request for Information (RFI) #1
Solicitation Number FA8903-05-R-8218
25 March 2005



This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Input into the acquisition strategy is encouraged and welcomed. 


PURPOSE/GENERAL INFORMATION.  The purpose of this RFI is to solicit industry comments on an intended solicitation entitled Heavy Engineering Repair & Construction (HERC).  These will be multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts using NAICS Codes 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The small business size standard associated with this NAICS code is $28.5M.  We anticipate approximately 6-10 awards with a total estimated program ceiling of approximately $4 billion (with a potential to increase by 250%).  At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either firm-fixed priced, cost plus fixed fee, or cost plus incentive fee orders, depending on the nature of the task order requirement.  Additionally, we anticipate that each HERC contract will have an ordering period of five (5) years plus an additional three (3) years to complete contracted work for a total possible period of performance of eight (8) years.  Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts. 

BACKGROUND.  The HERC contracts represent the next major source selection in a series of contract vehicles that the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE) will use to meet the long term requirements of the Air Force, the Department of Defense (DoD), and other federal agencies.  Current contractual programs address environmental restoration, military family housing, and construction workload.  The Design-Build-Plus 03 (DBPO3) contractual program joins aspects of design-bid-build and design-build with architectural/engineering professional services, primarily for work associated with military family housing.  The Worldwide Environmental Restoration and Construction (WERC) contractual program covers requirements for environmental restoration and construction at sites located on DoD installations worldwide, as well as any other sites for which AFCEE customers have responsibilities.  

PROGRAM INFORMATION.  The HERC contractual program will meet AFCEE customer requirements for heavy industrial and commercial construction worldwide, including locations in remote, austere, and contingency environments.  We are in the process of determining the most effective construction concepts to be used on HERC.  Some possibilities include traditional design-bid-build, design-build, design-build-plus, and Conceptual Work Plan/Implementation Work Plan (CWP/IWP).

 We would greatly appreciate your feedback on the following questions.  

1.	What is your degree of relevant experience in providing the full range of CONUS and OCONUS heavy construction, repair, and engineering?
2.	Because we anticipate focusing the task orders under HERC on large, industrial construction projects, we are considering a minimum dollar amount for each order.  What would you consider to be an appropriate minimum dollar amount for each order - $3M, $5M, etc? Please provide your input on this strategy.
3.	What is the minimum and maximum dollar value project on which your firm would routinely consider submitting a proposal?
4.	What is your bonding capacity for construction work?
5.	What is your business size?  If you are a small business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories (small disadvantaged business, woman owned small business, HUB zone small business, service disabled veteran owned small business, and HBCU/MI)? 
6.	 If you are a small business, would you consider submitting a proposal as a prime contractor?
7.	For this type of work, what are your actual percentages and dollars in subcontracting to small business and all sub-categories (small disadvantaged business, woman owned small business, HUB zone small business, service disabled veteran owned small business, and HBCU/MI)?
8.	In what socio-economic programs do you now participate (e.g. Mentor Protégé, Indian Incentive, etc.)?  What is the extent of your participation in these programs?
9.	What are the most critical criteria that would distinguish one company’s capabilities from another?  Explain.
10.	Would you participate in this acquisition with other firms as team members or joint ventures?  What other teaming opportunities do you see for this acquisition?
11.	How do you see the evaluation of team members being conducted?
12.	Based on information provided in the summary above, which contract process would be most effective in accomplishing heavy construction efforts, traditional construction, design-build or some other process?  Explain.  
13.	Will your firm participate in construction activities in high-risk environments such as Iraq?
14.	What are your thoughts on the planned contract length?
15.	We are planning to host a Pre-Solicitation Conference to facilitate feedback on the draft RFP.  What format do you think would be most beneficial?  What topics would you like to hear discussed?
16.	We are planning to host a Pre-Proposal School prior to final RFP release.  If we do, there would be limited seating at the school.  What number of people do you anticipate sending from your organization?  What is the minimum number of personnel required from your firm for the school to be useful to you?
17.	Do you have any other comments or suggestions that you would like to tell us?


Please submit your feedback and company information by 4/13/05 to the following email address: afcee.herc@brooks.af.mil 

A database will be available for you to submit questions and comments concerning the proposed strategy and should be available on the HERC website listed below beginning 3/30/05.  Please refrain from submitting questions or comments any other way.

For further information, please visit the AFCEE website for the HERC requirement, located at http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/HERC/default.asp?CID=67&folde=HERC .

Please note that official information concerning this acquisition will be provided only by the Contracting Officer or the Buyer.  Any information received from other sources should not be relied upon as official acquisition information.

<DESC>Market Survey for Booby Trap Simulator 	The US Army, TACOM, Picatinny Center for Contracting and Commerce,  Picatinny, NJ, is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources for  the manufacture, inspection, testing, and delivery of a booby trap training  simulator. This booby trap simulator will replace the current M117 Booby Trap  Simulator presently used and being built under a US Army Technical Data  Package. The intent of this survey is to see if any legitimate pyrotechnic  manufacturer has an item that will satisfy the requirements for the M117  without requiring the US Army to spend any development costs to modify, test,  and safety certify the item or incur any additional costs based on the service  requirements or legal requirements before the end item is bought and fielded. 	Any design considered as a possible replacement will have to meet the  requirements of a government performance specification. This specification  will include all the testing required, including safety tests, hazard class  tests, sensitivity tests, performance tests, etc. The M117 Booby Trap  Simulator is used to provide training in the installation and use of booby  traps for soldiers and to instill caution and awareness to booby traps set by  opponents during combat maneuvers. Upon ignition, the M117 will signify that  some one has tripped a bobby trap and has been incapacitated by producing a  visible flash and bang. 	Prior acquisition for the M117 utilized a design consisting of the  following: 		1. A cardboard inner tube holding the flash/bang powder. 		2. A cardboard outer tube holding the ignition system.  		3. A string actuator used to energize the initial step in the                    explosive train. 		4. Hardware to mount the simulator to a tree or vertical                    support and a trip wire for ignition.

Noise Hazards: When functioned, the noise level shall be at least           115 db when the simulator is mounted on a vertical surface and the             sound recording device is placed 25 ± 5 feet in the direction of the            wind. It is desired that the maximum sound level be below 140 db. 	5. Ignition: The simulator can be ignited by trip wire or electronic             means within 25 feet from the item.  If electronically initiated,            it must be Electromagnetic Environmental Effects (E3) Certified. 	6. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD): The simulator shall be safe to            handle, pick up, and transport by EOD personnel after application of            an EOD render safe procedure(s) or after one third (1/3) of an hour            wait. 	7. Safety Device: The simulator shall have a positive safety device to           prevent accidental ignition. This device will be removed just prior           to final set up and will cause the simulator to be armed when           removed.  	8. Environmental Tests: The packaged simulators shall pass all the            packaging tests outlined in MIL-STD-1905, Level B. 	9. Item Identification: The manufactured simulators shall be identified            by lot numbering as detailed in MIL-STD-1168. 	10. Final Hazard Classification: The packaged simulators shall comply            with the following hazard classification when packaged and shipped              in commercial or military packaging:                         DOD Hazard Class/Div/SCG     1.3 G 	The pertinent hazard classification tests shall be as detailed in TB         700-2, Department of Defense Ammunition and Explosives Hazard         Classification Procedures. Other tests to be performed are Auto         Ignition Temperature and Electrostatic Tests per MIL-STD-1751, and         Explosion Temperature Test per MIL-STD-650.         11. Insensitive Munitions requirements. If the contractor has             any data based on the insensitive munitions requirements, the data             should be submitted as part of the package. 	12. Operationally, the item is used as a single unit mounted on a              vertical surface and should not be bundled in any type of dispenser.

<CONTACT>linda.naeko.oshiro, 808-438-8572
<DESC>The Government intends to award a sole source with Automated Logic Corporation for Direct Digital Control System (DDC).  Automated Logic Corporations system consists of network servers that allow access for monitoring, reprogramming and adjustment o f control set-points and this system is currently included in Central Plant 3 which is a part of the chilled water system supporting the Quads I, J, K redevelopment.  DDC systems for both Central Plants 1 and 2 are the Automated Logic System.  The DDC will  be the third network server and this server would control the equipment within the plant and serve as back-up to the main server in the event of failure of the network servers in Central Plants 1 and 2.  DDC is recommended for Central Plant 3 for the foll owing reasons:  (1) DDC system installed in Central Plants 1 and 2 are the Automated Logic systems; (2) the workstations in Central Plants 1 and 2 require additional graphics and reprogramming to read equipment sensors in the new buildings to be constructe d in Phase 2E.  These workstations software is proprietary to Automated Logic Corporation and is not interchangeable with other manufacturers software; (3) DDC system for Central Plant 3 must take over the functions of the main network server in the even t the main server at Central Plant 1 fails.  A third-party system would not be completely compatible with the servers in Central Plants 1 and 2 since the internal software in the Automated Logic system is propriety; (4) Training of the users staff will be come more costly.  Operators will be required to understand the programming and features of two separate systems; (5) Replacement parts and maintenance will become costly, since different vendors will be required for servicing and maintaining two differing  systems; and (6) the required product is only available from the original source for the continued provision of specialized services.  An award to another source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to b e recovered through competition.  It should be noted that the initial two systems, which are Automated Logic Corporations Direct Digital Control systems, are protected proprietary systems of limited availability.  Any interested contractors shall respond by May 10, 2005.  See Note 22.

<SUBJECT>R -- Notice of Intent to Procure on a Sole Source Basis
<DESC>Notice of Intent to procure on a Sole Source Basis with MORI-KO, for estimation of mean length at age and fishery rates for Chinook Technical Committee model.  The U.S. Commissioners of the Pacific Salmon Commission signed a Letter of Agreement (LOA) in June, 1996 that established a new abundance based management (ABM) approach for managing the chinook fishery in Southeast Alaska.  The LOA included assignments of new data collection and analysis tasks to the Pacific Salmon Commission’s Chinook Technical Committee (CTC).  The U.S. Commissioners recommended to Congress that the funding required to carry out these tasks be provided to (PSC) state and tribal fishery managers.  

The U.S. PSC Commissioners annually invite fishery management agencies, tribal management groups and contractors with specific analytical skills to submit proposals for funding that would provide new information required for chinook (ABM) management implementation.  They also directed the U.S. CTC to intensively review these proposals to determine if they met ABM needs and are technically sound.  The CTC has identified a critical need for information regarding the estimation of length at age and fishery harvest rate for use in their Chinook Model and have recommended that MORI-KO, LLC be awarded a contact to conduct this work.  Based on the U.S. CTC and U.S. PSC Commissioner’s recommendations, MORI-KO, LLC should be the sole source contractor for this study.  The Principle Investigators available to MORI-KO to conduct this work have extensive experience in the construction and development of the CTC Chinook Model dating back to its inception.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment, 0001, is to respond to questions from prospective offerors with regards to the combined synopsis/solicitation posted on March 4, 2005.


QUESTION 1:

Where is the mention of lens options?

ANSWER 1:

Optional lens will not be purchased under this requirement.

QUESTION 2:

What is the proposed flight height?

ANSWER 2:

Reference Item 14 in the Specifications, Attachment No. 1

QUESTIONS 3:

What is the proposed resolution (GSD) requirements:

ANSWER 3:

The required GSD is not specified because it will come out of the specified camera resolution, lens chosen for the particular survey, and aircraft altitude.  This is the reason for the 4kx4k (medium format) minimum pixel and 2.5 second cycle time camera specification.  This will support stereo operations at most of our altitudes and aircraft speeds, and reasonable GSDs given the other trade-offs.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 4 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR RECHARGEABLE BATTERY AND INTEGRATED CHARGER FOR THE WIRELESS INSTRUMENTATION SYSTEM ON INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to:  1 - Extend the due date of proposals to April 1, 2005, to allow for the resolution of questions which have arisen internally.  If amendments to the SOW are necessary, they will be posted accordingly. 2 - Expand upon Mod 2, when answering the following question: "Para. 2.3 of the SOW defines a schedule of 16 weeks from contract award to delivery of flight units.  The flight units are required to meet all the specifications for present onboard systems. This time interval appears very restrictive unless a present design already exists.  Does NASA feel that this is a correct time span for delivery of the flight units given the space qualified parts may take up to one year to be available?".   NASA’s response is as follows: Clarification; the units are required to meet the requirements of the RFP, which makes accommodations for use of commercial parts.  Accordingly, NASA feels that the schedule required is a proper time span for delivery of the units.  To aid offerors in the understanding of ratings the follow is provided from NSTS 22206 document, Criticality Ratings are defined as follows:  FUNCTIONAL CRITICALITY DEFINITIONS FOR FLIGHT HARDWARE Criticality Potential Effect or Failure 1)    Single failure which could result in loss of life or vehicle. 1R)    Redundant hardware item(s), all of which if failed, could cause loss of life or vehicle. 2)     Single failure which could result in loss of mission. 2R)    Redundant hardware item(s), all of which if failed, could cause loss of mission. 3)     All others. By default, this means Criticality 3 hardware failure does not cause a loss of mission impact. The due date for receipt of offers is extended to April 1, 2005. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 3/4/2005. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.
