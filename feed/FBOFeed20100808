(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or
division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in
performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation

responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its
intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of
subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the
responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient
documentation to support the legally changed name.
(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this
clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the
absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information
that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be
considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment"
paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.
(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual
payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment
of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in
the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments,
including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be
considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment"
paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
 	(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual
confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423

that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that
the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor
believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of
the Contractor."
(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
(e) For Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the Contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request. For
Contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide
the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
(f) The Contracting Officer's decision shall be final unless the contractor appeals or files a suit as provided in the Act.
(g) If the claim by the Contractor is submitted to the Contracting Officer or a claim by the
Government is presented to the Contractor, the parties, by mutual consent, may agree to use
alternative dispute resolution (ADR). If the Contractor refuses an offer for ADR, the Contractor
shall inform the Contracting Officer, in writing, of the Contractor's specific reasons for rejecting
the offer.
(h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that
payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to
claims having defective certifications, as defined in (FAR) 48 CFR 33.201, interest shall be paid
from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim. Simple interest on claims
shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury as provided in the ACT, which is
applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the
rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency
of the claim.
(i) The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Contracting Officer.
