<DESC>NA INDEFINITE DELIVERY / INDEFINITE QUANTITY (IDIQ) SOLUTION ORDER CONCEPT MULTIPLE AWARD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT (MACC) for the following Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) locatd at Fort Gordon, GA; Fort Campbell, KY; Fort Stewart, GA; Fort Jackson, SC; Fort Rucker, AL; Fort Benning, GA; Redstone, AL; and Fort McPherson, GA.  This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside for those contractors servicing the southeast United States which have a NAICS Code Sector 233, 234, and 235. All other firms are deemed ineligible  to submit offers.  This solicitation will result in the award of three to five contracts to small business contractors who provide the most advantageous, responsive and responsible proposal resulting in the best value to the government, price and other factors considered. It  is the intention of this acquisition to procure renovation, alteration, repair, construction and build solution capability by means of an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Solution Order Concept Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC). This acquisition is for a base year of twelve months for a maximum value of $10 million. The contract contains two twelve-month options for a total maximum duration of thirty-six months or a value of $30 million whichever comes first.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to approximately three to five offerors based on factors that include: Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management & Organization, Scheduling. Phase I factors relate to the base year and tw o option year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including administrative, training, hospital, clinic, and community support type facilities, not just the seed project identified in the RFP. Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II. In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit additional information on Factor B (Technical/Management) and price proposals for a “seed” project, which has been identified as Replace Air Handling Units (AHU) at Bldg 9200, 3, 5, 6 & 13 floors at Martin Army Community Hospital at Fort Benning, GA.  The estimated price range for the seed project is $250,000 - $500,000.  The Government may choose to award the seed project based on initial proposals wit hout holding discussions. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any one or all proposers; to award the seed project to other than the proposer submitting the lowest total price; and t o award contracts to the three to five proposers submitting proposals determined by the Source Selection Authority to be the most advantageous, best value, to the Government. Price proposals will include total evaluated price (price of seed project plus mo dification markups). The best value proposal for the seed project will be awarded the seed project and an IDIQ construction contract for the base year. The subsequent contracts will be awarded at the same time with a minimum guarantee of $10,000.  After pr oposal revisions (if necessary) are received, a best value award decision will be made based on the individual seed project. The selected firms will be requested to submit technical and price proposals for the seed project. Offerors who fail to submit tech nical and price proposals in Phase II for the seed project will not be considered for an award. The Government will award the seed project based on the most advantageous combination of price and technical factors that result in the overall best value award  to the Government. If discussions are required, they will be conducted with each offeror in the competitive range. At the conclusion of discussions, each offeror in the competitive range will be given an opportunity to submit a proposal revision. Price an d overall technical rating are of equal significance for the best value awards.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSIO N OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Phase II proposals will be requested from approximately three to five offerors who submitted proposals during Phase I which are determined to be the most highly qualified. Offerors should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions to provide an opportunity for the offeror to revise  its proposal.  FOLLOW-ON WORK AFTER AWARD; All contractors awarded an IDIQ Contract will compete on subsequent task orders that may be scoped by the Government/Contractor team and may not have traditional plans & specs, but may include sketches and requests for catalog c uts and other submittals.  Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value trade-off continuum or low price. If the Government decides to iss ue the task order as a best value, award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order. Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserv es the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.  There will be no paper copies of this solicitation; all interested parties must access the Army’s Single Face Initiative FedBizOps website at http://acquisition.army.mil/default.htm.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated to Viable Information Processing Systems (VIPs) of Towson, MD.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to obtain a perpetual national license for the VIPS SuperOp software tool.  CMS plans to include SuperOp in the Fiscal Intermediary Standard System (FISS) and make it available for all FIs.  CMS will also have the option of using SuperOp for other programs as well.  VIPs is the only known source that owns the proprietary software license to offer for sale to CMS for the purchase of the SuperOp software tool.  

SuperOp interfaces with existing systems in order to streamline the processing of health care claim and encounter records by maximizing the level of automation employed in applying edits--policy and processing rules--to electronic records during adjudication.  Generally, products like SuperOp have been referred to as 'Expert [claim processing] Systems.'  The functions and benefits which SuperOp include are: interception and prevention of online claims errors by replicating the steps examiners go through when resolving such errors; reductions in the number of claims that suspend for manual resolution from batch processing; correction of inconsistent or incorrect bills (minimizing rejections back to providers); application of medical and utilization review guidelines and resolution of third party liability and coordination of benefit errors among other automation of complicated  benefit and payment rules; follow-through on suspected or confirmed fraud and abuse situations; creation of an audit trail that remains in history providing the ability to track all edits; and, the use of pre-determined criteria to recognize errors and the comparison of data elements to 'decide' how claims should be processed resulting in the ability to take action to resolve errors.  Key to the ability of SuperOp to perform these functions is a user-maintained file of 'events'--logical statements that tell claims processing systems how to recognize a problematic condition, and how to resolve that condition.  Currently several medicare contractors have SuperOp as their product of choice.

This is NOT a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  Firms that believe they can provide a more efficient and cost effective software tool to perform the functions listed in the previous paragraphs, should identify themselves, their interest, the capability of the tool, and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the publication date of this synopsis.    A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed action  is solely within the discretion of the Government.    Inquiries may be sent to Cathy Baldwin, Contract Specialist, (410)786-5791, or Linda Hook, Contracting Officer, 410-786-8371.

<CONTACT>John Lippe, (405) 954-7833
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes to acquire by the use of single source procedures, the continued services for engineering and technical support services, now being provided by Computer Systems Designers, LLC., (CSD) 500 N. Meridian Avenue, Suite 100L, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73107.  Award of the follow-on contract, a labor-hour/time and materials type contract, is contemplated on or about September 11, 2002.  A bilateral modification of contract DTFA-02-97-D-97511 will provide for an interim two-month contract, with a one-month option period, while an award is made under a competitive 8(a) set-aside.  Cost for the first two-month’s performance is estimated at $280,000, with the three-month total estimated at $420,000. <P> This acquisition is in support of the Federal Aviation Administration Logistics Center’s (FAALC) Product Services Division, which provides direct support to the FAA National Airspace System (NAS) field offices.  These field offices provide day-to-day support, for various NAS systems, critical to the required maintenance of the system, which directly impacts the safety of the flying public. <P> The acquisition of these interim services will enable the contractor, CSD, whose contract expires July 11, 2002, to continue work for a two-month period, with an additional one-month renewal period if needed, while a new contract is awarded.  The option month is included to cover any unforeseen delays, which would preclude the new contract from being awarded by September 11, 2002.  CSD has been performing these services for the past five years.  It would be neither cost effective nor technically practical to obtain a new contractor for two months of service.  The loss of the services of CSD would interrupt the Logistic Center’s engineering and technical support to NAS field offices.  Failure to provide these services may cause some NAS systems to shut down, leaving air traffic control without essential systems that may result in potential danger to the flying public.  CSD is the only source capable of performing these services in the time required. <P>

<DESC>NA 1.0  INTRODUCTION.  The Defense Contracting Command Washington, on the behalf of the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), in concert with the Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to acquire Information Support Services for the recompete of the Defen se System Intergration, Design, Development, Operation and Maintenance Support (D/SIDDOMS).   In order to accomplish this effort the following types of services, equipment, materials, and facilities will be required to design, develop, procure, integrate, test, train, deploy, operate, and maintain Military Health System (MHS) systems and system components and similar programs for other federal agencies with a health care mission.  This contract includes services necessary for the contractor to manage its ow n staff, resources, products, and schedules in performing work, but specifically excludes any services to support the MHS in planning or managing MHS programs or offices. 1.1.   EXTERNAL FEDERAL AGENCY USAGE.  In addition to the mission of the TRICARE Management Activity, this contract may be used to acquire services within the scope of the statement of work for other DOD and non-DOD agencies with a health care mission at t he discretion of the Acquisition Management Division (AMD) and the Defense Contracting Command – Washington (DCC-W). 1.2.   BACKGROUND. The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is responsible for the operation of TRICARE as the worldwide, integrated system for accessible, high quality and cost effective delivery of health care services to Department of Defense (DoD) benefic iaries during peacetime and wartime.  The MHS provides medical support for the full range of military deployments and peacetime support to members of the Armed Forces, their families, and others to advance our national security interests. The mission of th e MHS is to provide and to maintain readiness, and to provide healthcare services and support to members of the Armed Forces during military operations.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs)/TRICARE Management Activity (OASD (HA)/TMA) has a requirement to provide support to the MHS in applying the principles of DoD information and technology management by developing and implemen ting policies, procedures, programs, and technical standards necessary to acquire, manage, integrate, and secure information technology systems and capabilities that support the delivery of high quality, cost effective health care services across the opera tional continuum.  The TMA/DCC-W D/SIDDOMS III contract will be a tool used to support TMA in the execution of its vast mission. The MHS provides comprehensive healthcare for all Armed Forces personnel, their families, and other individuals eligible for care.  The MHS Information Management/Information Technology (IM/IT) Program supports the MHS by closely aligning its priorities an d processes with the MHS mission, vision, goals, and strategies.  The MHS IM/IT Program continues to evolve through the development of capabilities in the following six functionally integrated programs:  The Clinical Information Technology Program Office (CITPO),  The Defense Medical Logistics System Support (DMLSS) Program Office,  The Resources Information Technology Program Office (RITPO),  The Executive Information/Decision Support (EI/DS) Program Office,  The Theater Medical Information Program Office (TMIP), and  The Technology Infrastructure Management Program Office (TIMPO). It is through these areas that the MHS IM/IT Program will fully integrate its information systems to support the MHS goals and strategies in support of readiness, TRICARE, and preventive healthcare initiatives.  It continues to move toward its goal of cons olidating over 100 legacy systems into a single migration system to support each of these functional areas. The integrated program structure ensures full integration of the MHS into the defense information infrastructure and full compliance with the te chnical standards of the common operating environment.  The MHS IM/IT Program has made substantial progress in its delivery of real-time information through the adaptation of emerging technologies and reengineering initiatives. 2.0  CONFLICT OF INTEREST.  Contractors currently providing program management or requirements definition activities to the TMA, through any contract vehicle (PMI, TMA BPA ,GSA schedules, etc.) are precluded from bidding on this contract. 2.1.   SUPPORT CONTRACTORS.  Booz Allen Hamilton and LEADS Corporation staff have signed confidentiality agreements and are bound by the same rules as the Government staff assigned to this procurement.  They will facilitate group discussions, manage the co mpilation of scores, and assist in development of reports and briefings. Booz Allen Hamilton and LEADS Corporation will not be competing for this contract or any delivery/task orders to be awarded against this contract. 3.0  SMALL BUSINESSES.  The Government intends to award, at a minimum, at least three awards to the most highly qualified offerors who have to been determined to be a small business.  The Government further reserves the right to set aside 15% of the total contract value to be made available for fair opportunities to small businesses for post award delivery/task order issuance.  3.1.   TEAMING AGREEMENTS.  Contractors are encouraged to team with other contractors to provide the Government the best value for completing work under this ID/IQ contract, however no prime contractor or subcontractor maybe included in more than one contr act award, for the purposes of excluding any possibility of an Organizational Conflict of Interest. 3.2.   ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI).  Once a vendor has elected to enter into a teaming agreement with another vendor they are bound by the same OCI clause, whether they are serving as the prime contractor or a subcontractor. 4.0  CONTRACT TYPE.

Ultimately, the collection and analysis of these data, when combined with other information, will enable NHTSA to improve the types of countermeasures developed for reducing the occurrence of injury producing crashes.

The contractor shall prepare and implement a data collection and analysis plan for obtaining survey data from up to 2,000 motorcyclists in the general rider population. Unless a suitable alternative approach can be developed for collecting the data, Office of Management and Budget approval shall be sought and obtained prior to initiating the survey.  At a minimum, data will be collected at events and locations where motorcyclists congregate and can be observed riding.  A technical report suitable for publication shall be prepared that provides insight into the characteristics, behaviors, and experiences of riders who are, and are not, crash involved.  The report shall focus on motorcyclists age 40 years and older and comparisons will be made for those over and under 40 years of age.  A major challenge is to collect clusters of related data that may be useful for countermeasures development.  

The contractor will be required to demonstrate substantial knowledge of motorcycling and motorcycle-safety issues as well as successful field data-collection expertise specifically related to motorcyclist behaviors.  Additionally, the contractor will need to demonstrate expertise in field data analysis.  Those contractors not meeting these requirements will not be considered.

A cost reimbursable type contract is anticipated with a period of performance of 18 months.  Electronic copies of this solicitation will be available on the GSA's Electronic Posting Systems (EPS), located on the Internet at http://www.esp.gov  or www.fedbisopps.gov . It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet sites for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading and printing their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Requests for paper copies will not be accepted.  The anticipated issuance date is May 31, 2002.

<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the Department of Commerce to acquire a High Resolution X-Ray Diffraction System from Philips Analytical, 12 Michigan Drive, Natick, MA  01760.  A high resolution X-ray diffractometer for compound semiconductors is a specialized piece of equipment for analysis of epitaxial thin films and their closely lattice matched substrates.  An intense, highly collimated X-ray beam is used to probe a specimen.  The Optoeletronics Division of NIST has several ongoing programs requiring high-resolution X-ray diffraction studies of compound semiconductors. Each of these studies requires a different configuration of the high resolution X-ray diffractometer.  Therefore, the instrument NIST buys will be required to operate in a wide variety of modes, including line focus and spot focus, with numerous X-ray optics for each.  In addition, it will be necessary to switch frequently from one mode to another, in order to accommodate all the programs requiring the instrument.  Hence, the instrument must allow for reconfiguration with little time necessary to change the X-ray source, change the X-ray optics, and realign the system after each change.   Philips Analytical is the only known vendor, who has developed a unique instrument that exceeds the typical "X-ray diffractometers" to perform a wide array of measurements on compound semiconductors with minimal time required for changing the instrument configuration.  Philips Analytical has the only high resolution X-Ray Diffraction System with the following specific features required by NIST:  1) A single X-ray tube source which can be converted from line focus to point focus (or point focus to line focus) with reconfiguration of the X-ray source and optics being achievable in a short time (nominally 15 minutes or less).  2) X-ray optics for high resolution X-ray rocking curves, X-ray reflectivity, triple crystal reciprocal space maps, and rocking curves from small samples with spatial resolution of 1 mm2 or smaller.  Interchanging the optics for different measurement modes will leave the system aligned to within 1 micron. 3) Hybrid x-ray optic with parabolic mirror and integral monochromator.  This acquisition is for a commercial item for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested concerns must submit a written qualification statement that clearly establishes the firm's capability to meet the above requirements.  This qualification statement shall be submitted to the individual and office cited above within 15 days from the date this synopsis is posted on the Internet.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received with 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), is soliciting proposals on a Total Small Business Set-Aside basis under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541512 - $18 million (formerly used Code 541611 - $5 million for Source Synopsis posted on May 16, 2002) for a two year contract for Phase I of the overall integration of DHHS event reporting and patient safety data systems.  It is anticipated that Phases II and III shall be awarded upon the expiration of this contract.

The Secretary of DHHS established a Patient Safety Task Force (PSTF) with the mission to integrate existing data collection on medical errors and adverse events, to coordinate research and analysis efforts, and to collaborate on reducing the occurrence of injuries that result from medical errors.  PSTF brings together AHRQ, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Food and Drug Administration    (FDA) to integrate and coordinate their activities related to patient safety and the reduction of medical errors.  The PSTF contracted with the MEDSTAT Group, Inc. for an implementation planning study which recommended a phased integration process with three distinct phases. This contract shall be for Phase I and shall entail: (1) the development of a web based reporting interface for hospital and institutional-based reporting of events to the CDC and FDA which includes the FDA?s Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS), Biological Product Deviation (BPD), the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and Manufacturer User Device Experience (MAUDE/MedSun) and the CDC?s National Healthcare Safety Network; (2) the development of a coding structure for reporting, (3) the development of a prototype data warehouse and quarry system of event reports, (4) the development of training materials and user-based software for local institutional use,  (5) prototype testing of the reporting system and (6) the development of an integration plan for Phases II and III.  Phase II shall be for the development of an integrated data storage (data warehouse) and analysis system for the four reporting components that will allow agency analysis and feedback to individual hospital or institutionally-based users on demand and the integration of other reporting data systems related to patient safety of the DHHS partners including AHRQ and CMS.  Phase III shall be for the continued expansion of the system adding additional non-DHHS systems such as state departments of health, accrediting entities such as the Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Health Care Organization (JCAHO), the Department of Defense (DoD), Veteran?s Administration (VA) and other national systems including the United Kingdom. The MEDSTAT report shall be provided as an attachment to the solicitation to serve as a guide for the preparation of proposals in response to the solicitation.  
 
Sources must have an understanding of and experience in integrating large health care data bases,  developing web-based user input formats and managing large data warehouses.  Knowledge of the issues and problems associated with the area of patient safety and medical error in health care is also essential.  Sources must also possess, or be able to obtain (in-house or through subcontracting arrangements), the staff and other resources needed to expeditiously carry out the different types of activities listed above.  The estimated issuance data of solicitation AHRQ-02-0005 is July 5, 2002, with the proposal due approximately 35 days thereafter.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will only be available by downloading from the Internet on AHRQ?s Internet site at http://www.ahrq.gov.  It is the offeror?s responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  Since we will not know who isdownloading the solicitation, a bidders list will not be available.  The response date of August 9, 2002 for receipt of proposals is only an approximation.

<DESC>Requests for Proposals (RFP) N01-CN-25026-76, entitled:  Preclinical In Vivo and In Vitro Screening Assays.  The Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP), of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking proposals from qualified organizations who have the ability to screen potential cancer preventive agents in a variety of mechanism-based in vitro and in vivo assays and establish the infrastructures composed of one or more collaborating institutions that will conduct these mechanism-based screening assays.  The assays will assess the potential of various agents to inhibit, reverse, or delay early carcinogenesis by evaluating the effects of these agents on a variety of endpoints, including but not limited to, specific molecular targets, transformation, proliferation, and apoptosis;  and validation of new assays and techniques, such as quantitative image analysis.  For the in vivo tests a required endpoint shall be the histopathologic evaluation of cancers.  The agents to be studied shall include agents developed by the pharmaceutical and other industries and provided to the NCI for collaborative development as well as commercially available agents, agents developed by the NCI, and agents nominated by academic investigators through the RAPID program (http://www.cancer.gov/prevention/rapid/).  The specific goals are to (1) screen and identify potential cancer preventive agents in various mechanism-based in vitro assays relating to molecular targets and the inhibition, reversal, or delay of early carcinogenesis and (2) evaluate further potential cancer preventive agents, that have preliminary supportive data from mechanism-based in vitro assays, in various standardized and newly developed in vivo rodent model systems of experimental carcinogenesis.  Contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation will replace the current In Vitro Master Agreement pool and the current In Vivo Master Agreement pool.  Contracts will be awarded to the offerors who demonstrate the ability to conduct mechanism-based in vitro and in vivo bioassays of potential cancer preventive agents.  Offerors for these contracts must demonstrate that they have knowledge of drug development, preferably in disease prevention, and expertise in cell free, cell culture, and molecular assay techniques and in laboratory animal bioassay methods.  Offerors need to provide evidence of their own expertise and access to expertise in such areas as molecular biology, pathology, imaging, statistical analyses, analytical chemistry, and other potentially relevant laboratory methodologies.   Contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation will be cost-reimbursement completion type, with managed work assignments.   Work Assignments will be initiated by the Project Officer, who will forward a request to the Principal Investigator stating the period of performance, specific work to be performed, and the deliverables.  Within the specified period, the Contract will submit to the Project Officer a detailed description of the technical approach to be used in carrying out the Work Assignment, and an estimate of the required effort and cost.  The cost of a Work Assignment shall not exceed the funds currently allotted to the contract.  With the concurrence of the Project Officer, the Contracting Officer will then execute the Work Assignment.  Offerors will have flexibility to subcontract with additional sites to provide specific technical expertise that is needed for the individual Work Assignments.  The duration of each study will depend on the in vitro assay or the laboratory animal model and will be specified in each Work Assignment.  The contractor selected shall be responsible for providing the chemopreventive agent except in instances when the NCI wants an agent tested that may not be available to the contractor.  In such cases, the Government shall bear the expense of providing an agent.  The specific work assignment shall specify whether the contractor shall be expected to provide the agent.   It is anticipated that six (6) awards will be made and that these contracts will be incrementally-funded with a period of performance of five (5) years.  Offerors must submit a proposal that addresses both task areas, that is, In Vitro and In Vivo Screening Assays.  Only proposals from offerors who demonstrate the capability to perform both In Vitro and In Vivo Screening Assays will be considered for award.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710.  The RFP will be issued ELECTRONICALLY July 3, 2002.  The RFP will be available on the Research Contracts Branch (RCB) web site at: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov Click on "Current Request for Proposals."  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above internet site for the release of this solicitation and amendments, if any.  POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.  Point of Contact: Cynthia D. Washington, Contract Specialist, Prevention, Control and Population Sciences Section (PCPSS), Research Contracts Branch (RCB), NCI, 6120 Executive Boulevard, Room 6002, MSC 7195, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7195.  Phone: (301) 435-3798; fax: (301) 402-8579.  ALL QUESTIONS/INQUIRIES SHALL BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY TO CYNTHIA D. WASHINGTON, CONTRACT SPECIALIST, at cw212f@nih.gov.   All requests for information should reference RFP No. N01-CN-25026-76.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>NA The New York District is seeking to secure a firm fixed-price contract for the design/build of a new Air Freight Terminal/Base Supply Storage Facility, at McGuire AFB, New Jersey.  The Government reserves the right to limit the competitive range to the hig hest rated technical proposals. Additionally, the Government reserves the right to enter into discussions necessary, and if discussions are conducted the offerors will be afforded the opportunity to revise their proposal or the Government may award without  discussions.   This is a design-build project for the design and construction of a modern complex to house a new Air Freight Terminal (AFT) of approximately 5,780 SM and adjoining new Airfield Support (Base Supply) Facility (BS) of approximately 5,226 SM.  The AFT facili ty will be designed and constructed for the safe and orderly movement of palletized cargo and the Base Supply will be built to house high-density storage systems (NIC) for storage of equipment and parts necessary to support the aircraft based at McGuire AF B.  Both facilities contain administrative offices, shops, and special storage areas and/or vaults, as well as other special features.  The project work includes supporting utilities and systems, such as, domestic water supply, sanitary sewers, fire protec tion and detection systems, site improvements, parking areas, pavements, and communications. The new complex will have a reinforced concrete foundation and floor slabs, structural steel high-bay framing, brick exterior and metal facade, and a sloped standi ng seam metal roof.  The existing AFT facility, Bldg 1702, its foundation and appurtenances (building: approx. 98,500 SF, concrete dock/ramps: approx. 29,000 SF, and mechanized material handling system: approx. 13,300 SF) will be raised in its entirety and  the new complex constructed on its site.  The work also involves renovation of approximate 284 SM space in the McGuire AFB Passenger Terminal (Bldg 1706) for a new In-flight Kitchen and the renovation of building 1819 (a building of approximately 1,200 SM ) for use as administration, training and arms storage.

The Corps of Engineers (COE) is responsible for effectively implementing the small business programs within its activities, including achieving program g oals, and ensuring that contracting and technical personnel maintain knowledge of Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women-owned small business program requirements, and taking all reasonable actions to increase participation in its small business activities.  In line with the emphasis on this program, the COE, New York District is particularly desirous of increasing subcontracting opportunities for Small business concerns, Small Disadvantaged business concerns and Women-owned small business concerns. You, as a  prime contractor, are required to participate in this program by soliciting subcontractor bids from such firms. In addition to locating simply small business sources, you are encouraged to take action to locate competent Small Disadvantaged and Women-owne d small business concerns for your subcontracting opportunities in preparing your offer. You are further urged to request such sources in the vicinity in which the work is to be performed. In addition, it is suggested that you contact the local SBA Minorit y Enterprise Development (MED) staff to obtain SBA’s certified listing of socially and economically disadvantaged business concerns in the vicinity in which the work is to be performed. Therefore, the following instructions and provisions apply to this sol icitation:  The successful offeror, if a large business, must submit a subcontracting plan within five (5) working days of notification of selection. The subcontracting plan must be in conformance with all aspects of FAR Subpart 19.7.  A contract will not be awarded unless and until the Contracting Officer has determined (with advice from SBA) that the o fferor’s subcontracting plan provides maximum practicable opportunities for Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-owned Small Business concerns to participate in contract performance. In determining the acceptability of a proposed subcontracting plan the Co ntracting Officer will evaluate all relevant factors inclusive of an offeror’s past performance with respect to the offeror’s having awarded subcontracts for the same or similar products or services to Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-owned small busin ess concerns.  In order to make this evaluation, the offeror is required to submit its past SF 294 (Subcontracting Report For Individual Contracts) and SF 295 (Summary Subcontract Report) forms along with its offer. Subcontracting plans will be evaluated t o ensure compliance with solicitation requirements and the public law.  PRIOR to award, the successful offeror will be required to discuss its subcontracting plan with the Small And Disadvantaged Business Utilization Specialist (the “SADBUS”), the Contract ing Officer, the Source Selection Authority and the SBA.  FAR 19.706, Responsibilities Of The Cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer, at subsection (b) states that “If the contractor does not comply in good faith with the subcontracting plan, the adm inistrative contracting officer shall, upon contract completion, make appropriate recommendations that contracting officers may use for future contracts.”  Therefore, a determination by the contracting officer, during or after completion of the project, th at the contractor did not implement its plan in good faith may result in adverse recommendations with regard to the contractor’s future contract opportunities.  In addition, FAR 52.219-16, Liquidated Damages - Subcontracting Plan, failure to fully implemen t the plan during the life of the project may result in the assessment of liquidated damages.  Direct contracting questions to the Contract Specialist, point of contact for this acquisition is Mr. Gerald Gilliard, telephone (212) 264-0154, or facsimile (212) 264-3013 and technical questions to the technical point of contact for this acquisition who is Mr. Robert Philbrick, telephone (212) 264-9102, or facsimile (212) 264-6494.

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for a bridge contract to Johnson Engineering for continuation of services from their current contract (NAS 9-18800) from January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003 with three 2-month options through June 30, 2004.    The Contractor will continue to perform analytical integration of mission variable equipment and layout for Flight Crew Equipment (FCE), payloads, and other hardware in the Orbiter crew compartment; define, control and document the stowage installation and location of equipment launched in intravehicular (IVA) environments carried within the payload bay of the Space Shuttle in support of ISS missions; produce launch/return cargo configuration and on-orbit stowage planning for ISS missions; produce cargo configurations for NASA cargo launched on Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) and Progress (as required); analyze and develop power, data and video plug-in plans and cable routing diagrams for the on-orbit ISS internal environment and orbiter crew compartment; and produce flight and non-flight decals, placards and graphics. NASA/JSC intends to continue to purchase these services from Johnson Engineering, from January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2003 with three 2-month options through June 30, 2004. The authority cited permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1); Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government does not believe that competing this effort at this time is to its advantage or to industry's advantage, since the period of performance for this extension is only 12 months with three 2-months options which may or may not be exercised, and any cost savings achieved through competition would be diminished and overshadowed by costs, including phase-in costs, and time delays needed to build relationships with both the ISS Program Office and users of the applications and services provided by Johnson Engineering. However, NASA does intend to compete this effort in the near future. This effort will be combined and competed as part of the International Space Station (ISS) Mission Cargo effort resulting in a contract to be awarded by 12/31/03. The ISS Mission Cargo effort is consistent with the ISS Program strategy. The strategy developed to consolidate contracts and offer competition opportunities to those who are interested can be viewed at the following website:  http://jsc-web-pub.jsc.nasa.gov/bd01/excellent-strategy/           The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26. See Note 22. The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about July 19, 2002. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform this effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on July 5, 2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the ONLY solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is 52ABNC200090 and is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  This procurement will be conducted using simplified acquisition procedures under FAR Part 15.  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 97-17.  Any resulting contract from this solicitation will be a firm-fixed price, delivery date is required on or before September 30, 2002; FOB Honolulu, HI.  The North American Industry Classification (NAIC) code is 513340.  The National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) has a requirement for 38 pop-up satellite archival transmitting tags (PSATS) with the following specifications: 1) PSAT tags must be capable of collecting up to 500 days worth of data on ambient temperature, light levels, ambient pressure (i.e., depth), and battery voltage; then download the stored processed, and/or summarized data to the ARGOS system of satellites after jettisoning on a specified date, or at a specified date, or at a specified number of days after deployment.  2) the tag and/or attending software must be able to provide daily times of sunrise and sunset and/or coordinates of longitude and latitude during the period of deployment.  Accuracy should be within 2 degrees of latitude and longitude.  3) Software must be supplied by the manufacturer for downloading, collating and parsing of tag derived data or derived and collated data is to be supplied by the manufacturer.  4) Downloaded pressure (depth) and temperature data from ARGOS must be ultimately provided as individual raw values collected at a rate of acquisition to the user (at the very least, on an hourly basis).  (Data must not be provided as collated summaries over a given time period.  5) The tag and/or attending on-board software must also be capable of measuring, recording and downloading the "attitude" of the tag (animal).  These data are needed to determine whether the tag actually stayed on the animal (i.e., horizontal) until it jettisoned at the programmed date, or whether the animal perished after tagging and the tag was free-floated (i.e., vertical).  6) The tags must be re-programmable after manufacture, such that the onboard software and date the tag is programmed to jettison can be updated.  These programming tasks should be doable by end users, or by the manufacturer at minimal or no cost.  7) Due to adverse and unpredictable conditions, tags must be activated by a simple method (e.g. removal of battery to activate PSAT) whilst in the filed that does not necessitate a computer interface.  8) In order to conserve battery life but also to aid in data throughput, the PSAT should only transmit data when there is a ARGOS satellite footprint encompassing the location of the tag.  9) A fail-safe device that prevents data loss if the animal sinks and the attached tag implodes.  This device would sever the connection before tag implosion, thereby sending the tag transmitter to float to the surface to download data.

The following clauses and provisions are applicable to this acquisition and are incorporated by reference as follows:  FAR Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial applies to this acquisition and there are no addenda to this provision;  Offers shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with offer; FAR clause 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.  The following FAR clauses and provisions are applicable to this acquisition and areadded: 52.203-6, 52.217-6, 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.232-14, 52.232-34, Addendum: 52.214-33, Submission of Offers in the English Language; and 52.214-34, Submission of Offers in US Currency.  Full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) can be accessed on the Internet at www.Arnet.gov/far.  

Evaluation/Selection: Technical quality are considered to be more importance than price.  Technical criteria for evaluation includes the following factors with Factor 1 being more important than Factors 2 & 3 which are of equal importance: 1) Demonstrated ability to meet all nine PSAT tag specifications; 2) Timely delivery of pop-up satellite archival transmitting tags (PSATS) that fully comply with the specifications (Offerors that can deliver the tags in 60 days or less will be given a higher weight in this factor.); and 3) Record of proven acceptable past performance.  For your convenience, the following forms and information are available and will be provided upon request and will be incorporated into the solicitation/contract:  Standard Form (SF)1449, Price Schedule, Offerors Representations and Certifications.   RFP submissions must be in writing and are due in the designated contracting office by 2:00 pm, local time, July 24, 2002, at the address noted below.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Sylvia can be reached by telephone at (210) 536-5773 if additional information is required. 

There are four Statements of  Work (SOWs) attached to the draft RFP to be used for the issuance of Task Orders against the Basic Contract.  Two of the SOWs will be selected to request cost proposals during the source selection process.  The cost proposals will be evaluated for cost realism.  The cost proposals will be negotiated after award of the basic contract.  All four of the SOWs will eventually be used to issue Task Orders on the new contract.  Cost proposals on the remaining two SOWs will be requested after award of the basic contract. 

There will also be a list of three to six competency questions to help determine technical capability and comprehension of the Statement of Objectives (SOO) attached to the final RFP.  The questions shall be answered by each Offeror during their oral presentation.  The following is a sample question:

	?Describe methods for measuring laser beam divergence in a military laser range finder including equipment model numbers to accomplish the task.  Assume that the beam divergence is known to be less than 0.5 mrad, but greater than 10 &#61549;rad and that the laser operates at 10 Hz.  The measurement will be conducted at the manufacturer site with equipment provided by the AFRL/HEDO measurement team and must therefore be easily transportable.?

The list of Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) with Data  (DID) numbers are attached.  The CDRLs will be attached when completed.  The DID information can be found at the following web site: http://assist.daps.mil.  

The DD Form 254, the security requirements for the contract performance will be attached when completed.       

A Site Visit for each of the offerors being contemplated.  If the you as an offerors determine such a visit would be beneficial, please notify Sylvia Small by E?mail at Sylvia.Small@brooks.af.mil.  The Site Visit, if required, will be scheduled by the Contracting Officer after the final RFP has been released.
 
Government Purchase Cards (GPC) may be used to fund the Task Orders issued against the basic contract.  A separate GPC will be used for each Task Order.  The procedure of using a GPC for funding will require the awardee of the contract to establish procedures with their financial institution for the acceptance of the GPC.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with Dr. Ravikiran Attota to evaluate the performance of the optical microscope for the Precision Engineering Division.  Proper alignment of the optics in the optical microscope is critical for the success of the project as the data obtained depends on this.  The microscope currently used was built in-house and has several parts that need to be aligned for its optimal performance.  Dr. Attota has worked closely with NIST and SEMATECH and has the expertise, extensive experience in our code and hardware, as well as the specific knowledge to perform these tasks.  He is capable of developing our software code immediately in Matlab to analyze images obtained using optical microscopes and scanning probe microscopes.  The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order on or about July 12, 2002.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, the Government will consider all capability statements received by July 5, 2002.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;  a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is Solicitation Notice No. AB133F-02-RP-0077.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 97-25. 

The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), is contracting for submersible dive days in waters around the central Aleutian Islands.  About seventeen days will be requested in July 2002, depending on availability of funds.  The submersible will be used to study the ecology and distribution of coral, evaluate the impact of fishing gear on seafloor habitat, and estimate commercially important demersal fish species on the continental shelf of both the Bering Sea and the North Pacific side of the islands.  The main purpose of this study is to collect live samples and video footage along a bathymetric gradient from approximately 30 to 350 m depth.  Vertebrates and invertebrates will be quantified from a downward oriented video camera, and from counts by a scientist viewing along the seafloor.  The submersible will be required to maintain a near constant depth off the seafloor and travel at fixed headings.  Performance capability of the contracted dive system is critical to the success of this research.  The total submersible system shall consist of a manned submersible, support ship, launch and retrieval system, competent crew, scientific laboratory space, and special equipment as specified below.  The charter contract will begin in Adak, Alaska and end in either Adak or Dutch Harbor, Alaska.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS, CAPABILITIES, AND SPECIFICATIONS

A.	MANNED SUBMERSIBLE

	1.  The submersible shall have the capability of carrying aboard at least one (1) observer and one (1) contractor-provided pilot, and shall have viewing ports accessible to the observer during all portions of the dive.  The Contractor shall provide at least two (2) fully qualified pilots for the purpose of alternating dive participation. 

	2. The submersible shall be capable of regularly operating to a depth of 360 m and must be able to operate in contact with and elevated above the seafloor over rugged substrate that includes boulders and coral.  The submersible shall be certified American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), or recognized equivalent (e.g., Lloyds, Det Norsk Veritas), to this depth, with appropriate documentation of inspection and construction.  If the certification will expire before or during the scheduled cruise dates, then evidence that the submersible is scheduled for recertification, and evidence of continuous previous certification in the past must be provided with bid submission.

This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside for those contractors servicing the southeast United States which have a NAICS Code Sector 233, 234, and 235. All other firms are deemed ineligible  to submit offers.

The contract contains two twelve-month options for a total maximum duration of thirty-six months or a value of $30 million whichever comes first.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to approximately three to five offerors based on factors that include: Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management & Organization, Scheduling. Phase I factors relate to the base year and tw o option year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including administrative, training, hospital, clinic, and community support type facilities, not just the seed project identified in the RFP. Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II. In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit additional information on Factor B (Technical/Management) and price proposals for a “seed” project, which has been identified as Replace Air Handling Units (AHU) at Bldg 9200, 3, 5, 6 & 13 floors at Martin Army Community Hospital at Fort Benning, GA.  The estimated price range for the seed project is $250,000 - $500,000.  The Government may choose to award the seed project based on initial proposals wit hout holding discussions.

The best value proposal for the seed project will be awarded the seed project and an IDIQ construction contract for the base year. The subsequent contracts will be awarded at the same time with a minimum guarantee of $10,000.  After pr oposal revisions (if necessary) are received, a best value award decision will be made based on the individual seed project. The selected firms will be requested to submit technical and price proposals for the seed project. Offerors who fail to submit tech nical and price proposals in Phase II for the seed project will not be considered for an award. The Government will award the seed project based on the most advantageous combination of price and technical factors that result in the overall best value award  to the Government. If discussions are required, they will be conducted with each offeror in the competitive range. At the conclusion of discussions, each offeror in the competitive range will be given an opportunity to submit a proposal revision. Price an d overall technical rating are of equal significance for the best value awards.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSIO N OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Phase II proposals will be requested from approximately three to five offerors who submitted proposals during Phase I which are determined to be the most highly qualified. Offerors should not assume that they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions to provide an opportunity for the offeror to revise  its proposal.  FOLLOW-ON WORK AFTER AWARD; All contractors awarded an IDIQ Contract will compete on subsequent task orders that may be scoped by the Government/Contractor team and may not have traditional plans & specs, but may include sketches and requests for catalog c uts and other submittals.

If the Government decides to iss ue the task order as a best value, award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.

<DESC>Optical Radiation Research and Field Services: Laser and Broadband Bioeffects and Personnel Protection, SSS PKR-02-02. Qualified sources are sought for professional scientific and engineering services in primary support of the Optical Radiation Branch, Air Force Research Laboratory?s Human Effectiveness Directorate; as well as provide support to US Army and US Navy biomedical detachments at Brooks AFB TX. Scientific, engineering, and analytical capabilities are sought to understand, mitigate, and exploit effects of optical radiation devices (lasers and broadband) and their countermeasures on personnel. Technical efforts will focus on six major areas: safety standards for optical sources; personnel susceptibility to optical sources; personnel protection against optical systems; high energy laser (HEL) safety analysis; optical radiation bioeffects; and optical radiation safety. Research will require experiments using human and non-human subjects, studies that correlate optical exposure with visual function and performance, threshold studies for eye and skin injuries, development of diagnostic and triage technologies and medical treatment modalities, development of methods to assess probability of exposure to optical radiation, and field hazard analysis of military and commercial systems. Efforts will require development and testing of protection technologies, low-vision models and simulations, medical accident registry and safety databases, operational engagement models, and special test equipment that measures physical, psychophysical, and environmental properties of optical protection. On-site government facilities equipment at Brooks AFB TX will be used, although performance of some work off-site is permissible and may be required. Potential offerors must be able to demonstrate capability in the areas of psychophysics, optical engineering, systems analysis, ophthalmology, optometry, mathematics, statistics, risk assessment visualization and simulation, laser physics, test and measurement, non-linear optics, or theoretical physics. A thorough knowledge of laser safety and biomedical literature, personnel protection technologies, visual performance in military environments, and radiometry across the optical waveband is essential, as well as capabilities and experience in software engineering that would be at least the equivalent of CMM Level II certification criteria. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) 60 month, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is contemplated for this effort. Any contract awarded from this requirement will require the contractor to have a ?Cleared Facility.? Contractor personnel will be required to have a Secret security clearance, with some personnel cleared to the Top Secret level. Teaming is highly encouraged, as well as the use of technical consultants in academia and industry.

The closing date and time for this solicitation has not been extended and remains at 9:00 A.M. MST, 25 Ju ne 2002.  The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following question received in response to the solicitation. QUESTION: Solicitation states that this contract award is on an all or nothing basis. Many CLIN items are vendor specific.  Whilst we understand and are able to fulfill the technical and functionality requirements, we are unable to offer the specific set o f CLINs requested because they represent one vendor's specific solution. Please can you advise how we should respond to CLIN items that we know are not required for our solution and/or CLIN items that we do not understand the purpose of (since this is not defined in some cases).  The CLIN items that may fall into this category are: CLIN 0002, CLIN 0007, CLIN 0010, CLIN 0011, CLIN 0016, CLIN 0017.  Can you also please advise the purpose of CLIN 0010, CLIN 0011, CLIN 0016 and CLIN0017. ANSWER: The purpose of the specified CLINS is as follows: CLIN 0002 Real Time Data Transfer Boards-See the Performance Specifications (Salient Characteristics) paragraph 2.9.1 listed in the solicitation. CLIN 0007 Carrying and Storage Cases-The recorders are often transported to various locations throughout the base.  The cases are required to protect the units from dust and other elements as well as any other damage while they are in transit. CLIN 0010 Video Board-A mechanism to interface with the data recorder to provide simultaneous video recording capabilities.  CLIN 0011 Interface Cables-Transfer files/data from the recorder to a PC.  They are a mechanism for communication between the data recorder and a PC. CLIN 0016 Channel Expansion Unit-Expand the channel count of the original recorder. CLIN 0017 Interface Adapter-See the Performance Specifications (Salient Characteristics) paragraph 2.9.1 listed in the solicitation. If you cannot provide pricing for all the CLINS as they are listed in the solicitation for the reasons stated above, please annotate in your proposal that those CLINS are Not Separately Priced. If your company proposes alternate items that would provide th e same functional capabilities that the Government is seeking in the accessories currently listed, list the items you are proposing along with the proposed prices for those items.  IN ADDITION, YOUR PROPOSAL MUST DEMONSTRATE THAT THE UNIT YOU ARE PROPOSING  WILL PROVIDE ALL THE SAME TECHNICAL AND FUNCTIONAL CAPABILITIES/OPTIONS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO IF YOU HAD SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL FOR ALL THE CLINS SPECIFIED IN THE SOLICITATION.

<DESC>**** This modification serves as notice that the due date for submission of proposals is hereby extended to June 1, 2002.  All other terms of the solicitation remain unchanged.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;  a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is Solicitation Notice No. AB133F-02-RP-0077.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 97-25. 

The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), is contracting for submersible dive days in waters around the central Aleutian Islands.  About seventeen days will be requested in July 2002, depending on availability of funds.  The submersible will be used to study the ecology and distribution of coral, evaluate the impact of fishing gear on seafloor habitat, and estimate commercially important demersal fish species on the continental shelf of both the Bering Sea and the North Pacific side of the islands.  The main purpose of this study is to collect live samples and video footage along a bathymetric gradient from approximately 30 to 350 m depth.  Vertebrates and invertebrates will be quantified from a downward oriented video camera, and from counts by a scientist viewing along the seafloor.  The submersible will be required to maintain a near constant depth off the seafloor and travel at fixed headings.  Performance capability of the contracted dive system is critical to the success of this research.  The total submersible system shall consist of a manned submersible, support ship, launch and retrieval system, competent crew, scientific laboratory space, and special equipment as specified below.  The charter contract will begin in Adak, Alaska and end in either Adak or Dutch Harbor, Alaska.

		b. A dual-beam laser system shall be mounted on the external video camera so as to allow scientists to determine the size of subject/area to be video recorded.

	5.  The submersible shall have a hand-held digital color video (with progressive scan mode capability) and a hand-held digital still camera for use inside the submersible.

	6.  Reasonable back-up photographic systems are requested, since video/film records will constitute the major database obtained.

	7.  All video footage and still photographs collected from the submersible during the contract period are the property of the U.S. government and may not be reproduced without the permission of the chief scientist.  
	
	8.  An emergency transponder 27-35 KHz, 72-hour duration, pilot activated, shall be provided on the submersible.  In addition, a directional transponder/receiver system operable from the submersible is required for station marking and relocation of acoustically- tagged bottom sites.   
	
	9.  Readout of submersible heading and depth are required, and an altimeter is required.  The submersible shall also have a current meter to determine both the direction and speed of the current during dive operations or the means to attach a current meter provided by the scientific field party to the exterior of the submersible.  The submersible should be outfitted with a conductivity, temperature, depth and dissolved oxygen sensing array (Seabird SBE-19) or equivalent) that is linked to an operational data logging system or displayed on the video footage at the beginning and end of each dive.  

	10.  The submersible shall have communication equipment (i.e. underwater submersible to support vessel-surface communication).  Minimum range for such equipment (underwater model) shall be one-half (0.5) mile.  

	11.  During surface operations, the submersible must have a means for visual contact (strobe and locating beacon as a minimum).  

	12.  The submersible shall have bottom and surface emergency equipment such as emergency marker buoy (sub), emergency radio beacon and receiver (support ship), lift point which is the unencumbered point of attachment in event of emergency submerged retrieval (capable of supporting entire submersible's dry weight), etc.  

	13.  The submersible's contractor shall have an operations procedure manual including emergency procedures and safety precautions.  All observers/scientists will be briefed on these safety procedures and precautions prior to diving. Submersible supplies should include air/regulator for pilot and scientist; insulated emergency suits for prolonged submergence.

	14.  The life support system (O2 + C02 scrubber) systems of the submersible must be capable of supporting submersible occupants for at least 72 hours at an ambient temperature range of one (1) to twelve (12) degrees Celsius.  

	15.  The submersible shall have an acoustic tracking beacon for acquisition of depth/range from the support ship (e.g., Trackpoint II type or equivalent).  This system shall be made available to the scientific party for tracking other equipment (e.g., bottom trawls) during non-diving days.  The scientific party will supply transponders used for that purpose.   

	16.  The submersible system shall be capable of night diving.  

	17.  The submersible shall be of such a design as to minimize entanglement and to prevent damage to the submersible due to contact with bottom objects.  

	18.  The submersible shall have an operator controlled mechanical or hydraulic, manipulator arm to deploy and retrieve sampling gear and collect biological specimens.  The submersible shall also have a collection basket to allow multiple specimens to be collected during a single dive.

This amendment also serves as notice that Item number 4 under section B titled Support Vessel in  the original FedBizOpps notice dated May 8, 2002 is hereby deleted from the requirements.  Please see the revised statement of work below.  All other terms of the solicitation remain unchanged.
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation;  a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is Solicitation Notice No. AB133F-02-RP-0077.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 97-25. 

The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), is contracting for submersible dive days in waters around the central Aleutian Islands.  About seventeen days will be requested in July 2002, depending on availability of funds.  The submersible will be used to study the ecology and distribution of coral, evaluate the impact of fishing gear on seafloor habitat, and estimate commercially important demersal fish species on the continental shelf of both the Bering Sea and the North Pacific side of the islands.  The main purpose of this study is to collect live samples and video footage along a bathymetric gradient from approximately 30 to 350 m depth.  Vertebrates and invertebrates will be quantified from a downward oriented video camera, and from counts by a scientist viewing along the seafloor.  The submersible will be required to maintain a near constant depth off the seafloor and travel at fixed headings.  Performance capability of the contracted dive system is critical to the success of this research.  The total submersible system shall consist of a manned submersible, support ship, launch and retrieval system, competent crew, scientific laboratory space, and special equipment as specified below.  The charter contract will begin in Adak, Alaska and end in either Adak or Dutch Harbor, Alaska.

<DESC>The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC), 412th Test Wing, Electronic Warfare Directorate, is seeking offerors with demonstrated expertise and experience to support Test, Operations and Maintenance (TO&M) for the Air Force Electronic Warfare Evaluation Simulator (AFEWES), a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) Test and Evaluation (T&E) facility located at Air Force Plant No. 4, Fort Worth, Texas.  The Air Force Flight Test Center intends to award a five-year fixed priced Indefinite Quantity contract that has a three-year base period with one two-year priced option period.  Anticipated award will be in Q3 FY03 with the performance period to begin 1 Oct 2003. Since the facility inception in 1958, AFEWES simulations have been developed, operated, maintained, and periodically upgraded at the AF Plant 4 location by Lockheed-Martin Aeronautics Company (or its predecessors) under contract to the United States Air Force.  AFEWES contains high-fidelity, fully-dynamic background (open-loop) and primary player (closed-loop) T&E resources in the Radio Frequency (RF), Millimeter Wave (MMW), and Infrared (IR) spectral regions.  AFEWES simulations represent widely diverse computer and technology levels.  All simulations operate in real-time, at real frequency/wavelength.  The RF/MMW background player simulation is the Multiple Emitter Generator (MEG).  When used autonomously, the MEG provides a dense signal environment for testing passive Electronic Warfare (EW) receivers.  When used in conjunction with the Primary Players, the MEG supports multi-spectral T&E and the evaluation of defensive countermeasures effectiveness in a realistically dense battlefield scenario.  The RF primary player simulations are high-fidelity Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM), simulations that operate between 0.5 and 18.0 GHz.  IR primary player simulations are comprised of multiple red and gray SAM and Air-to-Air Missile (AAM) simulations which include representative hardware, integrated with a flight motion table and target scene projector that operates at correct IR wavelengths.  AFEWES simulations support testing throughout all phases of the electronic warfare acquisition cycle for Department of Defense (DoD), foreign military customers, and contractor EW programs.  Successful TO&M contract performance requires in-depth knowledge, and hands-on staffing to perform daily testing, operating and maintenance functions.  Additionally, technical management of the AFEWES test facility is required.  Firms having an interest, capability and appropriate background are invited to submit particulars of qualification and experience.  This solicitation will be solicited in accordance with Air Force Material Command FARS Clause 5352.227-9001, (Jul 1997) Qualification of Offeror under Export-Controlled Restricted Solicitation, which states: This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  Only U.S. Contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation.  If you are registered and certified with DLSC, you must submit a copy of the approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the solicitation.  The solicitation will be mailed to the data custodian identified in Block 3 of the DD Form 2345.

Offerors must have the capability to operate and maintain the existing AFEWES systems without the use of pre-existing operation and maintenance manuals, as they do not currently exist.  The offerors ability to upgrade existing simulators according to latest information will be evaluated as well as their ability to acquire replacement or spare parts for and repair simulators and Special Test Equipment (STE).  Critical to this program is the offerors knowledge, capability, and demonstrated performance to develop and/or integrate new simulators and STE into the existing AFEWES architecture as this new equipment becomes available from AFEWES upgrade tasks/contracts.  Offerors must be able to immediately operate, without delay from contract award, all AFEWES Infrared and Radio Frequency simulators, including, but not limited to, the Jammer Techniques Simulator, Multi-Emitter Generator,  AFEWES Clutter Generator, RF and IR high-fidelity threat simulators and other unique, one-of-a-kind AFEWES test equipment.  Offerors must have the in-depth knowledge to prepare, set-up, and conduct tests without delay in all areas of the AFEWES laboratory complex.  Offerors must immediately possess the knowledge to perform operation and maintenance for the entire AFEWES facility; including unique computer control systems, simulator cable maintenance, flight motion tables, data collection and analysis equipment, secure communications and data transmission hardware and software and internal/external interfaces.  Offerors must be capable of integrating Government Furnished  Equipment into applicable AFEWES simulators and configuring this equipment for Open Air Range data input, processing, and operations. Because of the nature of EW testing, and the technical characteristics of the simulators, the successful offeror will be required to have as a minimum, a secret clearance, and be qualified to upgrade the clearance to TOP SECRET, immediately upon award.  

Offerors possessing the capability to perform the requested work are invited to submit a summary of their capabilities and descriptive literature addressing the above technical areas. The statement of capability should include relevant background and experience, with contract numbers, names and phone numbers of contracting office POC, and names and phone numbers of technical office POC for each contract.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center (TACOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey, 07806-5000, is currently seeking qualified sources with the capability to conduct research on the development of the next generation of “smart” coatings for Army materiel through the use of nanotechnology.The coatings applied to weapon systems today are "dumb" in the sense that once applied they perform their function without the ability to self-correct because of changing circumstances or without the ability to tell the user of potential anomalies such as corrosion or adhesion problems. Their application and removal is also labor intensive and potentially hazardous to the people working with them. Most of these coatings need to be "touched-up" by hand and hide substrate damage from the user of the product. As a result, the Army estimates that the total cost for DOD corrosion related problems is $10 billion per year, $2 billion of which is related to painting/depainting operations. In order to reduce the levels of corrosion on various Army weapon systems, a coating prototype will be developed. This prototype coating will incorporate nanomachines (i.e. powders in the coatings, gears, motors as well as electronic switches) that allow the coating to have characteristics such as self-healing, camouflage, selective removal, corrosion resistant, contain sensors, be able to alert the sustainment community of potential problems with the coating, be able to modify physical characteristics on command. What is specifically required is to investigate the use of nanomachines for development of smart coatings (baseline survey), enhance existing equipment for smart coating development, develop coatings with nanomachines and nanocapsules containing corrosion inhibiting and self-healing chemicals, test to determine sensor integrity and substrate integrity, perform material characterization (matrix material, characterize microstructure, perform preliminary corrosion / wear tests, prepare samples, impact assessment (compile emission and waste production data, prepare process cost data). Phase II will consist of the coating application and performance evaluation to include defining formal testing requirements, performing development and laboratory testing of corrosion inhibiting and self-healing coatings, performing mechanical properties testing, perform material performance testing, testing to ensure attributes of existing coatings are not degraded, preparing test report based on findings, determining final coating composition, determining what materiel coating can be applied to, scale-up of the process and produce enough coating material for limited field testing. An applicant will be required to submit information on the following: A. Personnel -What is required for the contract recipient is to have knowledge and expertise on nanotechnology including nanomachines, coating development, along with a demonstrated track record on previous DOD efforts in this area. The applicant shall possess sufficient personnel to manage, operate and support a research facility; conduct research & development activities, process modeling, collect and analyze data mentioned above, maintain instrumentation, and effect technology transfer of generated data in accordance with non- disclosure and proprietary data agreements with the government, industry and academia.  B. Dedicated Research & Development Facilities–Class-10 Cleanroom, Microelectronics Research Center, laboratory facilities and capabilities for the development of smart coatings from Army and DOD sources. C. Technology Transfer –The applicant shall possess the ability to create and  maintain a reporting system to report test results and effect the widest  dissemination of test data.

<DESC>A-E Services for the New U. S. Courthouse, Nashville, Tennessee
GS-04P-02-EXC-0038.  Additional Questions and Answers:

Q.  Is it GSA's preference that the response to question #1, address the work of the Lead Designer's firm, rather than the "A/E firm" who will be the architect of record?

A.  The "A/E firm" can be just the Lead Designer's firm or if the Lead Designer is associating in some way with a production firm or local firm the team can be considered the "A/E firm."  The Lead Designer is not required to associate with another firm in Stage 1 (or ever, as long as the designer's firm meets the geographic restrictions).  Thus, projects presented by the "A/E firm" can be from the Lead Design firm, an associate
firm or both.

Q.  Should the A/E firm with whom the Lead Designer's firm intends to teen be included in the 255, or should the 255 list only the Lead Designer's firm?

A.  If the Lead Designer associates with another firm in Stage I, the 255 should reflect both firms and 254's should be submitted for both firms.  Again, the design firm is NOT required to team with any other firm in Stage I, but may if they choose.

Q.  For the 255, in block 6 (list the sub-consultants and whether you've worked with them in the past), should the Lead Designer identify the proposed sub-consultant team, or leave this blank?

A.  Identification of consultants or sub-consultants is not required in Stage 1.

Q.  In meeting the GSA subcontracting goals: SBE 40%, MBE 8%, WBE 5%, Service Disabled Veteran Owned 2.5%, Hubzone Small Business 2.5%, and DBE 2.5%, are we allowed to use a firm that meets one goal to also go toward another?for example, an MBE that is also an SBE?

A.  Only in the case of a Hubzone small business.  For example, if you are a woman-owned small business and a Hubzone small business, then you could meet the goal in both areas.

Q.  What is the status of the historic assessment of the parking garage on the Church Street site 12; is there an underground tank and utilities on this site; and is this site still under consideration?

A.  We are still conducting the environmental and historical evaluations.  There are utility lines running through the alleys on this site.  Site 12 is still under consideration.

Q.  Do the projects included in the past performance on the design and the Lead Designer's portfolio sections have to be completed through construction?  

A.  They do not have to be completed through construction but greater weightier will be given to those that are substantially complete compared to those that are not substantially complete.

Q.  Do we have to include the entire 255 sections in addition to the information asked in the evaluation criteria, including the resumes?  Should we answer an entire question 10 on the 255 in addition to the evaluation criteria?

A.  No resumes are required in Stage 1, except the information represented in the Lead Designer's credentials.  Firms may present projects as part of the 255 in addition to the ones they want considered for the firm's and the Lead Designer's projects, but it is certainly not required.

Q.  Given the nature of the site and the fact that the project involves urban planning, can we show planning projects that entail urban/security aspects?

A.  The selection of projects is at your discretion.

Q.  Who is the Peer Advisor for this proposal?

A.  We don't release that information.

Q.  Is this project in the state of conceptual drawings that will be used to determine the CMc and then be bid for the various?

A.  No, we are not in the conceptual drawings stage.  We are in the process of selecting an Architect/Engineering firm.
