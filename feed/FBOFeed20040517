1.0 INTRODUCTION: The new NOAA Ship HI'IALAKAI requires a remotely operated submersible vehicle (ROV) for the ship-based field research.  The HI'IALAKAI will support government organizations conducting research throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago and U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands. 
2. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND SCOPE OF WORK: The diversity of ecosystem monitoring and assessment projects to be supported by the HI'IALAKAI requires the ROV to be capable of (1) Reliable operation in a remote offshore environment, at time in open ocean currents, to a depth of 2,000 feet (600m); (2) Steady maneuvering near potentially rugged coral on the seafloor, at times making contact with the bottom.  This requires high power to weight ratio and a low center of gravity; (3) Using a video camera system with operator display; (4) Staging from ship's deck.  This requires portability and straightforward control features; (5) Field maintainable, without special tools or training; (6) Option for later field upgrade, to add a manipulator arm. Piloting of the ROV must be sufficiently intuitive for relatively inexperienced technicians, and as such NOAA requires that the ROV be a commercial-off-the-shelf product with a proven design and a number of completed previous deliveries.  Minor modifications to a standard package to meet requirements are acceptable, but a completely new designed package is not acceptable.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice of a two-step bid process for a construction project pursuant to FAR 14.5.  Interested firms must submit a faxed request on company letterhead to 202-220-5711 no later than 3:00PM (EST) on Friday, April 9, 2004, which clearly indicates the firm’s intent to participate in the two-step bid process.  Faxed requests shall include both a company fax number, a point of contact and an e-mail for the point of contact.  Under Step One of the two-step bid process, the government will issue a solicitation letter to interested firms.  The government’s letter will direct firms on how to submit written technical proposals addressing the following elements:  (a)  Key Personnel (qualifications and experience), (b) Corporate Experience (as evidenced by past and present performance on similar projects), (c) Procedures to be used to ensure contract requirements are met (Quality Control Program), (d)  Start-up and Phase-In Schedule.  The government considers factors (a) and (b) to be of equal importance and relatively more important than the equally important factors of (c) and (d).  Proposals will be initially evaluated element by element using the following scale:  Exceptional, Very Good, Satisfactory, Marginal, Unsatisfactory.  Each technical proposal will then be categorized as Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of being made Acceptable, or Unacceptable.  The government may proceed to Step Two without requesting further information from any offeror.  However, the government reserves the right to request clarifying or supplemental information from offerors that it considers Reasonably Susceptible of being made Acceptable.  Prospective firms are advised only one technical proposal may be submitted by each offeror and initial submissions should be complete, accurate, and readily understood.  Only firms rated as Acceptable under Step One will be allowed to submit sealed bid pricing under Step Two, subsequent to a mandatory Site Visit.  The sealed bidding process under Step Two will not be synopsized or publicly posted, however the names of firms with acceptable proposals in Step One will be listed through a notice on FedBiz Opps (for the benefit of prospective subcontractors).

<DESC>Description:  The Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Agency (DOE/NNSA), Training and Development Division (T&DD) in Albuquerque is seeking sources interested in the operation of cafeteria/snack bar and catering services on-site at the Energy Training Complex  (ETC) located at 1401 Maxwell Street, Kirtland Air Force Base West, Albuquerque, NM 87118. The ETC is located within a secure military compound; therefore, only authorized personnel may gain entry.    It is anticipated that a five-year memorandum of agreement will be issued, where the vendor?s compensation will consist of receipts less cost of goods sold expenses (including payroll, taxes, supplies etc.).  The ETC has 13,000 square feet of dedicated training space (13 classrooms), and can accommodate up to 700 students at any given time.  Based on historical information, an average of 2,500 to 3,000 individuals per month utilize the cafeteria/snack bar services. It is anticipated that a minimum of 20%-to 30% may elect to eat at the cafeteria/snack bar for breakfast or lunch.  It is possible, but not guaranteed that this number could increase, as the vendor will be allowed to market and advertise their services, subject to prior government approval.  The service required will include breakfast, lunch and the provision of ready-to-eat items/snacks, such as yogurt, chips, fresh fruit, etc., and hot/cold beverages available at all times.  The hours of operation for the cafeteria/snack bar are 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 7:30 to 1:00 on Friday.  Catering will be on an as needed basis for classes and seminars.  Normally, the vendor will be the exclusive catering provider. However, due to the fact that federal appropriations cannot be used for food, refreshments, etc., there are a few occasions (historically these have been less than 10 requests per year, which is minimal), on a case-by-case basis, where Federal ONLY employees may request a waiver for catering services and bring in their own food/refreshments.  All requests for waiver must be made to and approved by the Training Administration Program Manager in advance. There are approximately 800 classes/seminars/meetings a year with approximately 35,000 attendees annually.  The average length of these classes/seminars/meetings varies.  Most classes/seminars are at least two days in length and meeting usually range from one to two full days.  Description of facilities: The square footage for the cafeteria/snack bar is approximately 5200 square feet. Seating capacity is 75 people.  Chaffing Dishes: Electric hotplates must be used rather than sterno heat for food that must be kept hot as sterno heating is not allowed in this facility.  Cafeteria/snack bar services will be provided 5 days per week, Monday through Friday, except holidays observed by the Federal government. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to provide a variety of quality prepared foods. The contractor shall meet business and industry standards of quality and nutrition and comply and support the 1990 and all subsequent revisions of the U.S. Dietary Guidelines. The variety and appearance of food in the cafeteria/snack bar on each operating day shall be consistent with approved food service industry standards for comparable "business and industry" cafeterias.  The vendor is also responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the cafeteria/snack bar and dining areas; and the proper closing/shut down each day (including completion of a daily security checklist).  The NNSA requests interested parties to submit a one to three page synopsis describing your capabilities as a cafeteria/snack bar and catering services provider and the services (i.e., menu and prices) your firm could provide. All capability statements will be reviewed by the NNSA. Creative approaches to providing the cafeteria/snack bar requirements are encouraged. A tour of the cafeteria/snack bar will be provided by the NNSA on Wednesday, May 26, 2004 at 2:00 pm Mountain Standard Time. In order to attend the tour offerors MUST contact the Contracting  Officer in writing, providing the name of your firm and the number of people attending. Offerors not attending the tour may submit capability statements. The NNSA does not intend to have a pre-solicitation conference. The Government will provide a dining area including tables and chairs.  Utilities, including gas, electricity, water and sewer, and utility connections to include gas, electricity, water, and sewer will be provided by the government.  Any interested firm should submit a capability statement to demonstrate the firm's qualifications/ability to provide the required services.  Submissions will be evaluated based on past performance, experience, menu cycle and variety/pricing, and financial considerations.  The deadline for submission of the capability statement is June 4, 2004.  The point of contact for this action is Kim Gallegos, telephone (505) 845-5848. Submissions should be sent electronically to Kim Gallegos at kgallegos@doeal.gov and Chris Saiz at cdsaiz@doeal.gov or mail to NNSA Service Center, P.O. Box 5400, Albuquerque NM 87185, Attn:  Kim Gallegos. Disclaimer:  This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued, nor will the government pay for the information solicited in this announcement. Javits-Wagner-O?Day Act (JWOD):  In accordance with this act, FAR part 8.7, and as a strong advocate of this act?s goals, NNSA will award an agreement to a vendor covered under this act should they submit a response that demonstrates they are capable of performing this effort.  Therefore, interested businesses under this Act are especially encouraged to respond to this notice. Small Business Preference:  NNSA is also a strong advocate for the small business community and interested small businesses/lead teams and joint ventures that qualify as small businesses are encouraged to submit a response to this notice.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation announcement.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will be soliciting bids utilizing full and open competition for the construction of Phases I, II, III, IV and V of the Academy-Wide Masonry Repair and Restoration Project at the FBI Academy, U.S. Marine Corps Base, Quantico, Virginia 22135.  The original 1972 FBI Academy encompassed a total of eleven (11) masonry buildings.  Over the past 32 years, all of these original masonry buildings have suffered exterior surface damage and discoloration as well as serious water infiltration as a result of deterioration of the masonry (brick) units, deterioration of the masonry mortar and deterioration of the "expressed" concrete structural elements.  Poor 1972 masonry construction on many buildings as well as poor design detailing at several conditions has contributed to serious water infiltration into the buildings.  Additionally, many of the buildings have architectural features that involve both horizontal and sloped brick surfaces.  Many of these surfaces have deteriorated to the point that organic matter and plants have infiltrated the surface, which promotes water retention and accelerates the deterioration through the annual freeze-thaw cycle.  Several of the areas have been unsuccessfully repaired in the past and these repairs have actually promoted further deterioration.  The masonry restoration will be broken down and bid approximately yearly in the following phases: Phase I: Buildings 1, 2, 3, and 4, with Bldg. 5 as an Add Alternate; Phase II: Buildings 7 and 8; Phase III: Buildings 6, 9 and 10; Phase IV: Buildings 11, 12 and 16; and Phase V: Building 5 (if required).  The masonry repair and restoration work for Phases I, II, III, IV and V consists of, but is not limited to the following work: scaffolding, landscape/lawn protection and repair, selective cutting and removal of face brick veneer and brick pavers, selective removal and repair of mortar joints in brick veneer, selective removal, salvage and reinstallation of metal coping and flashing, selective repair of spalled precast concrete beams, selective demolition and rebuilding of building parapets, mortar re-pointing, installation of new face brick, brick pavers, drainage boards, metal copings, EPDM base flashing,  joint sealers, modified bitumen waterproofing membranes, new architectural precast concrete column caps, spandrel panels and parapet copings, misc. steel angles, reinforcing and anchors, concrete coatings and masonry cleaning.  The estimated cost of the combined acquisitions is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  Bid, Payment and Performance Bonds are required.  The FBI contemplates the award of firm-fixed price contracts, released as multiple bid packages, as funding becomes available, for this requirement. The bidder awarded the resultant contracts shall be subject to background investigations on its' company and all individuals assigned to the project  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 238140. No further project information is available at this time.  Further information will be publicized in the FedBizOpps at a later date.  All inquiries shall be in writing referencing IFB No. 047053, and sent to the following address: FBI Academy, Laboratory Construction Management Team (LAB-CMT) Trailers, Quantico, Virginia 22135 and marked to the attention of Mr. Mark R. Hazen, Contract Administrator.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.***

<ARCHDATE>08152004
<CONTACT>Mark Ross 850-235-5624 , or Contracting Officer Margie Dulatt at 850-235-5398.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) to Magneto Inductive Systems Limited (MISL) USA of San Bernadino, CA on a sole source basis for an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for the Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and production phases of the Magneto Inductive-Remote Activation Munitions System (MI-RAMS) program. The effort will include LRIP planning, long lead item procurement, and the manufacture, inspection, test and delivery of MI-RAMS. The government anticipates a period of performance for five years under an ID/IQ contract. The first year of the effort will involve LRIP planning such as long lead item identification for the production of the MI-RAMS system currently being developed under a sole source contract to MISL, Nova Scotia. The follow on years will involve procurement of long lead items  and the manufacture of the MI-RAMS hardware. The MI-RAMS is a lightweight, compact, man-portable magneto inductive transmitter and receiver system to be used by Special Operation forces (SOF) and combat engineers. MI-RAMS provides the capability to remotely control the detonation of demolition charges or to remotely operate other items of equipment such as beacons, laser markers, weapons, ground marking lights, etc. MI-RAMS will reliably propagate a signal through natural or manmade media such as water, earth or building structures. MI-RAMS will be compatible and functional with radio frequency (RF) RAMS (i.e. MI-RAMS and RF-RAMS will be able to be daisy-chained as mission requirements, tactics and terrain dictate) providing the operator a synergistic increase in remote operation capabilities. The MI-RAMS will operate in all environments such as arctic, tropic, temperate, urba n, beach zone and the surf zone (littoral) to depths less than 10 feet. The planned start date for this effort will be 4QFY04. The acquisition objective is for up to 5000 each MI transmitters, 10,000 Auxiliary Power Packs, 25,000 each MI Type A receivers, 50,000 Type B MI  receivers. Detailed tasks will be provided, defining the required efforts, in individual delivery orders issued under the ID/IQ contract. This requirement is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), as applied in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii), is deemed applicable as the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by the unique supplies available from Magneto Inductive Systems Ltd, the only known supplier of magneto-inductive (MI) related technologies. NSWC-PC has determined that MISL is only known supplier of MI related technologies that can meet the op erational requirements of the MI-RAMS program. This determination was based on the results of 29 market surveys conducted by CSS/ONR since 1993 that resulted in no responses other than MISL. The MI-RAMS cannot be procured competitively utilizing a technical data package. Currently the patents and intellectual property rights to the relevant MI technologies either belong solely to  MISL or are Government patents licensed to MISL.     Additionally, per the approved MI-RAMS program Acquisition Plan, the LRIP and production quantities will be acquired from the system developer. MISL is the sole developer of MI-RAMS. NAICS Code 541710 applies. SBA Size Standard is 750 employees (based on NAICS Code 334290). FSC is 5895.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC-PC) intend to solicit quotes simplified acquisition (purchase order) of the following equipment from authorized distributors of Force Computers.   Six (6) each Force Computer SPARC/CPCI-550/1024-650-L512-8/IPMI 650 MHz CPU, 512 Kbyte L2 cache, 1024 Mbyte SDRAM base board memory, 8 Mbytes user Flash, 1 PMC slot, Force SAP 111214.  Six (6) each ACC/RTB-504 CPCI-550 Rear Transition Board for above CPU base board, Force SAP 109044.  One (1) each SPARC/SOL 8/RTU/LT, Solaris 8, RTU-license, high-tier-level, license only, Force SAP 109044.  This equipment is sought to expand the capabilities of the Coastal Battlefield Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA) Processing Station (CPS).  The CPS was designed to be scalable by increasing the number of processors and associated equipment.  Force Computer parts were used in the original system de sign and NSWC-PC seeks to increase the systems capabilities.  Use of any other parts would require extensive and costly testing to ensure 100% compatibility. The cost of these tests would far exceed any cost savings due to alternative parts.   Delivery will be to the Receiving Officer, Naval Support Activity Panama City, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City Beach, FL, 32407-7018.  NAICS Code 54151 applies. SBA Size Standard is 500 employees. FSC is 7021. A request for quotation will be utilized in awarding this action on or about 01 June 04.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and using the simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13.5.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation N68936-04-T-0069 is issued as a request for quotations.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-22.  This agency has a requirement for 20 SeaDoo GTX4-TEC personal watercraft for conversion into the Navy’s Ship Deployable Surface Target (SDST). CLIN 0001 (QTY-20 EA), Description: SeaDoo GTX 4TEC Personal Watercraft; The following requirements apply to CLIN 0001: The craft must be able to tow a 5-man inflatable banana sled at 40 knots, in a calm sea, with a 200 foot, one-eighth inch spectra line.  The craft must fit a mast assembly, existing actuator assemblies, a Global Positioning System Node box, a Radio Frequency Modem Node box, a linear potentiometer box, and a Personal Water Craft controller node box.  The craft must be of sufficient weight and size to provide acceptable performance in ocean conditions. Additional salient characteristics include: closed loop cooling; four stroke engine; fiberglass hull; single button start/stop operation; able to obtain a maximum speed of 49 knots in a calm sea; minimum storage capacity of 52 U.S. gallons. CLIN 0002 (QTY-20 EA), Description: Galvanized Trailer. The following requirements apply to CLIN 0002. Capable of towing CLIN 0001 including: 1100 lb. GVWR; aluminum or galvanized steel; fully adjustable and carpeted bunks; adjustable bow post; fully sealed light system; adjustable front parking jack; legal for highway towing.  This requirement is a sole source to SeaDoo, a division of Bombardier Recreational Products. The Navy has designed the SDST around the SeaDoo GTX4-TEC. The electronics and mechanics of the remote control system for the SDST were designed specifically for SeaDoo GTX-4TEC. Start/Stop wiring interface as well as RPM sensing and Tip Over Protection sensing must be exactly as it is on the GTX4-TEC. Choosing another manufacturer’s model would mean redesign of mast assembly, mechanical linkages, and electronic interface to the boat electrical system. It would also mean a new round of extensive sea trials and testing would have to be conducted. The amount for electrical redesign is estimated to be $28,000; the amount for mechanical redesign is estimated to be $40,000; and the amount for sea trials and retesting is estimated to be $77,000. This would cause a substantial duplication of costs to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. The provisions at FAR 52.212 1, Instructions to Offerors, Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. Firms submitting quotes on the SeaDoo GTX4-TEC must provide with their quotes published price lists and sales data to verify the reasonableness of their proposed prices. Offerors must include a complete copy of the provision at 52.212 3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items, with his/her offer, and also at DFARS 252.212 7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items.  The clause at FAR 52.212 4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The clause at FAR 52.212 5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The following additional clauses cited within FAR clause 52.212 5 are applicable to this acquisition, and are hereby included By Reference: 52.203 6, 52.219 8, 52.222 21, 52.222 26, 52.222 35, 52.222 36, 52.222 37, 52.225 3, 52.225 13, 52.225 15, and 52.232 33.  The clause at DFARS 252.212 7001, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  The following additional clauses cited within DFARS clause 252.212 7001 are applicable to this acquisition, and are hereby included By Reference: 252.205 7000, 252.225 7001, 252.225 7012, 252.243 7002, and 252.247 7023.  DFAR 252.204 7004, Required Central Contractor Registration, applies to this solicitation, therefore FAR clause 52.212 3 paragraph (b)(2), relating to TIN number, does not apply to this solicitation.  DFAR 252.225 7000, Buy American Act – Balance of Payments Program Certificate, applies to this solicitation.  DFAR 252.225 7017, Prohibition on Award to Companies Owned by the People’s Republic of China, applies to this solicitation.  The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating for this contract will be DO A3.  Delivery of CLIN 0001 shall be 10 units 37 days after award of contract and the remaining 10 units 44 days after award of contract.  Delivery of CLIN 0002 shall be 10 units 37 days after award of contract and the remaining 10 units 44 days after award of contract. There is an anticipated contract award date of 30 June 2004.  Delivery of CLINs 0001 and 0002 units will be FOB Destination, Receiving Officer, Naval Air Station, Point Mugu, CA, with all charges for shipping and transportation pre-paid, in accordance with the clause FAR 52.247 34 titled FOB DESTINATION (NOV 1991).  Mark shipment for: Commander, Code 531500E, ATTN: Yuri Lozovskiy, CBC Seaborne Targets, Building 465A, Port Hueneme, CA 93043.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a one-year extension to the Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance Support Services Contract, NAS9-19180, with Scientific Applications International Corporation (SAIC). The existing cost-plus-award fee, level-of-effort contract has a period of performance from April 1, 1995 through March 31, 2005.  This one-year action will extend services to March 31, 2006.   The services contemplated for the one-year extension fall within the scope of the existing statement of work.  Services include the overall Safety and Mission Assurance (S&MA) support to the Space Shuttle Program (SSP), the International Space Station (ISS) Program, the Crew Exploration Vehicle Program, to all Government-Furnished Equipment developed at the Johnson Space Center (JSC), to both SSP and ISS-related Extravehicular Activity hardware and operations, and to both SSP and ISS payloads.  Services will also include real-time support as required in the JSC Mission Evaluation Room, reviewing in-flight anomalies, and assuring that resolution of anomalies does not violate S&MA requirements, and represents a safe course of action for the program(s).   NASA/JSC intends to extend the existing contract with SAIC supported by a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).    Only the incumbent is uniquely situated to avoid the steep learning curve associated with transition activities while mitigating critical safety risk concerns during Return to Flight (RTF) activity.	Since SAIC has the skills, knowledge, training, personnel, and corporate knowledge to perform the work contemplated, no phase-in activities will be required, thus effectively mitigating risk.  The term of the extension is warranted to insure avoidance of this situation if the RTF launch date continues to slip.  JSC/NASA has every intention of conducting a Full and Open Competition for the follow-on procurement to this one-year extension.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. See note 22.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on June 03, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Sandra Queen, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-267-2482, Fax 202-267-4019, Email squeen@comdt.uscg.mil
<DESC>QUESTION SIX

Your documents indicate that "the survey shall occur at a date acceptable to both the MLC and the surveying organization".  Currently, the XXXX  XXXXXX contacts the healthcare organization before the due date of the accreditation resurvey.  The corresponding invoice is then mailed approximately 30 days in advance of the survey.  However, in 2006, this process will be changing.  We are anticipating that the survey will be unannounced.  We have not finalized the details of this new process, the impact on government facilities (and related solutions) or the pricing model that may be in place at that time.  Please advise of any issues that we need to consider assuming that the Coast Guard surveys would be unannounced as of 2006.
ANSWER SIX
The XXXX XXXXXX would need to coordinate with the MLC for the survey date based on the anticipated dates provide in the schedule.  The MLC will survey the U.S. Coast Guard specific items at that time and would need to coordinate the surveys to occur together to minimize impact to patient care activities in the clinics.  Additionally, there are no provisions in the solicitation for advanced payments. 
QUESTION SEVEN
Your documents reference the handling of travel expenses.  The XXXX XXXXXXXX does not charge expenses related to survey travel on our survey invoices.  However, we do charge applicable branch fees if they are defined in our price list and the situation warrants billing the healthcare organization.  
ANSWER SEVEN
The USCG does not have clinic branches. 
QUESTION EIGHT
Attached to this e-mail is our published price list for all survey types that we currently accredit.  Please note that the price list is for 2004 only.  Our Board of Commissioners reviews and approves our prices each November that would be effective the upcoming year.  The 2005 price list will be available in December 2004.  Each year, thereafter, would be published approximately 30 days in advance of the new calendar year.  We create our invoices based on information that is contained in these published pricing lists.  "Firm fixed price basis" cannot be defined as the fee that is guaranteed today for anything past 2004 as those fees are not yet defined and approved.  Please advise if you need additional information on our process or need further clarification.  

ANSWER EIGHT
This contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price basis.  All option year prices must be identified in the proposals for evaluation prior to award.   
QUESTION NINE
In order to appropriately estimate the survey fees for you, please refer to the pricing list that I have included and review the information under our Ambulatory programs.  Our pricing for these services are based on volume of annual visits for each healthcare organization.  If multiple services are provided, the service with the highest risk prevails (i.e., surgery and anesthesia are higher risk then medical and dental).  Can you indicate, by facility, the number of annual visits and type of service to be surveyed based on this model?  Depending on the types of lab services offered at each site, lab surveys would need to be conducted every two years instead of every three years.  Please include additional information for each site as well if possible.
ANSWER NINE 
The detail for each clinic will be included in their specific application for survey.  The USCG labs are all CLIA certified and do not need lab accreditation as a separate function.  The lab should be included as part of the overall accreditation, not as a separate entity.   
QUESTION TEN 
On page 1 of the Performance Work Statement, is it your expectation that "the next accreditation survey is due to begin immediately upon award" to mean that the survey needs to be scheduled or physically surveyed upon award.  For example, if the award is given to the XXXXX  XXXXXXX, is it your expectation that we will be out the next day in Alameda, California or on July 13, 2004 as indicated in Section B.1?
ANSWER TEN 
The survey schedule is depicted in Section B of the solicitation.
QUESTION ELEVEN 
On page 2 of the Performance Work Statement, who provides the employee identification that you require?  Is it provided to the surveyor team when they reach the healthcare organization or do we need to obtain all identifications for our surveyors before they reach each site?
 
ANSWER ELEVEN
Any surveyor shall have their own ID from their organization.  A clinic visitor ID will be issued upon their arrival to each facility. 
QUESTION TWELVE
We currently work with many of the military branches and they use a calendar basis for their contracts so as to coincide with our fiscal year as well as our pricing year.  Is this possible to incorporate with the Coast Guard?  If not, we can accommodate the current solicitation time table.
ANSWER TWELVE
The contract will be from date of award through the following 365 days as stated in the solicitation.
QUESTION THIRTEEN
Our survey team has flexible hours of operation when they survey each organization.  We have conducted surveys before 0800 and finished after 1600 if this best fit the needs of the organization.  However, if you would prefer that all sites be completed between 0800 and 1600, we can accommodate this as well.  Please advise as to your preference.
ANSWER THIRTEEN
It is anticipated that the surveys will be conducted during the established clinic hours of operation, which are generally 0800 to 1600.  However, if other scheduling works better for the clinic and the contractor, that can be accommodated on a case-by-case basis. 
QUESTION FOURTEEN 
The post survey support mentioned in 5.2 is completed by the XXXX  XXXXXX.  In our current survey process model, the surveyor team would leave a preliminary report with each organization.  The final report is issued to the organization from our office in XXXXXXX.  The organization would be sent an e-mail to indicate that their final report is ready for viewing on our secured extranet site.  Please advise if this would not meet your requirements.
ANSWER FOURTEEN
The requirements for reporting are stated in the Performance Work Statement.  Should you chose to provide an alternative to that schedule, you may submit that with your proposal. 
QUESTION FIFTEEN 
Depending on the type of survey required, we send the appropriate number of surveyors needed to complete the survey.  Therefore, it is possible that one, two or more surveyors would be sent to a site.  Please advise if this will not meet your requirement as listed in your statement of work where you require two health care professionals.
ANSWER FIFTEEN
It is anticipated that 2 surveyors would be needed per survey.  However, there may be reason to adjust that number due to the size of the survey location. This would be handled on a case-by-case basis, prior to the survey and would be incorporated into the contract by formal modification. 
QUESTION SIXTEEN 
I want to clarify for purposes of pricing that an admission to the clinic at Training Center Cape May is considered an outpatient 24 hour observation stay and not an inpatient admission.  Please advise.
ANSWER SIXTEEN 
The observation unit at Training Center Cape May is observation only, not inpatient care.  The unit is used for convalescence since recruits do not have a home to go to when procedures such as extensive dental work are done.  To get them out of the training regimen, and allow them a place to rest and recover, they are provided a bed in the observation area.   
QUESTION SEVENTEEN
For Contract HSCG23-04-R-PMB012, Section L.8 on page 37under "Requirements for Proposal Format", it states, "Page limitations and number of copies below:" However, it appears there is no related information "below". Although I have noted that Standard Form 33 states that an original and four copies (5 sets total of the proposal) are to be submitted, there is no reference to "page limitations", which I am assuming concerns the number of pages. Other format instructions appear earlier under the heading "Requirements for Proposal Format" but do not discuss number of pages if such a limitation exists.  What additional instruction can you provide regarding number of pages or other page limitations that do not appear as referenced on page 37?.

ANSWER SEVENTEEN

There is no limitation on the number of pages that can be submitted with the proposals. A total of 5 proposals shall be submitted.

QUESTION EIGHTEEN

Part III - Section J "List of Attachments", indicates an Attachment 2 of
1 page, titled "Personnel Data Form". I am unable to locate this attachment
among the website posted materials. How can I obtain this attachment?

ANSWER EIGHTEEN

This form will be provided at time of award.

THE SOLICITATION FOR THE PROPOSED CONTRACT TASK ORDER 0001 WILL BE UPLOADED HERE BY CLOSE-OF-BUSINESS OF 18 MAY 2004.*****


This acquisition is solicited on an unrestricted basis utilizing full and open competition. The applicable NAICS code 541330, Environmental Engineering Services. A fixed price, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Environmental Multiple Award Contract (EMAC), for Air Quality Compliance at various locations in California (CA), Arizona (AZ), Nevada (NV), New Mexico (NM), Utah (UT), Alaska (AK), Washington (WA), Oregon (OR), Idaho (ID), and Montana (MT) is anticipated.
 
This notice is a synopsis of the solicitation that will be issued on or about 14 May 2004.  The objective of the solicitation is to acquire environmental engineering services and incidental architect-engineering services to various Navy and Marine Corps facilities, and other government facilities located in the above-mentioned states, to meet statutory compliance requirements for all applicable environmental laws and regulations with regard to air quality. The majority of the work will be performed in CA.  The exact location of work will be identified in each contract task order (CTO).  Additionally, the contract may provide air compliance support to CERCLA, RCRA, and Base Closure and Realignment (BRAC) projects. 

The proposed CTO 0001 requirement entails providing air quality engineering services using U.S. Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma, AZ, as a model facility.  Technical details will be provided at the site visit, which is scheduled for 2 June 2004.  All participants will meet at the Avenue 3E gate of MCAS Yuma at 7:30 A.M., 2 June 2004.  Offerors participating in the site visit must fax or email the following information on company letterhead no later than 14 May 2004 to Chon S. Son at 619-532-0771, chon.son@navy.mil:  company name, name(s) of participant(s) and Social Security number(s), dates of birth, and U. S. citizenship status. Costs associated with participating in the site visit or responding to the solicitation will not be compensated.

Services shall be provided in accordance with the current Architectural-Engineering (A-E) Guide for A-E firms performing services for SOUTHWESTNAVFACENGCOM. All references identified in the basic contract remain in full effect. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to award contract(s) to other than the offeror(s) submitting the lowest total price(s); and to award contract(s) to the offeror(s) determined to be the most advantageous to the government. Award(s) may be made without discussions or any contact concerning the proposals received. 

The basic contract(s) will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods. The minimum guarantee for each basic contract awarded is $5,000.  The minimum guarantee applies to the five-year term of the basic contracts.  The aggregate value of CTOs issued under the basic contracts combined shall not exceed $15,000,000.  Since the Government may award the basic contracts without discussions, offerors should submit proposals containing their most favorable terms. Awards will be made using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, competitive negotiation procedures.  Basic contracts will be awarded to two or more responsible firms whose proposals, conforming to the solicitation, offer the "Best Value" to the Government, price and other factors considered. 

The Government reserves the right not to award the proposed CTO 0001 identified in this notice or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contracts. The number and dollar value of CTOs awarded under each basic contract will depend upon the results of the CTO competition conducted among the firms that receive basic contract awards. CTOs will be competed on a firm fixed price basis among basic contract awardees in accordance with FAR 16.505(b). 

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors: Factor 1 – Specialized Experience; Factor 2 – Past Performance; Factor 3 – Engineering and Management Approaches, which are of equal importance to each other; and Factor 4 – Price, which is slightly less important than any one of the other factors. When the proposal is evaluated as a whole, Factors 1, 2, and 3 combined are significantly more important than Factor 4.  The importance of price will increase if offerors are considered essentially equal in terms of technical capability, or if a price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the proposal's technical superiority to the government. Proposals shall be submitted in format as specified in solicitation Clause L-4, Proposal Submission Requirements.
  
The solicitation will be available only by electronic media and can be downloaded free of charge via the Internet web sites at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil or http://eps.gov under pre-solicitation notice N68711-04-R-1103.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) SOLEY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE. This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on engineering support for the development, fabrication, and test of integrating a Combat Identification capability into an advanced targeting pod.  This is a request for information only.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB) is planning to conduct an initiative that will evaluate the feasibility and advantage of integrating a sensor to interrogate an Athena RF tag into an advanced targeting pod.  The envisioned system should integrate lightweight radar such as Lynx that is capable of communicating with an RF tag.  Given that capability, Coalition Combat Air Forces could identify friendly ground forces from assets equipped with targeting pods in a battlefield environment.  The AEFB is primarily interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be adapted for this purpose.

The AEF Battlelab is seeking information from industry representatives who would be interested in providing engineering and fabrication support to produce and certify an operational prototype item for this initiative demonstration.  The objectives of this initiative include demonstrating the capability to design and integrate small, lightweight radar capable of interrogating an Athena RF tag into existing USAF targeting pods.  The system should be capable of displaying the tag data on the aircraft Multifunction Display (MFD) or an equivalent display. The Athena RF tag is a dual band device designed by Sandia National Laboratories capable of receiving a radar signal and reflecting the waveform with embedded data. The Athena tag is currently being developed and evaluated in the ongoing AEF Battlelab’s Alert Data Embedded Passive Tag (ADEPT) Initiative, which is part of the US Army’s Radar Tag Engagement (RaTE) Program.  The RaTE program has two focuses--Blue Force Tracking and Coalition Combat Identification. 

Request information be submitted to Lt Col Sobrero, Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648, NO LATER THAN 14 June 2004.  Lt Col Sobrero can be reached at (208) 828-3506.  Please provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate for conducting this initiative.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>IDAHO NATIONAL ENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL LABORATORY SEEKS INDUSTRIAL PARTNERS CAPABLE OF COMMERCIALIZING METHODS FOR RECOVERY OF DAUGHTER ISOTOPES FROM A SOURCE.  Announcement:  Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), operated by Bechtel BWXT Idaho, LLC (BBWI) under contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) is soliciting a written indication of interest from industrial partners capable of developing and implementing BBWI proprietary methods for recovery of daughter isotopes from a source and delivering the recovered daughter isotopes to the medical community for clinical trials, therapeutic treatments or both, and who are interested in entering into a license agreement, research and development agreement, or both, for the purpose of developing and commercializing a method to recover daughter isotopes for human therapeutic applications.  License terms would include an up-front licensing payment, minimum annual royalties and a running royalty based on a percentage of sales.  A research and development agreement would be under a standard CRADA arrangement with an option for licensing subject inventions.   Note:  THIS IS NOT A COMMITMENT BY BBWI TO ENTER INTO EITHER A LICENSE AGREEMENT OR A COOPERATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT FOR THESE TECHNOLOGIES WITH ANY COMPANY.   A description of the technology follows:  INEEL scientists have identified two distinct proprietary methods for recovery of daughter isotopes from more than 10 metric tons of source material.  Both methods result in the recovery of Actinium 225 from the source material, which includes mixed thorium isotopes containing about 40 grams of Thorium 229.  More details will be available to qualified companies under a nondisclosure agreement.  The successful company will be expected to be capable of a) funding a pilot-plant development of one or both methods, b) funding development and operation of a commercial process for recovery of Actinium 225 from this source, and c) providing Actinium 225 to the medical community for use in clinical trials, therapeutic treatments or both.  Note: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing BBWI's Methods for Recovery of Daughter Isotopes from a Source should provide a written statement of interest which includes the following: 1) company name and address; 2) the name, address, telephone number and e-mail address for a point of contact; 3) a brief description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology; and 4) a brief description of how the company might commercialize this technology.  The statement of interest should be made by US mail or e-mail and should be received within 30 days of publication of this opportunity at the following address: John R. Snyder, Ph.D., Advisory Account Executive, Technology Outreach, BBWI, P.O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3805. E-mail is snydjr@inel.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY TO PRE-QUALIFY VENDORS. THERE IS NOT A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The United States Secretary of the Senate (the Secretary) is seeking qualified sources for multiple award of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts to develop several multimedia presentations for posting on the Senate web site.  These presentations will enhance the user experience and provide an exceptional educational experience.  Development assistance is sought to create web-based multimedia presentations on the following subjects: the political cartoons of Puck; Lily Spandorf drawings of the making of the movie Advise and Consent; the papers of Issac Bassett; the Senate Desks; and a revision of the current virtual tour of the Capitol.  Each presentation is a separate and unique undertaking and will be awarded on a task-order basis.  The Secretary has estimated that the individual tasks may range from $5,000 to $20,000. GENERAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS 1) All pieces will be 800 x 600 pixels.  Existing graphics may need to be redesigned to fit. 2) Video segments will be streamed from a U.S. Senate provided video server. 3) Concept and functionality must be approved by the U.S. Senate prior to the building of Flash applications, or any other type of multimedia presentation. 4) In those cases where original presentations are being converted to web-based technology, pieces will remain conceptually similar to their original form. 5) Where needed, the U.S. Senate will provide suitable artwork in digital form. 6) The "target machine" will be a Pentium 4 with 256MB of RAM and 24 bit color.  Qualified sources shall demonstrate their ability to perform the following Task 001 in their responses to this notice: Task 001 TAKE THE PUCK CHALLENGE.  Several years ago, the Office of Senate Curator developed an interactive computer exhibit based on the Senate-related political cartoons that appeared in the 19th-century satirical magazine Puck.  The interactive exhibit, the “Puck challenge,” used puzzles, quizzes, and graphic activities to familiarize the audience with Puck cartoons and the events they satirized.  The exhibit used touch screen technology and was developed in Macromedia Director for display in a Kiosk in the Capitol.   Development assistance is being sought to convert the original Director presentation into a web-presentable format (e.g., Flash, Shockwave, or other suggested formats) for posting on www.senate.gov.  The original presentation and all the accompanying graphical elements will be made available to the selected contractor.  Suggestions for improvements or enhancements to the original design and functionality will be welcomed.  Responses to this sources sought request are due to the POC no later than June 11, 2004 at 12:00 Noon EDT. Responses must include a brief technical proposal addressing the sample Task 001 and a cost proposal to include the estimated cost to perform the sample task and hourly rates for staff for use in the ID/IQ contract. To respond you must also provide the following: 1) General Information about your firm * Company Name: * Address: * Point of Contact Telephone Number E-mail address * GSA Schedule Number (if applicable) * DUNS Number * Tax ID Number; 2) A statement indicating an interest and a description of the capability to perform the tasks; 3) A statement of relevant experience; and 4) Five past performance references for similar tasks with a contact name, title, and phone number and a brief synopsis of the services provided by the Contractor. The past performance must demonstrate your firm’s ability to provide the required services to perform Task 001 and similar projects.   The response should not exceed twenty (20) pages. Qualified sources must provide their responses via e-mail to Acquisitions@saa.senate.gov. Sources responding to this notice and deemed qualified by the Secretary will be awarded IDIQ contract. The Secretary will issue Task 001 under one of the contracts.  The subject line of the email message should be “2004-S-055 Multimedia Services”.  If suitable responses are received from qualified sources, the Secretary anticipates award of a contract or contracts in July 2004. TELEPHONE OR E-MAIL REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL NOT BE HONORED. THE U.S. SENATE OR THE SECRETARY WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COSTS FOR THE PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. REQUESTS FOR HARD COPIES OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL NOT BE HONORED. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT AND IS THE ONLY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE U.S. SECRETARY OF THE SENATE OR U.S. SENATE.

GPO is requesting information in order to benchmark the types of services that private vendors provide as well as how much is charged for each type of service. This information will be used to determine which direction is the most efficient for the future of ID’s distribution services.  ID’s current distribution facilities include: Warehouse in Laurel, MD; the Pueblo Documents Distribution Center in Pueblo, CO; the Depository Distribution Division at our Washington, DC headquarters.  


Information Dissemination’s Current Distribution Facilities

Laurel: 
The Laurel Distribution Center receives, stores, processes and ships publications and subscriptions for GPO customers through ID’s Sales and Reimbursable Programs.  Stock is stored in anticipation of orders that are received at our Headquarters in Washington DC via phone, fax, mail, or online from the general public. 

Pueblo Documents Distribution Center:  
ID’s Pueblo Documents Distribution Center (PuDDC) provides storage and distribution services for Federal agencies including the Federal Consumer Information Center (General Services Administration).  Most of the stock is stored in anticipation of requests from the general public, which are received via phone, fax, mail, or online through the Federal Consumer Information Center.      

Depository Distribution Division:
ID’s Depository Distribution Division is responsible for receiving and distributing government publications to Federal Depository Libraries and processing library claims.  There are approximately 1,280 depository libraries throughout the United States.  Each library determines which publications they receive through an item selection process.  Once stock is received, the selected items are sent out to the requesting libraries.  Residual copies are kept on-hand to satisfy claims for a period of 60 days after original ship date.

<SUBJECT>A -- On-Board Turbine Blade Health Sensor
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for a non-developmental engine diagnostic system for monitoring blade tip frequency response in the Pratt & Whitney F100 engine.  The United States Air Force operates F-15 and F-16 fighter aircraft powered by the F100 engine.  These turbine engines have multi-stage rotating components that have unique vibratory responses that shift due to changes in the operating environment related to airflow, blade tip clearances, engine speed, or component damage, etc. The diagnostic system must serve to detect and warn of frequency response changes due to propagation of pre-critical LCF and/or transient HCF component cracks by fusing real-time state awareness sensor data with advanced predictive algorithms.

This diagnostic system must be non-developmental. Potential respondents must have demonstrated the system capability on a fielded system for a multi-aircraft fleet. The system must be self-contained and not require integration with an existing engine control or monitoring system. It must maintain operability in the engine-operating environment including temperatures up to 1500C, pressures up to 10 Mpa, and vibration up to15g.

Potential respondents should possess the technical ability to perform an advanced diagnostic system verification task. This task includes the F100 engine system integration, related fabrication and assembly, performance parameter verification, data analysis, and reporting.  The Government does not presently intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, but wants to obtain market information or capabilities for planning purposes. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Submission of a response is voluntary, and 
participants will not be compensated.  Routine communications concerning this special notice should be directed to Brian Allport, Contract Negotiator, at (937) 656-9832, or Bruce Miller, Contracting Officer, at (937) 255-2643. 

Potential sources should submit information describing their non-developmental engine diagnostic system to Brian Allport, AFRL/PRKB, by e-mail (brian.allport@wpafb.af.mil) by 14 June 2004.  Submissions should not exceed 8 pages in length.

<SUBJECT>R -- Automated Data Collection Security
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI). It is not a solicitation, not an announcement of a solicitation, and not a notice of intent to later issue a solicitation. Do not attempt to request or register to receive a solicitation at this time as that is not the purpose of this announcement.  No vendor(s) will be selected for a contract award based on their response to this RFI, it is for market research and procurement planning purposes only. US-CERT was established in September 2003 as a public-private partnership charged with improving computer security preparedness and response to cyber attacks in the United States. As an institution, US-CERT is responsible for: analyzing and reducing cyber threats and vulnerabilities; disseminating cyber threat warning information; coordinating incident response activities. US-CERT is the nation's focal point for preventing, protecting against, and responding to cyber security and vulnerabilities. US-CERT interacts with all federal agencies, private industry, the research community, state and local governments, and others on a 24x7 basis to disseminate reasoned and actionable cyber security information. To provide security information to the public, US-CERT: integrates content contributed by numerous organizations from both the public and private sectors; aggregates and analyzes the various types of data provided by contributing organizations; serves as the focal point for promoting common and comprehensive analysis of security trends and risks; maintains quality control standards and works to ensure technical accuracy as well as timeliness. 
This RFI is related to automated data collection and analysis methods. This information is necessary in order to obtain a more complete picture and find out what capabilities currently exist in the marketplace. Within the Cyber Security community, there are vendors and organizations that collect, analyze and distribute early warning and analytical information for a variety of purposes and clients. US-CERT would like to hear from organizations or vendors with current, functioning early warning collection efforts. In addition, and in order to have a more complete picture of capabilities and assets, the US-CERT requests the following information of existing operations (keeping in mind constraints of National Security classified information and proprietary restrictions): 1. Describe your existing early warning capability? 2. What are the sources of data you are currently collecting (e.g., firewall, IDS, syslogs, connectivity, etc.) as part of your early warning capability?
3. What volume of data do you collect currently and what is your volume capability? 4. How are you providing analysis of the data?
5. What correlation methods do you use? 6. How is the data presented and visualized? 7. What types of early warnings are provided to your current customers and what is the communications method (i.e., email, phone, pager, etc.)?
8. “How early is early,” i.e., turn around time for collection, to analysis, to client warning? Please provide your response to Robert.Pate@dhs.gov. Your responses will be treated as confidential and your organization will not be publicly connected with the information you provide. (One or more support contractors may be utilized as subject-matter-expert technical consultants in reviewing your RFI submissions.  Please note that each support contractor’s employee having access to responses submitted in response to this RFI will be required to sign a non-disclosure statement.)

U.S. COAST GUARD, HU-25 ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS REPAIR, STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES: 

BACKGROUND: The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate in salt laden environments.  The engine electrical components are essential to the engine control and distribution system utilized on the Coast Guard fleet of aircraft.

OBJECTIVE: The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain the services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to repair and provide complete, ready-to-install engine electrical components for the HU-25 that are certified for flight with an FAA 8130-3 Flight Worthiness document.  The Coast Guard desires a Turn-Around-Time of no greater than 180 days from time of material receipt at contractor’s facility to prevent Aircraft On Ground (AOG) supply issues.

REQUIREMENTS: A.  Repaired components must comply with the current Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) specifications, drawings, Service Bulletins, and performance requirements as set forth in the OEM technical specifications.  The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform the services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to; required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, serviceable and non-serviceable parts storage, preservation, packaging, shipping, etc.  Components must be hermetically sealed in anti-static plastic with desiccant to maintain humidity levels at 10% or less.  They must be packaged in a sealed container with solid core, form-fitting foam, and a minimum of 2.5 inches thick on all surfaces.  The use of chipped foam, Styrofoam "peanuts", shredded paper, or other similar material is not acceptable.  The packaging must protect components during normal ground or air transportation and during storage in a climate controlled facility for up to 2 years.  Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center (ARSC) HU-25 Product Line and the winning offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.  B. To meet the Coast Guard’s objectives, the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria: 1.Technical: (a) Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling, fixtures and parts to meet current OEM specifications as referenced in above Paragraph A. (b) Provide a written Performance Metrics Plan.  (c) Provide evidence of, and ability to maintain, a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.  2.Past Performance (a).  Provide documentation of having performed repair of similar or like items.  (b). Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years.  Include references’ name, company, phone number, and e-mail address. 

Service Bulletins: All service bulletins if not previously accomplished, shall be identified to the Contracting Officer.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining service bulletins.  Upon receipt of a component requiring incorporation of such service bulletins, the contractor shall prepare a firm fixed price proposal IAW instructions listed below.  Service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number configurations, which supercede the previous configuration.  In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number may be added to the contract.  The contractor shall notify and request disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer for superceded parts, which have been removed and replaced by new part number configurations. Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the Contractor shall submit, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notification, a firm-fixed price proposal for an incremental charge to be assessed each time the service bulletin is incorporated in a component.  The proposal shall contain a breakdown of material and labor costs including hours, labor categories, labor rates, and applicable mark ups.  The incremental charge agreed to for incorporation of a service bulletin shall apply only to those components into which the Contractor incorporates a required service bulletin, not those into which the service bulletin has been previously incorporated.  Upon agreement of an incremental charge and issuance of a contract modification to reflect this change, the service bulletin shall be incorporated into each subsequent component received at the repair facility if said service bulletin has not already been incorporated.  When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the contract.  The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is required.

APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS:  The price proposal should include sufficient detail to allow for complete evaluation, e.g. work breakdown, structure, material description, prices, labor categories, rates and hours.  Data availability: OEM Technical data, Service Bulletins, drawings and specifications are proprietary and cannot be provided by the U.S. Coast guard; Coast Guard specific Coast Guard Technical Orders (CGTO’s) and ARSC drawings can be acquired through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refiling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The purchase request number is FQ481441120300, and is being solicitation issued as a sole source request for quotation. The proposed action is for services for which the government intends to solicit and award a contract with one organization under the authority of FAR Part 6.302. This project consists of matching funds from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for partnering with the local non-profit organization Tampa Bay Watch. Tampa Bay Watch is selected as the sole source contractor due to the funding and technical requirements associated with this project. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-22. Description of Services. Shoreline stabilization project consisting of construction of a shallow wave-energy barrier. Requirement: Provide all research and engineering management, labor, materials, equipment and transportation to install a shallow wave energy dissipation barrier approximately 800 ft long parallel to the shoreline. The barrier shall be constructed between 50-150 feet offshore where the water is typically 1.5 to 2.0 feet deep at high tide. All work shall be in compliance with the statement of work. 1.0  OBJECTIVE; The southeastern shoreline along MacDill AFB is rapidly eroding. The rate of erosion has been estimated to be approximately one foot per year. Shoreline erosion may be due to a number of factors including an increase in the size and volume of commercial ship traffic through Hillsborough and Tampa Bays.  Shoreline erosion has been observed at many locations throughout coastal areas around Tampa Bay.  Due to the steady shoreline erosion at MacDill, approximately 3,800 square feet of beach along a half mile of remnant coastal shoreline is lost annually.  Some of the natural resources along the shoreline that will be lost soon include historic Live Oaks (100+ years old), mature Black Mangroves, and dense shore grass stands.  In addition to the natural resource losses resulting from the disappearing shoreline, an eligible cultural resources site is also being impacted by the continuing shoreline erosion.  The Gadsden Point site (MacDill Site 8 Hi50) is located in the northern portion of the southeastern shoreline area, and it too is rapidly eroding.  Erosion of the shoreline in the area around the Gadsden Point site resulted in the discovery of Native American remains around 1994.  Continued erosion of the shoreline around the Gadsden Point site could result in exposure of more archeological resources.  The site contains important Native American burial remains and middens that may experience new exposure almost daily. Stabilization of the MacDill AFB southeastern shoreline may be completed through construction of a shallow wave-energy barrier constructed of concrete "reef-balls" or other shallow wave-energy dissipation barriers.  The pre-fabricated reef-balls are designed to reduce wave energy and encourage establishment of oyster and mussel beds/bars.  MacDill AFB has completed a demonstration project in the northern portion of the southeastern-most shoreline of MacDill AFB to determine which ‘reef-ball’ configuration was most effective at reducing wave energy and stabilizing the shoreline.  The demonstration project (known as Phase I) created a shallow wave-energy dissipation barrier approximately 800 feet long parallel to the shoreline.  The barrier was constructed approximately 100 feet off-shore where the water is 1.5 to 2.0 feet deep at high tide.  MacDill AFB received matching funds from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for both Phase I and Phase II of the shoreline stabilization project (Phase II has been contracted).  Phase III will very likely receive a matching grant from USFWS, as the first two phases did.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for non-commercial services prepared in accordance with the format, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. Provide Professional Services and Equipment for Computer Simulation of E ffects of VARQ Flood Control on Fisheries Resources in the Kootenai River, Koocanusa Reservoir, Flathead River, and Hungry Horse Reservoir.   The contractor will furnish all services, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment necessary to conduct the tasks  listed below to Seattle District necessary to meet the above-stated objectives within the time frame provided.  In performance of this work, the contractor and any subcontractors should rely in part on existing information as provided by the Corp.  Meetin gs: The Contractor shall be expected to participate in one kick-off teleconference meeting, followed by monthly teleconferences for progress updates and discussion. Tasks:  Tropic responses in Koocanusa and Hungry Horse reservoirs resulting from various da m operation strategies will be analyzed using the quantitative biological models (LRMOD and HRMOD) developed by Montana Fish Wildlife & Parks and Montana State University (Marotz et al 1996); both are public domain computer programs.  The models perform da ily simulations using a daily reservoir inflow schedule, plus either a schedule of daily reservoir elevations or daily dam discharges.  Additional files mimic flow requirements for Kootenai white sturgeon, bull trout and other species of special concern as  called for in the 2000 BiOps.  Once the hydrologic mass balance is established, biological productivity (primary through tertiary production) in the reservoirs will be calculated.  Model output includes primary productivity, zooplankton production, aquati c insect emergence, terrestrial insect deposition and fish growth (kokanee at Libby; westslope cutthroat at Hungry Horse).  Certain aspects of the original model will be updated to simulate current dam operating practices e.g. VARQ flood control, flow augm entation for fish restoration and seasonal limits to dam discharge.  Biological productivity in the Kootenai River would be assessed using files of daily dam discharge and water temperature. Discharge hydrographs resulting from alternative dam operating scenarios can be ranked using existing wetted perimeter / discharge rel ationships and comparisons of varial zone area.  Mass balance equations in LRMOD estimate Libby Dam discharge, or use file data to calculate river flows at Bonners Ferry.  The river model can be reconfigured to simulate the most recent tiered flow strategy  for Kootenai white sturgeon, and summertime flow augmentation for bull trout and anadromous fish in the lower Columbia River.  Fish operations should be consistent with the 2000 BiOps and clearly defined.  Reservoir and river biota would be similarly anal yzed using the Hungry Horse Reservoir Model (HRMOD).  The model can be reconfigured to mimic VARQ flood control and summertime flow augmentation for anadromous fish in the lower Columbia River and bull trout.  Fish operations should be clearly defined usin g criteria and assumptions contained in hydro-regulation modeling results provided to the contractor.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690, which is matched to SIC code 8748 .  This is for a Base Item, plus 2 optional items.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 02 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR 20K CRYOGENIC COOLING SYSTEM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to:  (1) provide answers to questions that were received, (2) provide a notice for a site visit for the existing equipment and (3) extend the closing date of the solicitation. QUESTION:  MSFC Solicitation Document Request:	MSOP-FA-XRCF-472 (Ref. MSFC SOL 8-4200061951, "20K Cyrogenic Cooling System") Please advise me where the documents below can be obtained or downloaded. ANSWER: MSFC-SPEC-1238 Thermal Vacuum Bakeout Specification for Contamination Sensitive Hardware. This document is located at the bottom of the webpage.        http://optics.nasa.gov/facilities/xraycal_contamcontrol.html	    MSFC-SPEC-1443 Outgassing Test For Non-metallic Materials Associated with Sensitive Optical Surfaces in a Space Environment This document is located at the bottom of the webpage.		 http://optics.nasa.gov/facilities/xraycal_contamcontrol.html	     MWI-6430.1 Lifting Equipment and Operations  This document is located at: https://webpub.nis.nasa.gov/directives/directives.htm MPG 5340.1 MSFC Clean Room Procedures This document is located at: https://webpub.nis.nasa.gov/directives/directives.htm MSOP-FA-XRCF-472   XRCF Standard Operating Procedure Clean Room System.  This is not available online at this time. A hardcopy can be sent on request. The requirements in this document that  are very similar to MPG 5340.1 for the scope of this work.	 QUESTION:  What is the distance for the location of the new 1620S refrigerator vessel to the chamber feedthrough for the purpose of costing cryogenic transfer lines.	  ANSWER:  Approximately 15 feet. QUESTION:  What is the distance for the location of the new RSX compressor to the 1620S plant?	 ANSWER:  The exact location of the compressor has not been determined.	Our current compressor is 150 feet from the 1620S.	This would be a close estimate to the distance between the new units.	This long distance keeps us from sending cold gas to the compressor while running at temperatures above 100K. QUESTION:  Is LN2 available and feedthrough port, to be used inside the chamber for heat stationing of objects?  ANSWER: LN2 is available in the chamber.  QUESTION:  The assumption is that there is enough feed through ports available for the new cryogenic lines without adding new penetrations into the chamber.	 ANSWER:The port is available approximately 15 feet from the 1620S. QUESTION:  Para 6.3.3. A valved helium supply and return port for the small chamber.  Does this refer to bayonet connections at the refrigerator's interface?  That is an additional two bayonets is required and two valves are required in the coldbox? Or are these additional supply and return ports and valves part of the cryogenic transfer lines system?   ANSWER:  This is the correct answer.  In addition to the bayonet connections at the refrigerator we need another set of valved bayonets between the refrigerator and the chamber port.  This will allow us to valve out the large shroud and run a smaller shroud we have in separate chamber.  You would only provide the bayonet connection. We have a flex line to run to the small chamber.	Our current system is configured in this manner.  A drawing is attached  QUESTION:  How do we obtain a copy of NASA Marshall documents?MWI-6430.1, MPG 5340.1, and MSOP-FA-XRCF-472 RE 5.1 and 7.2.2.  ANSWER:  The web addresses for these documents was provided in a previously answered question. QUESTION:  Where is the kick-off meeting to be held? ANSWER:  NASA/MSFC, Building 4718, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL 35812 on Thursday, May 20, 2004 at 9:00AM CDT.  Further details are provided below concerning the site visit to MSFC. QUESTION:  RE 5.2.2  What codes and/or standards are applicable to the piping systems and also the shrouds?  ANSWER:  Pressure Piping Systems will be designed per ASME B31.1(Power Piping).  You can refer to MPG 8823.2B Pressure Systems Guidelines also.	You can find this  :https://webpub.nis.nasa.gov/directives/directives.htm or https://repository.msfc.nasa.gov/directive/directives.htm QUESTION:  RE 5.2.2.2 What is the required factor of safety under yield and ultimate loads?  ANSWER:     F.S. = 2.0 on Yield Strength 	    F.S. = 3.0 on Utimate Tensile Strength 	    F.S. = 3.0 on Buckling 	    F.S. = 2.0 on Tipover QUESTION:  RE 6.3.3  Are there any available ports on the chamber that may be used for adding cryogenic feedthroughs?	 ANSWER:  The port will be made available approximately 15 feet from the 1620S.	Minimum port size if one common port is available is14".  Minimum port size if two ports are available is 6" each. QUESTION:  RE 6.3.3  What specific requirements are there for interfacing with existing gas management system?   ANSWER:  We would like to run our existing refrigerator with the new compressor in case of failure of our existing compressor and vise versa otherwise both systems will run independently of each other.  The new shroud and existing shroud will not be configured together as one unit running on both refrigerators.  Each refrigerator will run its own shroud.  We did want to have the capability to attach the new shroud to the old shroud to give us flexibility of shroud configurations.  QUESTION:  RE 6.3.3   What is the size of existing Helium buffer tank that we are to duplicate size on new refrigerator?   ANSWER:  Our current tank is 1000 gallon.  The refrigerator manufacturer should have a recommendation for the tank size. QUESTION:  RE 6.2.4.1  How many diodes are required?  ANSWER:  Approximately 45 diode location bosses are required.  MSFC will provide and install the diodes, wiring harness, feedthru, and readouts. Vendor will just provide the diode QUESTION:  Is there a requirement for feedthrus for the new diodes?   ANSWER:  A feed thru is available and will be provided by MSFC.      QUESTION:  Is there a requirement for readouts for the	new diodes?  ANSWER:  The readouts will be provided by MSFC also.   QUESTION:  RE 6.2.4.2  What is battery limits for the lighting requirement?  Is there a requirement for power Feedthru for the new lights.  Can the new lights be  integrated with existing lighting circuits (if any) in the chamber?   Is there a lighting panel in the vicinity for  powering the lights. ANSWER:  We will provide the lighting power(110V) supply to the shroud.  You shall provide a vacuum compatible plug at the end of the harness.   A battery backup is not necessary.  QUESTION:  RE 6.5 For materials and assemblies requiring vacuum bake-out,  such as MLI, is the vendor required to perform the bake-out or can we assume that MSFC will participate in that requirement?   ANSWER: MSFC has the bakeout facility and may elect to perform this bakeout. This requirement should be bid as a separate line item.   QUESTION:  Does this project carry a government priority rating?  ANSWER:  No QUESTION:  We will want to send a hardcopy of our proposal in addition to the e-mailed proposal.  What is the full overnight mailing address,	building number, mailstop, etc.....?  ANSWER:  The full overnight mailing address is as follows:  NASA/MSFC, Central Receiving, Building 4471, Attention:  PS33-H/Bobby J. Holden, MSFC, AL 35812. QUESTION:  We are currently interviewing prospective subcontractors for installation of the Linde BOC Helium refrigerator and on site labor help in installing the shroud, plumbing, helium supply manifold, refrigerator piping, chamber feed thru, and MLI blankets.  Do you have a recommendation or a list of qualified vendors familiar with your procedures who have performed satisfactorily for you?   ANSWER:  The contractor that built and installed our existing shroud was PSI who is no longer in business.  Suggest talking with the refrigerator manufacture for suggestions on installing their system. SPECIAL NOTICE:  A site visit to see the existing equipment is scheduled at NASA/MSFC, Building 4718, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL 35812 on Thursday, May 20, 2004 at 9:00AM CDT.

1.  Background:

    a.  Requiring Organization:  The organization requiring the services outlined in the SOW is:

Navy Supply Information Systems Activity
Code 9322
5450 Carlisle Pike
P.O. Box 2010
Mechanicsburg, PA 17055-0787

b.	Background. 

As part of the Navy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Convergence Program, the Navy has selected SAP’s Warehouse Management System (WMS) to manage their warehouse operations.   The Navy desires that this single ERP system have processes consistent with the objective of normalizing the four ERP Pilots (NEMAIS, SMART, SIGMA and CABRILLO), which is to converge logistics business processes for the entire Navy.  The role of the converged WMS will be to normalize the Navy’s warehousing business processes on a global basis.   The Navy ERP system will be rolled out to select sites within a couple of years.

NAVSUP would like to implement Decentralized Warehouse Management System at our NAVSUP partner sites at least a year in advance of when Global Template (GT) 2.0 (which includes the functionality required to run at a Partner Site) is rolled out, allowing the early shutdown of the applications supporting warehouse management, saving the Navy millions in information technology (IT) costs to host and maintain.  Additionally, it is anticipated that the business process improvements resulting from implementing SAP’s best practice warehouse management will save the Navy a substantial amount as well.

Today, the 40 Navy Partner sites perform their warehouse management functions for the Navy owned material using several UADPS subsystems/applications (running on both IBM Mainframe and Tandem). These systems collectively communicate warehouse information to and from the IM system.  Since these sites are not currently part of the initial rollout of Converged ERP, the Navy would like to replace the legacy warehouse management applications (residing on Tandem) with DWMS. The SAP DWMS module will initially interface with our legacy systems, which will continue to perform the Inventory Management (IM) function.  Eventually, the SAP DWMS will interface with the ‘main’ SAP for the performance of the IM function.  Having this piece of the ERP solution already in place prior to the completion of the total “converged” Navy ERP solution will facilitate and mitigate the risk of implementing the final Navy solution.

Implementing DWMS before ERP Convergence will enable a highly visible early ERP success while facilitating and mitigating the risk of the Navy ERP “final solution”. Additionally, early implementation of SAP DWMS will allow NAVSUP retail partner sites to shut down those U2 applications supporting warehouse management, provide an enhanced and more efficient capability, and provide a significant return on investment (ROI).  Additionally, it enables us to move forward by complying with the DOD Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) functionality mandate.

Early implementation of SAP DWMS will offer Navy the opportunity to implement efficiency-enhancing technologies and processes in its warehouses, just as the converged ERP implementation will offer the opportunity to implement them for the logistics community as a whole.  One of the biggest advantages to implementing DWMS in advance of the ERP Converged system is that it enables the Navy logistics IT community to implement incrementally versus using a “big bang” approach.

Additionally, it is anticipated that implementing SAP DWMS at the NAVSUP partner sites will significantly compress the schedule for implementing the converged centralized ERP by pre-converting the 40 sites.  It is also anticipated that once DWMS is installed at all partner sites, groups of National Stock Numbers (NSNs) can be moved globally versus site by site. 

2.  Scope of Work to be Performed:  This SOW solicits contractor support to assist in the development of a cost and schedule estimate to implement DWMS at the 40 Navy Partner Sites.

Site Visit Dates and Times:
19 May 2004, 9:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.
24 May 2004, 7:30 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.
All potential offerors must coordinate site visit time with the Contracting Office.
Send request via e-mail to toxie.courtney@maxwell.af.mil or call (334) 953-3516.  
Proposal due date has changed from 10 May 2004 to 9 June 2004, 3:00 p.m. CST.
Equipment list and schematics/drawings will be provided at the site visit.

Q&A
1.  What is the size of the lens in the current Hilight 5100dp projector?
	Answer: DLP Projection Zoom – 2.5 – 4.0:1
2.  Are you committed to the Polycom VS4000 VTC codec?
	Answer: We are comitted to the Polycom VS
3.  What are the auditorium’s dimensions?
	Answer: Schematics are being digitized and will be provided.
4.  Please verify the projection image dimensions and aspect ratio (4:3 or 16:9)
	Answer: 4:3
5.  In CLIN 002, does the word surround describe the speaker coverage of the type of sound processing desired in the system?
a.	Is there a preference for the type of surround processing requested (Dolby 5.1, Dolby 6.1, Dolby 7.2, or THX Certified)?
Answer: Dolby 5.1.  ADDITIONALLY, audio coverage should be zone controlled to eliminate ‘dead’ spots when using monaural or simple stero audio.
6.  Do you have a list of exisiting equipment that must be de-installed?
	Answer: A list will be provided at the next site visit.
7.  Is an existing equipment list, system drawings or pictures available?
Answer:  Yes.  Original schematics/drawings are being digitized and will be provided.  We do no guarantee 100 percent accuracy of the drawings as many components have been relocated or replaced, but the overall layout of the system hasn’t changed much.
8.  Canera position and relative focal distance will be required to specify appropriate lens.  Please clarify.
Answer: We require 4 cameras in the corners and 1 mounted center rear, just below the booth window.  Currently, there are 2 cameras mounted, 1 center rear, 1 left front (facing stage); we need these replaced and an additional 3 cameras, 2 in the rear corners and 1 on right front (facing stage).  Focal plane 10’ to 160’.
9.  Will caner presets be controlled only from a central controller?  Or, will additional interfaces be required?
	Answer:  Central controller in the control booth only.
10.  The cameras require CV as well as SDI.  Is the SDI for recording only?  Is there a non-linear editor in the future?  Do we need to provide both SDI and Video to al destinations?
	Answer:  Composite NTSC and SDI are both required.
11.  The Video Conference is listed as future but the specification also shows a supplied VS4000 Codec.  Please verify.
Answer: Codec will be part of the install.  We want to ensure integration of the codec into the AV system.  The VTC circuits and service is what the future project is referring to.
12.  Is the 43’ diagonal screen standard video format or 16x9?
	Answer: 4x3 video format.
13.  Is there a specification for projector brightness or desired lumens at screen?  What should we consider as ambient light levels for the auditorium?
	Answer:  High quality display at full room lighting.  MINIMUM 5000 lumen.
14.  What should we consider for the projector’s resolution (XGA, WXGA, SXGA)?
Answer:  SVGA or XGA at 1024x768, 60-80hz at 32m colors (SVGA mentioned for backward/downward compatiblity only).  We always like to keep downward compatiblity.  XGA is MINIMUM however.
15.  The listed 88’ of throw distance is to what location?  Is this rear or front projection?  Ceiling or Floor/Shelf installation?
Answer:  Projector is front projection mounted in a rack in the booth, shooting through booth glass to a screen on back of stage.
16.  There is mention of existing equipment and racks.  Will a list of the existing components be available?
Answer: Yes.  A list of components, identifying replacement or reuse will be provided at the next site visit.
17.  Where is the control booth?  Will an operator always be here, or is there a need for the speaker to control the system.
Answer: There will be an operator whenever the system in use.  No controls from the podium/stage are required.
18.  What is the purpose of the stage monitor speakers?
Answer:  I’m not sure what a “stage monitor speaker” is referring to.  There may be some confusion between 2 requirements here.  We need 2 – 21” LCD monitors mounted on the front of the stage, facing the presenter on stage.  These are for use as confidence monitors, teleprompter, etc.  There are no stage speakers required.  On another issue, we requested condensing microphones also mounted on the stage to facilitate the booth being able to pick up sound from unmicrophoned presenters both on stage and speaking from in front of the stage.
19.  Should carts be provided for the Video and Computer monitors on the stage monitors?
	Answer:  Monitors will be mounted to the stage and be able to be easily removed.
20.  Will both sourround and distributed audio system be required?
	Answer:  Yes.
21.  How will the microphones be used in the audience area?
Answer:  Replacement of 10 wireless microphones is requested.  6 handheld wireless and 4 belt pack wireless microphones are currently in use.
22.  Is site visit mandatory?
	Answer: Yes
23.  How will technical evaluation be done on the sound system?
Answer: All offerors will be required to provide a diagnostic of the sound system with proposal.
24.  The specification stipulates a new console.  How large, how many sections does it have now?  Are we replacing or modifying?
Answer:  We currently have no console.  It’s more of a room length counter with many of the components un-mounted and spread throughout the room.  Currently, operators have to run all over the room to operate equipment during events.

Modification of the current countertop could be an option, but ergonomics may pose a problem.
Desired end product:
1.  Puts most controls and common component access within arm reach of a single technician.  Common components defined – main controller, sound mixer, comera controls, PC, lighting control, VCR/DVD, audio devices, etc. (the things commonly requiring human interface).
2.  The components/controls should be mounted in an ergonomic/aesthetic fashion (not just stacked on the counter), but accessible/removable for maintenance.  Cable management should be accomplished to hide most wiring and cabling.
3.  Ideally, the console will have room for 2 operators, but designed for easy accessiblity to components when there is only 1 operator.
4.  Both projectors are in the center of the booth.  The new console will need to be on the left side of the room when facing the stage.  There is a 162” x 93” usable area available for the new console.  The current countertop has a few built in cabinets below that could pose leg-room problems if utilized.
5.  Here are 2 rough examples of old/new layouts.  By no means is this a technical design, only a rough idea for a new console.

<DESC>This is Amendment 0006 to combined synopsis/solicitation W58RGZ-04-R-0547.  The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the evaluation weights for the technical area of the best value evaluation.  The evaluation weight of the proposed delivery schedu le was inadvertently omitted.  In the technical area, there are four evaluated elements:  Proposed Delivery Schedule, Proposed Training Plan, Proposed Logistics Support Plan and Airworthiness.  Each of these elements are equal to each other in terms of rel ative importance.  The proposal due date remains unchanged as 21 May 2004, 4:00 (Central Time).
