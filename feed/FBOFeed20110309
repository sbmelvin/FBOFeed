<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals.  The Bureau of Reclamation Snake River Area Office intends to issue a sole source contract with the BURNS PAIUTE TRIBE to eradicate the invasive brook trout from bull trout habitat at High Lake in Oregon.
Brook trout threats, along with other environmental and anthropogenic factors, have imperiled the native in the Upper Malheur and led to the population being classified as having an extremely heightened risk of extinction.
It has also been deemed necessary to achieve a reduction or elimination of threats from brook trout interaction in the Upper Malheur prior to restoration of.  Full recovery of Malheur River bull trout is therefore contingent upon minimizing the threats posed by brook trout interaction in the basin.  
Reducing the effect of brook trout on bull trout is strategized under Objective 4.1 of the subbasin plan (2004).  The Burns Paiute Tribe has completed phases I and II in the past years and is looking to complete tasks III-V over the next three years.
RECIPIENT INVOLVEMENT An intensive removal effort will occur at High Lake for two weeks each year.  Efforts will be timed to coincide with when brook trout begin to stage for fall spawning (mid-September).  Gillnets will be utilized to surround the two small bays known to be spawning areas in High Lake.  Additional gillnets will be strategically placed in areas of brook trout movement.  Gillnets will be deployed everyday in the mid-afternoon with catch retrieved the following morning.  Keeping nets deployed during this time of day will disrupt brook trout movements to and from redds and lead to higher catch rates.    The gillnet left to overwinter will be retrieved as soon as the site is accessible the following spring. 

RECLAMATION INVOLVEMENTReclamation will be responsible for funding phases III-V of the project, for the next three years.  
No substantial involvement on the part of Reclamation is anticipated for the successful completion of the objectives to be funded by this award.  It is anticipated that Reclamation's involvement will consist of standard federal stewardship responsibilities such as monitoring project performance, technical assistance at the request of the recipient, etc.  
Parties who believe they have knowledge sufficient to respond may e-mail their firm's qualifications to the following address.  mday@usbr.gov   No phone or fax inquiries will be allowed.

1.1   The intent of this solicitation is to select one contractor to provide professional Design Build /Architect Engineer (DB/AE) services per attached Scope of Work (SOW) for:  Project #529-311, Domiciliary Extended Stay In Unit Replacement.

1.2   The Government intends to use the "Best Value" tradeoff process source selection approach in accordance with FAR 15.101-1. Award will be made to the responsive responsible offeror whose offer in conformance with this solicitation, results in the best value to the Government, price plus other factors considered. Award of this contract is subject to the availability of funds in accordance with FAR 52.232-18, "Availability of Funds." The Contracting Officer will award a firm fixed price contract to the responsive responsible offeror whom the Source Selection Authority determines conforms to the solicitation, is fair and reasonable and offers the best overall value to the Government, all factors considered. The Government reserves the right to accept other than the lowest priced offer or to reject all offers.

2. Submittal of offers.

2.1   Offerors submitting proposals for this project should limit submissions to data essential for evaluation of proposals so that a minimum of time and monies will have been expended in preparing information required herein.  However, in order to be effectively and equitably evaluated, the proposals must include information sufficiently detailed to clearly describe the offeror's experience, technical approach, and management capabilities to successfully complete the project.  Proposals should follow in the order of sequence set forth in the Request For Proposal (RFP).  Information provided out of sequence may not be evaluated and may result in the offeror's disqualification from award. Requirements stated in this RFP are minimums.  Innovative, creative or cost-saving proposals that meet or exceed the requirements are encouraged and will be rated accordingly.  Any betterments and/or deviations from requirements should be clearly noted and justified in the proposal.

2.2   Offerors must comply with the detailed instructions for the format and content of the proposal; proposals that do not comply with the detailed instructions for the format and content of the proposal may be considered non-responsive and may render the Offeror ineligible for award.

2.3   Offerors shall submit their Technical and Price proposals in two separate envelopes to the Contracting Office at the VA Butler Healthcare System 325 New Castle Road, Butler, PA 16001, Building 1, 3rd floor, Paul Sims, Chief, Contracting, Room 333W.

2.4   Offerors are required to submit a proposal made up of a Technical Proposal and a Price Proposal.  All proposal materials shall be submitted in binders with a table of contents and tabbed section dividers.  The sections should parallel the submission requirements identified below.  

Volume I: Sections 1 - 4
Volume I: Sections 1-4 shall be submitted in original, three copies, and on a compact disk (CD) to the Contracting Officer. Forms for "Prime Contractor Experience", A/E Team Experience", "Prime Contractor Past Performance", and "A/E Team Past Performance" are included in this document.  Offerors must use these forms as part of the submission. Forms must be typed.  Forms that are handwritten will not be evaluated and will result in a lower rating. Proposed innovative suggestions that would be a cost saving are to be indicated in a separate section of the proposal and tabbed "Innovative Suggestions".  These "Innovative Suggestions" must be typed. Failure to place the required submission information under the appropriate tab (factor or sub factor) and format may result in a lower rating if the evaluators cannot readily find the appropriate information.


Volume II: Section 5
Volume II: Section 5 shall be submitted as an original only, and shall be placed in a separate envelope mailed to the Contracting Officer only.

2.5   The construction cost range for this project is $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00.  The Government cannot guarantee that additional funds can be made available for award.  Offerors are under no obligation to approach this cost range.

3.  Proposal Evaluation Process.  

3.1   A Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) comprised of representatives of the Department of Veterans Affairs will evaluate the proposals. The identities of the SSEB personnel are confidential, and any attempt by the offerors to contact these individuals is prohibited. The evaluation will be based on the content of the proposal and any subsequent discussions required, as well as information obtained from other sources, e.g. past performance information. Offerors are advised that the technical evaluation and rating of proposals will be conducted in strict confidence in that technical/quality proposals are reviewed and rated without knowledge of the price offered. The number and identities of offerors are not revealed to anyone who is not involved in the evaluation and award process or to other offerors. Proposals will be evaluated based on the factors described herein, and award will be made to the responsive responsible offeror whose offer in conformance with this solicitation, results in the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered.

3.2   The evaluation process essentially consists of four parts: Proposal Compliance Review with Responsibility Determination, Technical/Quality Evaluation, Price Evaluation and Cost/Technical Trade-off Analysis.

3.2.1   Proposal Compliance Review: This is an initial review to ensure that all required forms and certifications are complete and that both a technical and price proposal were received.

3.2.2   Technical/Quality Evaluation: The SSEB will evaluate and rate those proposals passing the first review, above. Proposals will be evaluated against the Evaluation Factors and Criteria identified in Attachment A.

3.2.3 Price Evaluation: The CO will evaluate price proposals independent of the technical/quality
evaluation.  The SSEB will not have access to price information until completion of the technical/quality evaluation.

3.2.4 Cost/Technical Trade-off Analysis: After all above evaluations are complete, the SSEB will
compare the relative advantages and disadvantages of technical proposals and weigh against the prices.  Note - Statement of Work (SOW) identifies design requirements and project scope. The SSEB will then consider all factors to select the proposal offering the best value to the Government

<DESC><p>SYNOPSIS</p>
<p>The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Metaphor Program on April 13, 2011, in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30 am to 3:00 pm in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on the Metaphor Program to address questions from potential proposers and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.</p>
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS</p>
<p>The Metaphor Program seeks to provide a novel source of deep insights into human cultures via analysis of how language is used. The perspectives shared within a culture play a significant role in determining how the people who comprise that culture view and respond to events. These perspectives are not necessarily explicitly referenced within the culture and the people of the culture may not even be consciously aware of them. In order for an analyst to accurately interpret the actions of people who belong to another culture, he needs to understand the shared perspectives of that culture and also of his own culture. To acquire the requisite level of understanding normally requires substantive personal interactions over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>A metaphor is a linguistic device used within a culture to efficiently communicate a perspective or viewpoint. Metaphors have been studied extensively and have been found to be pervasive in the everyday use of language within a culture. The Metaphor Program will explore the extent to which the linguistic metaphors used within a culture can provide valuable insights into that culture's shared perspectives, and to support cross-cultural analysis.</p>
<p>The first phase of the program will develop and test methods for automating metaphor discovery, semantic definition, mapping and categorization processes. The second phase of the program will apply these methods to produce and compare structured representations of the shared perspectives in multiple cultures and languages. All processing will be in the languages of interest, no processing will be performed on translated materials.</p>
<p>Multidisciplinary teams will be required, with expertise in many technical areas, including but not limited to: social and cognitive psychology, metaphorical language research, natural language processing, cognitive anthropology, cultural analysis, semantics and ontologies. In addition each team will need native language and cultural understanding in each of the cultures and languages addressed in the program.</p>
<p>IARPA anticipates that universities and companies from around the world will participate in this program. Researchers will be able to and are encouraged to publish their findings in publicly available, academic journals.</p>
<p>REGISTRATION INFORMATION</p>
<p>Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm&nbsp;Eastern 6 April 2011 at <a href="https://conference.brtrc.com/Metaphor_pd/overview.aspx">https://conference.brtrc.com/Metaphor_pd/overview.aspx</a>. Directions to the conference facility and other materials are available on the website. No walk-in registrations will be allowed.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 140 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government-issued photo identification to enter the conference. Non-US citizens will be required to submit a visit request form for Foreign Nationals at least 5 business days prior to the conference. The form and submission instructions can be found on the registration website.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Attendees who wish to present organization capabilities for potential teaming opportunities may request to do so by sending an e-mail along with their presentation to dni-iarpa-baa-11-04@ugov.gov. Presentations will be limited to 5 minutes with a maximum of 5 slides (MS PowerPoint or PDF format). Opportunities to present will be limited by time and will therefore be on a first-to-ask basis. Deadline for requests is close of business (5:00pm Eastern) 6 April 2011. It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all materials briefed are appropriately marked and approved for presentation by their organization. The IARPA Program Manager will review and approve all presentations.</p>
<p>This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA nor participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers' Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.</p>
<p>IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference.</p>
<p>Questions concerning conference &amp; registration can be sent to dni-iarpa-events@ugov.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to issue a sole source services contract pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 to SAIC to provide analysis support to the Director of Engineering's Quick Reaction Team using the WILMA Suite of software models. The WILMA Suite provides a quick-turn, architecture-level analysis capability for the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) that MDA leadership uses to inform the White House, Congress and DoD. Access to the WILMA Suite is required to maintain continuity with prior BMDS performance analyses and to avoid disruption of critical analytical support. Part of the application of the WILMA Suite requires it to evolve as the factors in the scenarios change. Portions of the models that make up the WILMA Suite are proprietary to SAIC. Anticipate awarding a one year contract with four, one-year options. Contract award is expected in mid-June 2011. Presuming the government exercises all four options, the estimated value of this contract is $19.5M.

<p>Title: System De-Installation and Re-Installation of CM120 Transmission Electron Microscopes</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOLE/SINGLE SOURCE, NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This sole / single source, non-competitive notice is prepared in accordance with FAR Parts 5 &amp; 13. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Far Part 6 - Competition Requirements, is not applicable to contracts awarded using simplified acquisition procedures of FAR Part 13, not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes the only notice; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>The resultant acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-48 (effective January 31, 2011).</p>
<p>The total estimated amount of this contract is NOT expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold of $150,000.00.</p>
<p>The North American Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this requirement is 334516 and the associated small business size standard is 500 Employees.</p>
<p>THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA) on behalf of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source non competitive basis, to FEI Company, 5350 NE Dawson Creek Drive, Hillsboro, OR 97124, for the de-installation and re-installation of the CM200 Transmission Electron Microscopes into a new room.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based upon the fact that there is FEI Company proprietary technology involved in both the hardware and software that controls the CM120 Transmission Electron Microscope. The procedure for the relocation, including; disassembly, reassembly, alignment and specification testing, can only be done by FEI Company. FEI Company (formerly Philips Electron Optics), the original manufacturer of the microscope, has maintained the instrument since its procurement.

FEI Company's service engineers are the only engineers that receive factory training on how to maintain and repair these instruments, and therefore, are the only ones that have the necessary knowledge to perform this work. Furthermore, the microscope being moved is currently under a maintenance contract with FEI Company, and using a third party, even if another qualified company existed, would infringe on the agreement currently in place.</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit a response. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Kathleen J. Marsden, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 435-0364, Fax (301) 480-3345, Email km66x@nih.gov - Lynn M Furtaw, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-0357, Fax 301-480-3432, Email lynn.furtaw@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) anticipates that Request for Proposals (RFP) No. NHLBI-HB-11-02 will be available on or about October 23, 2009.  The solicitation will be for the Data Coordinating Center for the program entitled Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study  III (REDS-III).  It is anticipated that one award will be made in January 2011 for a period of seven years.  

The objectives of the REDS-III program are to assure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S. affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S. but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. 

NHLBI plans to support one data coordinating center, one central laboratory, up to four domestic hubs, and up to 4 international collaborative programs involving U.S. investigators and investigators at international blood centers.  THIS NOTICE ADDRESSES THE DATA COORDINATING CENTER ONLY.

The REDS-III program will target the following blood banking and transfusion medicine areas: 1) donor targeted strategies; 2) blood banking; 3) transfusion practices in adult patients; and 4) education and training.  The goal of this highly structured, multi-center, donor-recipient epidemiology, laboratory, and clinical outcomes program is to advance public health by conducting critical research to improve transfusion practices and the safety and adequacy of the blood supply in the U.S. and in countries affected by the AIDS epidemic.  The program will include large survey, epidemiological and laboratory investigations. Clinical trials in potential recipients of blood products are NOT within the purview of the REDS-III program.  The research portfolios of the REDS-III Domestic and International programs will be fashioned in response to contemporary scientific questions which need to be addressed to advance blood transfusion safety in the U.S. and in countries where REDS-III international blood centers are located.  It is expected that about one third of the studies conducted in the REDS-III Domestic program will address donor and/or donation safety and availability issues, and other blood banking questions; and that about two thirds of the investigations will address adult transfusion recipient safety concerns.  Most studies performed in the international setting, however, are expected to address blood banking concerns including donor and/or donation safety and availability issues although a small number of studies might address transfusion recipient safety concerns. Comprehensive databases including information on donors and their donations/components (required for the Domestic and International programs), and on adult patients considered for, or receiving a transfusion (required for the Domestic program only) will enable study investigators with the necessary scientific and analytical expertise to address in a timely fashion, important scientific issues in blood banking and transfusion medicine.

The domestic hubs and the international programs shall be supported by a DCC which shall be responsible for overall coordination, communications, data management, and analytical/statistical support. The domestic hubs and the international programs shall also be supported by a central laboratory which shall be responsible for the necessary infectious disease, molecular, genetic, immunological, hematological, and other testing conducted in the U.S., and for serving as the REDS-III biospecimen repository.  

The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) shall compile donation and patient data from the domestic centers (i.e., hubs) in 1) a centralized cumulative donor/donation/component database; 2) a centralized cumulative patient database; and 3) a centralized cumulative linked donor-recipient database that shall link all information on donors and their donations/components to information on the patients who received these components. The hub Centralized Data Collection Center (CCC) shall provide to the DCC the links that shall allow for the data from the donors, their donations and components to be linked with data on the recipients who received them.  It will be desirable that at least 20,000 RBC transfusion exposures occur per year at each hubs participating hospitals/outpatient clinics.  It would also be desirable, although not required, that the consortium of hospitals participating in the hub admitted the following minimum number of cross-matched adult patients each year at the following hospital services: 1) intensive care units: 1,000; 2) cardiac surgery, 1,000;  3) orthopedic surgery,  500; 4) oncology/cancer center, 1,000; and  5) trauma service, 1,000.  Each hubs blood center must collect at least 75,000 allogeneic blood donations per year.  Analysis of all data compiled in the databases shall be conducted by the DCC.  Additionally, the DCC shall be responsible for coordination, data management, and analytical/statistical support of an estimated five large epidemiological and/or survey studies and about ten laboratory studies [which may or may not be component(s) of the large epidemiological studies] during the course of the domestic program. 

The DCC shall compile donor and donation data from each international site in a centralized cumulative donor/donation database and shall be responsible for providing all statistical/analytical support for the analysis of these data. The blood centers participating in each international program must collect a total of at least 250,000 blood donations annually from at least three collaborating foreign collection sites located in a low or middle income country affected by the AIDS epidemic. Each foreign blood collection site must collect a minimum of 25,000 donations annually. Analysis of all data compiled in the database shall be conducted by the DCC. Additionally, the DCC shall be responsible for coordination, data management, and analytical/statistical support of an estimated three large epidemiological and/or survey studies and about three laboratory studies [which may or may not be component(s) of the large epidemiological studies] conducted at each of the REDS-III international collaborative programs. 

The DCC shall perform the following study requirements: 1) coordinate REDS-III activities and participate as a member of the Oversight and Steering Committees to develop and implement a coordinated plan to achieve program objectives; 2) develop and maintain operating procedures for the REDS-III program; 3) develop and maintain a public and private REDS-III website; 4) develop and finalize the protocols and associated Manuals of Operations for the cumulative centralized databases; 5) coordinate and participate in the development and finalization of REDS-III study protocols and develop corresponding Manuals of Operations;  6) provide all necessary data management and tracking systems; 7) track all REDS-III biospecimens  and their associated data, and identify biospecimens for retrieval; 8) provide training sessions and conduct site visits, as appropriate; 9) provide biostatistical support during protocol development and analyze database and study data collected during REDS-III; 10) assist the Oversight Committee and Steering Committees in preparation of scientific reports for publication and presentation; 11) help coordinate and convene the REDS-III Observational Study Monitoring Board (OSMB),  provide administrative and logistic support for OSMB meetings/calls, prepare and present data reports to the OSMB, and prepare minutes of the sessions; 12) coordinate and convene the REDS-III External Review Panel,  assist the NHLBI COTR(s) with the selection and invitation of the External Review Panel, provide administrative and logistic support for the External Review Panel meetings, prepare minutes from External Panel  sessions and coordinate and pay for External Review Panel members travel and honorarium; 13) prepare quarterly and annual technical reports;  14) interact with the COTR(s) on programmatic research activity issues; 15) At close-out of the study, or earlier as directed by the COTR(s), create public use data sets for each data collection activity with documentation; and 16) ensure an orderly transition of REDS-III resources to a successor contractor at contract expiration. 

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) and the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  The RFP will be available on the FedBizOpps web page at www.fedbizopps.gov.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments.  It is also the offerors' responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps web page for the release of any amendments to the RFP.  The RFP will contain all the information and details to allow potential offerors to prepare and submit a contract proposal.  This acquisition has been designated as a full and open competition under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712 and the size standard is 500 employees.  Subcontracting opportunities are anticipated during the course of this contract.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the NHLBI.

<DESC>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a requirement for a contract to provide high quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses on published reports on diagnostic tests, medical and surgical treatment interventions in the neonatal-perinatal medicine, and provide the individual reports in a specified electronic format to the NICHD for posting on its public website. The electronic manuscript with summary evidence is made available on the NICHD website to <br />help pediatricians across USA to access it freely, guiding their practice. Individual researchers who conduct clinical trials to evaluate the benefits of new drugs, diagnostic tests, specific therapies, or surgical interventions, etc., publish their results in peer-reviewed journals (e.g, in the New England Journal of Medicine, or JAMA, etc). When many research groups conduct research on specific interventions, their findings may or may not be the same as those of previously published research. This can lead to difficulties for choosing appropriate therapy for the practitioner. As an example: if 4 studies testing the effect of an antibiotic for sore throat conclude that the drug was not effective, 2 others concluding that was extremely effect, and 5 others studies find drug can actually worsened the disease, the clinicians cannot determine whether to use the drug or not. Thus, such contradictory outcomes need to be resolved to clarify the direction of the "collective evidence" for doctors to offer most appropriate therapy to their patients.
<p>The anticipated contract type will be a cost reimbursement a base year of one year with four option years. <br />The RFP is anticipated to be posted on or about March 23, 2011 on FedBizOpps (FBO) website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>REQUIREMENT:<br />The United States Government ("Government") is seeking expressions of interest from potential sources for office space in downtown Greenwood, Indiana. The US Government's existing lease in Greenwood, Indiana is expiring and the Government is considering if it would be economically advantageous for the Government to relocate. The Government is interested in leasing approximately 9,715 rentable square feet of Class A office space in the City of Greenwood, Indiana, for use by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The area of consideration/delineated area is as noted above. The space must yield a minimum of 9,054 ANSI/BOMA (formerly "Usable") square feet of contiguous space. The anticipated term is 10 years, 5 years firm as a fully serviced lease. In addition to the rental costs, the Government will also factor in costs of moving to a new location including, but not limited to, physical move, tenant improvements, above-standard/specialized alterations/equipment, furniture relocation, telecommunications, and other related costs. Note that these same costs may not be factored in when evaluating whether it is most advantageous to the Government to remain in the current lease location. The building must be located in a prime commercial office district with attractive, prestigious, professional surroundings and a prevalence of contemporary design and/or tasteful rehabilitation in current use. Streets and public sidewalks must be well maintained. The location should provide regularly scheduled public transportation and employee parking within convenient walking distance of the offered building sufficient to cover commuting needs of employees. Buildings offered for consideration must be of sound and substantial construction of the type generally recognized as contemporary with the ability to demonstrate meeting all current Federal/GSA/PBS, State, and local codes and regulations including but not limited to fire and life safety, accessibility, OSHA, and seismic protection.<br />SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS<br />Expressions of interest from the advertisement must include all the elements required in the FedBizOpps ad or the Lease Contracting Officer/Broker must get all the information from those asking to be included on the market survey prior to determining the locations to visit on the pre-market survey. The normal list follows and can be copied and pasted into the advertisement format:<br />1. Building name/address.<br />2.

The application of a scale of words will be used in conjunction with narrative, to denote the degree to which the proposal has met the standard for criteria evaluation.  For purposes of this solicitation, ratings will consist of words (adjectival method) used in conjunction with narratives.  Ratings will be applied at the criterion and sub-criterion level.  If at any level of indentation an Offer's submittal is evaluated as not meeting a minimum requirements stated for a criteria (that is, below the level of Satisfactory), the rating may be included in the rating and narrative assessment at that level and each higher level of indentation.  Therefore, a Marginal or Unacceptable rating at any level may be carried to the criterion level.  The following ratings will be used to evaluate the submitted information.<br><br>(i) Outstanding - Information submitted demonstrates offeror's potential to significantly exceed performance or capability standards.  The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated.  Have exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government.  The offeror's qualifications exceed the fullest expectations of the Government.  The offeror has convincingly demonstrated that the announcement criteria requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when implemented, should result in outstanding, effective, efficient, and economical performance under an awarded contract.  Significantly exceeds most or all announcement criteria requirements.  There is a very high probability of success.<br><br>(ii) Above Average - Information submitted demonstrates offeror's potential to exceed performance or capability standards.  Have one or more strengths that will benefit the Government.  The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality.  The offeror's qualifications meet and slightly exceed requirements.  The submittal contains excellent features that will likely produce results very beneficial to the Government.  The information submitted fully meets all announcement criteria requirements and significantly exceeds many of the announcement criteria requirements.  Disadvantages are minimal.  There is a high probability of success.<br><br>(iii) Satisfactory (Neutral) - Information submitted demonstrate offeror's potential to meet performance or capability standards.  The information represents an acceptable solution.  Either meets all announcement criteria requirements for the criterion (or sub-criterion) or contains weaknesses in some areas that are offset by strengths in other areas.  A rating of Satisfactory indicates that, in terms of the specific criterion (or sub-criterion), the offeror has a good probability of success, as there is sufficient confidence that a fully compliant level of performance will be achieved.  The submittal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the scope and depth of the announcement criteria requirements.  No significant advantages or disadvantages, the submittal is neutral.  There is a good probability of success.<br><br>(iv) Marginal - The submittal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific criterion (or sub-criterion) of the announcement.  The offeror's interpretation of the Government's requirements is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect and therefore could be considered deficient.  The submittal does not meet some of the minimum announcement criteria requirements.  The assignment of a rating within the bounds of Marginal indicates that a mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall submittal rating.  The offeror's qualifications, plans or approach will likely result in questionable quality of performance, which represents a moderate level of risk to the Government.  There is a low probability of success although the submittal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least acceptable.  There are significant disadvantages.<br><br>(v) Unsatisfactory - The submittal fails to meet performance or capability standards.  Unacceptable.  Announcement criteria requirements can only be met through a major revision and/or changes to the submittal.  There is no reasonable expectation that acceptable performance would be achieved.  The submittal contains many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; fails to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Government's requirements; and/or fails to meet most or all of the minimum announcement criteria requirements. There are very significant disadvantages.<br><br>5.

The application of a scale of words will be used in conjunction with narrative, to denote the degree to which the proposal has met the standard for a criteria evaluation factor. For purposes of this solicitation, ratings will consist of words (adjectival method) used in conjunction with narratives. Ratings will be applied at the criterion and sub-criterion level. If at any level of indentation an Offers submittal is evaluated as not meeting a minimum requirements stated for the criteria (that is, below the level of Satisfactory),the rating may be included in the rating and narrative assessment at that level and each higher level of indentation. Therefore, a Marginal or Unacceptable rating at any level may be carried to the criterion level. The following ratings will be used to evaluate the submitted information.<br><br>(i) Outstanding - Information submitted demonstrates offeror's potential to significantly exceed performance or capability standards. The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated. Have exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government. The offeror's qualifications exceed the fullest expectations of the Government. The offeror has convincingly demonstrated that the announcement criteria requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when implemented, should result in outstanding, effective, efficient, and economical performance under an awarded contract. Significantly exceeds most or all announcement criteria requirements. There is a very high probability of success.<br><br>(ii) Above Average - Information submitted demonstrates offeror's potential to exceed performance or capability standards. Have one or more strengths that will benefit the Government. The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality. The offeror's qualifications meet and slightly exceed requirements. The submittal contains excellent features that will likely produce results very beneficial to the Government. The information submitted fully meets all announcement criteria requirements and significantly exceeds many of the announcement criteria requirements. Disadvantages are minimal. There is a high probability of success.<br><br>(iii) Satisfactory (Neutral) - Information submitted demonstrate offeror's potential to meet performance or capability standards. The information represents an acceptable solution. Either meets all announcement criteria requirements for the criterion (or sub-criterion) or contains weaknesses in some areas that are offset by strengths in other areas. A rating of Satisfactory indicates that, in terms of the specific criterion (or sub-criterion), the offeror has a good probability of success, as there is sufficient confidence that a fully compliant level of performance will be achieved. The submittal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the scope and depth of the announcement criteria requirements. No significant advantages or disadvantages, the submittal is neutral. There is a good probability of success.<br><br>(iv) Marginal - The submittal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific criterion (or sub-criterion) of the announcement. The offeror's interpretation of the Governments requirements is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect and therefore could be considered deficient. The submittal does not meet some of the minimum announcement requirements. The assignment of a rating within the bounds of Marginal indicates that a mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall project. The offeror's qualifications, plans or approach will likely result in questionable quality of performance, which represents a moderate level of risk to the Government. There is a low probability of success although the submittal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least acceptable. There are significant disadvantages.<br><br>(v) Unsatisfactory - The submittal fails to meet performance or capability standards. Announcement criteria requirements can only be met through a major revision and/or changes to the submittal. There is no reasonable expectation that acceptable performance would be achieved. The submittal contains many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; fails to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Governments requirements; and/or fails to meet most or all of the minimum announcement criteria requirements. There are very significant disadvantages.<br><br>5.

<DESC>***Revision to original RFI 12/16/10 to change NAICS code***Synopsis: <BR>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC/ARSTRAT) seeks information regarding capability, maturity, cost and technical information for the acquisition of microsatellites (Microsats) and related support services. Although no formal solicitation exists at this time, SMDC/ARSTRAT is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to gain awareness and capabilities of available vendors that can meet SMDC/ARSTRAT's microsatellite and support services requirements for future acquisition.<BR><BR>The request for information encompasses the following requirements: <BR><BR>Microsatellite: SMDC/ARSTRAT seeks to attain information regarding development of microsatellites that possess flexibility in its design to serve as "motherships" or "deployer" satellites to host and/or deploy assigned payloads from SMDC/ARSTRAT and its customers. SMDC/ARSTRAT requires microsatellites with a minimum Technology Readiness Level of 8 to 9 for all spaceflight hardware with a design capable to achieve class C-D.

<CONTACT>Benjamin R Walker, Contracting Officer, Phone 940-676-4406, Fax 940-676-2178, Email benjamin.walker@sheppard.af.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirement</span></strong>: Sheppard Air Force Base Texas is requesting contractor assistance in the creation of a Indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for all flooring projects at Sheppard AFB, Texas. This contract will be known as the <strong><em>Sheppard Infrastructure Flooring Enhancement</em></strong> (SIFE) contract. This IDIQ will establish a single contract awardee or potentially multiple contractors who will be awarded a contract. Only contractors who who receive a SIFE contract award will receive request for quotes for any subsequent carpeting, tile, and or other flooring projects at Sheppard AFB, Texas. Contractors who are not a part of the SIFE IDIQ contract will not receive requests for proposals for subsequent task orders after the SIFE contract is awarded. The anticipated period of performance for this contract is 5 years (base year plus 4 option years).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose</span></strong>: The purpose of this request for information is to solicit industry input to facilitate finalizing the acquisition strategy for the SIFE contract. One key issue being discussed is whether to award one SIFE contract with a price list that will be used for the duration of the contract (5 years) or multiple contracts where each individual project (task order) is competed among the SIFE contract awardees.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Job Types:</span></strong> Typical flooring projects with a preset carpet type would be established. The prospective contractor(s) must be able to perform asbestos abatement, tile flooring, baseboards, carpet installations, and incidental work necessary to completing projects (e.g., moving furniture).</p>
<p>Please answer the following questions to the best of your ability, and return your response to Attention Ben Walker, Email: Benjamin.Walker@Sheppard.AF.Mil . The following questions are being asked to shape the acquisition strategy for the SIFE contract.</p>
<p>1. Provide your&nbsp;input on whether the SIFE IDIQ contract should have one or multiple contractors (up to 5)?</p>
<p>2. Provide input on a multiyear contract with a price list for each year versus a multiyear contract without a price list where project (task order) prices are established through competition among the SIFE contract awardees before each individual task orders are awarded?</p>
<p>3. On average, how long does it take your company to begin a project after you receive the contract?</p>
<p>4. Furniture moving is a part of most every flooring contract. Do you typically provide moves with your proposal, or do the carpet installers move the furniture?</p>
<p>5. Do you have any other input that you believe would be helpful in finalizing our SIFE contract acquisition strategy?</p>

<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.</p>
<p>The 22d Contracting Squadron (22 CONS) of the 22d Air Refueling Wing is conducting market research to determine the availability, interest and capability of potential small business sources qualified and able to compete for a contract to perform the custodial services requirements at McConnell AFB, Kansas. The information in this notice is based on the best and most current information available to date. This information is subject to change and is not binding to the Government. Updated information will be provided in future announcements and posted electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities homepage at www.fbo.gov. The Government shall not reimburse the costs of preparing responses to this request for information/sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The 22d Contracting Squadron (AMC), McConnell Air Force Base (AFB), Kansas, intends to issue a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) in the May/June 2011 timeframe for the acquisition of custodial services to be performed at McConnell AFB KS. The estimated contract period including all options is 1 October 2011 through 30 September 2016. The successful contractor shall provide all personnel, management, tools, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation and all other items necessary (excluding Government Furnished Property) necessary to ensure that custodial services are performed at McConnell AFB in a manner that will maintain a satisfactory facility condition and present a clean, neat and professional appearance. All work performed by the contractor shall be performed in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, Air Force standards, instructions, and commercial practices as set forth in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) for said services. The NAICS code for this requirement is 561720, Janitorial Services.

<p>22 CONS is interested in quantifying and pre-qualifying the likelihood of setting aside competition for Custodial services for McConnell AFB to a small business. Depending upon the response to this notice and other market research, 22 CONS may limit the competition to a specific category of small business at the exclusion of all other potential business concerns. This announcement serves as a first step for 22 CONS to determine the viability of setting aside the procurement of Custodial services for competition solely within or among certain small businesses in selected categories. This is a Sources Sought Announcement only; no solicitation exists or is available at this time. Requests for a solicitation shall not receive a response.</p>
<p>This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.

<a href="mailto:allison.griffin@us.army.mil">RDECOM Natick Contracting Center ICP (RDECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, Natick, MA,is conducting a market survey to identify sources with the capability to measure wind direction and magnitude at various altitudes above a remote stationary position and interface with the Army's Joint Precision Aerial Delivery System, 2,000 Pound (JPADS 2K).  <BR><BR>The wind sensing system must be able to interface with a computer based ground station via 802.11b (T) and any other standard communications protocol (O).  The system must be capable of measuring wind direction and magnitude directly above a potential drop zone (Threshold) and providing wind profiles at a user specified horizon angle (Objective).  Measurements must be taken at range gates of 0ft, 100ft, 500ft and 1000ft (T) with additional gates at increments of 500ft (O).  The sensing system must have a stand-alone, rechargeable power supply (T) and must be deployable, sustainable and maintainable in all weather and altitude conditions without degradation of measurement precision (T).  Data from the sensor must be formatted in the same manner as the JPADS Mission Planner (JPADS-MP) Drop Sonde messages as detailed in the JPADS-MP Interface Control Document, which will be made available upon request.<BR><BR>The current wind sensing capabilities employed operationally include use of hand-held anemometers and releasing either ground based balloons or aircraft deployed drop sondes. <BR>While the methodologies described above provide some knowledge of the wind profile, shortcomings in precision, range and applicability degrade the utility of the information.  While hand-held anemometers provide fairly accurate and near real-time data, the range of available data will not extend far beyond the height of the user.  Balloon and drop sonde data provide extended sensing ranges but may not be temporally and/or spatially accurate.  This shift in time or space is often dictated by the current Concept of Operations (CONOPs) and the availability of resources.  These are also one-time use solutions that incur cost and environmental waste.<BR><BR>While these limitations have not prevented the use of cargo airdrop by the Army, lack of accurate, real-time knowledge of the wind profile represents the single largest source of error that has hindered significant accuracy improvements in current and future autonomously guided, controllable cargo airdrop systems.  Wind shears and inaccuracies in the forecast also represent a non-trivial health risk to personnel airdrop, especially when missions are carried out at night or in non-ideal environmental conditions.<BR><BR>The envisioned sensor shall provide a level of precision in the wind direction of +/- 15  (T) or less (O).  The precision of measured wind magnitudes shall be 2 knots (T) or less (O).  Measurements shall be provided at a rate of 1 Hz (T) and transmitted to a ground station via wireless or wired platform.<BR><BR>The government is looking for the offerors to provide an estimate of the non-recurring engineering and manufacturing costs and delivery schedule estimate of the proposed system in quantities of 1, 5 and 10 to include a delivery schedule for each quantity. Achievement of the cost and schedule goals can be attained by development of innovative new technologies, modification of existing equipment or the coupling of Consumer Off-The-Shelf items capable of meeting the aforementioned performance requirements. Offerors need to be cognizant of all laws and regulations associated with individual proposed technologies.<BR><BR>Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside of the U.S. government.

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought
Requirement:
The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Stamford, Texas that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 250 to 1250 contiguous rentable square feet of medical office and related medical space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 250 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for seven (7) years.  After the 3rd anniversary of the commencement of the term of the Lease, the Government, at its sole discretion may notify the Lessor of the early termination of the Lease by giving at least 90 days written advance notice to the Lessor.  The space must be available for occupancy by 6/30/2011. The delineated area is within the city limits of Stamford, Texas.
Other applicable requirements include:
"	Proximity to Hwy 277 and HWY 6
"	Six (6) VA dedicated parking spaces
"	Full Service Lease Requirement (not limited to all utilities, janitorial service(s), landscaping, pest control, air conditioning, plumbing, elevators, miscellaneous).
The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.
Please send expressions of interest to:

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">With the advent of IP based physical security infrastructure, a web-based access control system that will provide for central management of several GSA-networked facilities (similar to the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) delivery model), provides an operationally and financially feasible security infrastructure solution. GSA PBS has decided to utilize a "private" cloud computing infrastructure as the platform for this model to provide physical access control solutions for building perimeter access. This approach includes establishing a perimeter physical access control solution for multi-tenant buildings to be used as one common infrastructure that is centrally hosted but managed with delegated administration and shared across all buildings. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Recognizing that several technical and operational standards regarding this type of solution have yet to be published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), GSA is seeking a strategy that guarantees future compliance with all applicable technical and procedural standards.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  <BR><BR>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  The Government is in need of information on potential sources that could provide services for a potential requirement of a Surveillance and Target Acquisition System.  The purpose of this RFI is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities, and qualifications of vendors who can successfully support this requirement as a prime contractor or system integrator.  Responses must clearly demonstrate Technical and Logistics qualifications, capability and expertise to serve as a prime contractor or system integrator. <BR><BR>The type of solicitation that will be issued will depend upon the responses to this sources sought notice and other information available to the Government.  Responses to this notice will be used as part of the information gathered as market research that will be used to develop the acquisition strategy to satisfy this potential requirement.<BR><BR>The Government has not formalized an acquisition strategy, there is no solicitation and there is no other information available at this time.  Only timely responses to this RFI will be accepted.  Questions regarding the scope of work or acquisition strategy will not be accepted or answered at this time.  In order to protect the procurement integrity of a potential future procurement that may arise from this announcement, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made.  <BR>      <BR>The USASMDC is conducting a Market Survey to identify sources that can provide commercial surveillance and target acquisition system ("the system") and serve as a prime contractor or system integrator for these systems.  The system shall be capable of detecting hostile troop and/or equipment movement at distances of up to 40+ kilometers, recognizing personnel at distances in excess of 28 kilometers and identifying personnel in excess of 17 kilometers.  The system is intended to minimize the vulnerability of U.S. and coalition forces to armed attack and enable timely and appropriate response options such as, direct air attack, indirect fire, and ground patrol/attack against improvised explosive devices (IEDs), vehicle-born improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs), rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), mortar, and small arms attacks.  The system shall operate at the unclassified level and shall be capable of providing data to classified systems without directly connecting to the classified network.  <BR><BR>Current Rapid Aerostat Initial Deployment (RAID) and Base Expeditionary Targeting and Surveillance System-Combined (BETSS-C) tower systems elevate at least 80 feet Both RAID and BETSS-C tower systems provide a platform to mount an electro optical/infrared (EO/IR) day/night sensor camera. The  tower system requires trailer mounted outriggers with guy cables that attach to Jersey Barriers or equivalent type mounting points. Some tower systems use self-guying cables that mount to the trailer mounted outriggers for ease of installation/de-installation. Both tower systems use fiber optic cabling connected to a command control standard ground station that can either be set up in a tactical operations center or be established for use in the CONEX shelter.  All proposed system components shall be transportable via military air (fixed wing, such as C-5/C-17 or rotary wing-sling load operations) and ground vehicles. In addition, the system shall meet the Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM) and environmental requirements listed in this request for information.  The system shall include:<BR><BR>* A trailer, a trailer-mounted elevated platform system and a standard military shelter/storage/shipping container<BR>* A sensor suite that is capable of providing 360 degree, day/night visible and thermal imaging<BR>* A system control  and display unit<BR><BR>Government Furnished Equipment<BR>* Standard Ground Station (SGS) to include Terre Sight  Software by Sarnoff Corporation, to be used to ultimately replace the system control and display unit provided by the Responder.  <BR>* Tactical Quiet Generators (TQGs), 5KW<BR><BR>Integration of System Components<BR><BR>The prime contractor or SI shall be capable of integrating components, both contractor furnished and government furnished, into a fully operational system by developing the required mechanical, electrical, power, data, physical, safety, and human interfaces as given in the various interface control documents and drawings.  <BR><BR>Responders shall discuss their ability to conduct operations for final system integration and functional verification test in Huntsville, Alabama, at no additional cost to the government.  If a solicitation is issued and a contract awarded, the system shall undergo a functional verification test prior to delivery to the Government on Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. <BR>      <BR>Sensor Suite<BR>	<BR>The system shall use an electro/optical infrared (EO/IR) sensor. Visible and infrared capabilities are required for day and night time use.  Visible sensor shall include full color spectrum and spotter scope capability for zooming in on distant targets of interest and obtaining maximum discriminatory information on those targets.  Visible and infrared sensors shall be bore sighted together such that switching from one sensor to the other shall result in looking at the same location. A laser range finder (or equivalent geo location device) shall also be bore sighted to the visible and infrared sensor look angles for accurate computation of the location of the object being viewed.  Sensor housing shall be actively stabilized to insure that distant targets, regardless of their relative motion with respect to the sensor, can be viewed for extended periods of time without resulting in excessive strain on the operator viewing the image.  Visible and infrared sensors shall have multiple fields of view to allow for wide angle panning of the area followed by an instantaneous switching to a narrow or super narrow field of regard for rapidly assessing distant targets of interest.  Sensor shall also have a laser illuminator and auto tracking capability.  The laser illuminator shall provide a beam of light visible only through night vision goggles.  That beam of light shall originate at the sensor and be bore sighted such that it shall terminate at the target of interest as soon as it is activated (i.e. no searching for the target shall be required).<BR> <BR>The control and display functions of this sensor suite (i.e. visible sensor, IR sensor, spotter scope and laser illuminator) shall be documented in an interface control document.  This interface control document shall be used to assess the level of software modifications that shall be required to interface these control and display functions with their existing map overlay software.  Hardware mounting documentation shall also be provided for a determination of the level of effort that shall be required to mount the selected sensor to existing platforms such as towers and masts.  <BR><BR>The sensor system shall be able to self locate and orient to 6 digit map coordinates and provide this data to the command and control station operating system.<BR><BR>Sensor Interface<BR><BR>Responders shall be capable of integrating both contractor provided control and display functions and at government direction, a government furnished standard ground station (SGS). The GFE SGS functions of this sensor suite (i.e. visible sensor, IR sensor, spotter scope, laser illuminator, etc.) will be documented in an interface control document provided by the government.  This interface control document shall be used by the contractor to describe modifications required to their COTS system to integrate the GFE SGS as the command and control unit.   Hardware mounting documentation shall also be provided for a determination of the level of effort required to mount the selected sensor suite to existing platforms such as towers and masts.  <BR><BR>Elevated Platform<BR><BR>The elevated platform shall: <BR><BR>Be transportable, trailer mounted, self-supporting and extendable. If the proposed system requires guy wire operations, the elevated platform shall support guying into itself. The guy cables shall latch onto points upon the trailer/outriggers of the platform and support tensioning of the cables commensurate with safe tower operations. <BR><BR>Include all hardware and controls to extend tower system to required heights. Operational elevated platform heights shall be 80 feet above ground level and if practicable, operational heights shall be achieved above 100 feet above ground level. <BR><BR>Have a payload capability which shall support a threshold, including the sensor suite and related electronics, of 625 pounds with an objective of 850 pounds. The attached elevated platform payload "sail area" for wind loading is 20 square feet threshold and 30 square feet objective.<BR><BR>Responders shall be capable of providing a shelter/storage/shipping container that can be used as an operator station when operating in remote areas.  The standard military container shall be sized to accommodate 2 operators, a 6 foot folding table, 2 folding chairs and an air conditioner/heating unit sized for use in the area of operation. The shelter shall observe human factors required for healthy/breathable occupation of shelter. The unit shall be able to be sufficiently sealed so that light shall not filter out of the container when it is used at night. All of the ground station hardware shall be stowed in this container during transport or relocation.  The container shall provide electrical power ground lugs (grounding points) as needed.<BR>   <BR>Ground Station <BR><BR>Responders shall be able to provide a system control and display unit that shall provide interconnectivity between the Elevated Platform, Ground Station and Sensor Suite. <BR> <BR>Responder shall be capable of replacing, at Government direction, their own control and display unit with a government furnished SGS and integrate it in accordance with government-furnished interface control documentation. <BR><BR>Reliability, Maintainability, Availability (RAM)<BR><BR>The trailer and elevated platform, that is the system less the sensor, SGS and TQG, shall have a threshold mean time between failure (MTBF) of 5,000 hours under harsh environments and 24/7 usage.

<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7930-00-NIB-0622<br />Name: Detergent, Laundry, No Optical Brighteners, 3/4 Ounce Packets, Box of 50 packets<br />Description: Laundry detergent without optical brighteners. A very effective laundry detergent for removing soil and odors that is designed to reduce troop visibility in military applications. Box contains 50, 3/4 ounce packets.</p>
<p>NSN: 7930-00-NIB-0624<br />Name: Detergent, Laundry, High Efficiency, 3/4 Ounce Packets, Box of 100 packets<br />Description: High efficiency laundry detergent in pre-measured water-soluble packets. An effective but moderately priced laundry detergent with deep cleaning action. Low foaming, odor counteracting formula. Box contains 100, 3/4-ounce packets.</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>NSN: 7930-00-NIB-0622<br />Similar Items: None Reported</p>
<p>NSN: 7930-00-NIB-0624<br />Similar Items: None Reported</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 23, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

Dr. Husain will, over a period of approximately nine months, provide highly specialized assistance required to validate the One Shot Phase 2E product pricing through a detailed analysis of the One Shot 2E Bill-of-Materials and the production (assembly and testing) labor in an effort to validate proposed costs and, as appropriate, develop recommendations for potential cost reductions (i.e., potential technology/parts changes, supplier/pricing changes, etc.).  Dr. Husain was formerly the founder and Chairman of OMM Inc. which took optical concepts from R&amp;D to manufactured optical systems and subsystems.  Additionally, Dr. Husain has over 35 years of experience in R&amp;D manufacturing of optical components and systems.  Dr. Husain is exceptionally qualified to conduct the necessary One Shot product pricing analysis due to his past experience evaluating advanced optical technologies and manufacturing techniques that have direct relevance to the One Shot program.  This announcement constitutes the only synopsis for this requirement, is not a not a request for proposals, or an RFP of any kind, and is issued for notification purposes only.

Listed below are the sole source FSCs which we propose to award a 90 day contract: 1005, 1010, 2040, 2510, 2530, 2540, 2590, 2815, 3040, 3110, 3120, 3830, 3990, 4010, 4130, 4210, 4210, 4320, 4710, 4720, 4730, 5305, 5306, 5307, 5310, 5320, 5325, 5330, 5340, 5365, 5930, 5945, 5970, 5975, 5985, 6150, 7690, 9320, 9340, 9515 and 9905. The contract is for a period of 90 days pending the award of the successor solicitation SPM7LX08R0179.  The current contract will expire on December 16, 2009 and this contract will incorporate all technical products and service requirements and contract terms and conditions contained within Contract SPM75005D7426 by a contract modification action. The sole source award by contract modification is being issued through other than full and open competition procedures (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B)) and will expire on March 16, 2010.

There is currently a large Army reset program in the works and any delay in the procurement process will impact readiness of the Up Armored HMMWV fleet.  These vehicles are those that are needed in support of SWA.  The current contract with BAE is helping us maintain a readiness rate of 92%.  With the contract currently in place with BAE, they can support these urgent requirements and can supply these items with a delivery of 5-10 days (depending on Priority code) directly to the customer. It is in the Governments best interest to make this sole source award to BAE Survivability Systems.

If you should have any questions or concerns about this notice, or if you have an interest in this procurement, please contact Margaret Mickey at 614-692-8868 or email at margaret.mickey@dla.mil.

Agency Contact Information:Acquisition Services DirectorateNational Business CenterDepartment of the Interior381 Elden Street, Suite 4000Herndon, VA 20170
Place of Performance:  Washington, DC
The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Global Insight. This non-competitive action is being issued by the Acquisition Services Directorate under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA), Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS).  
Description of Requirement:  
This is a subscription to Global Insight Global Macroeconomic Analysis Service and for Global Insight to perform GSM102 price review activities. Global Insight is the world's largest macroeconomic analysis and forecasting firm.  Its products available on the web, and not available from other sources, include the Advanced Country Analysis and Forecast Service, China Regional Service, Global Consumer Markets Service, and Comprehensive U.S. Economic Service.  These resources will be available to not only FAS/W staff, but also to FAS/F, ERS, the World Board, and OCE. This information is used by all employees to analyze county, market, and commodity production, trade and price data. FAS still operates the GSM 102 program which requires statutorily price reviews to be done by Office of Global Analysis (OGA).  Given the other analytical demands, OGA does not have the resources to build an in-house price review capability.   Global Insight has the expertise and resources to provide this service. 
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Global Insight currently provides these types of subscriptions.  No other organization is known to provide these type of subscriptions.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities regarding this requirement by submitting a capabilities statement by the date specified herein.  
The period of performance for this effort will be one year.  The Government will consider all capabilities statements received by 12pm EST, Wednesday, March 23, 2011.  Please be advised that it is the offeror's responsibility to assure the Government receives your submission on or before the specified due date.  Submissions shall be sent electronically to Michael McGuire, Contracting Officer at mike.mcguire@aqd.nbc.gov.
This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition. The Government reserves the right to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) as a result of this announcement.  Please be advised that this announcement may constitute the only notice that will be posted for this acquisition, based on the review of any responses to this notice.

<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>Sharron Doherty
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD), ENERGY STAR Residential Branch (ESRB) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to the Systems Building Research Alliance (SBRA) to revise the guidelines used by manufacturing plants, builders, installers and home energy raters to verify that factory-built homes qualify for the ENERGY STAR label.
SBRA?s management and staff have detailed knowledge of the ENERGY STAR program and its technical guidelines for building and installing factory built homes, having applied to and been approved by ENERGY STAR as a national quality assurance provider for ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured and modular homes.  SBRA also helped develop in-plant manufacturing, on-site construction/installation, and quality control procedures that laid the groundwork for what became the guidelines used by all plants to construct ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured and modular homes.  Thus SBRA has intimate knowledge of both the technical guidelines and quality control processes that plants, builders, installers, and quality control personnel need to adhere to in order to consistently design and build ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured and modular homes.  SBRA is also the research arm of the manufactured housing industry.  In this role, SBRA has detailed knowledge of how the manufactured and modular h ousing industries work.  SBRA also works closely with manufactured and modular homebuilders, retailers, installers, industry trade associations, and state/local energy efficiency programs to combine the resources of these organizations to be more effective in jointly building, promoting, and installing ENERGY STAR qualified manufactured and modular homes as an opportunity to reduce energy consumption and improve air quality.  The above makes SBRA uniquely qualified to perform the work to be ordered under this requirement.	NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received within ten (10) calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Sharron K. Doherty via the e-mail link provided.

The application of a scale of words will be used in conjunction with narrative, to denote the degree to which the proposal has met the standard for criteria evaluation.  For purposes of this solicitation, ratings will consist of words (adjectival method) used in conjunction with narratives.  Ratings will be applied at the criterion and sub-criterion level.  If at any level of indentation an Offer's submittal is evaluated as not meeting a minimum requirements stated for a criteria (that is, below the level of Satisfactory), the rating may be included in the rating and narrative assessment at that level and each higher level of indentation.  Therefore, a Marginal or Unacceptable rating at any level may be carried to the criterion level.  The following ratings will be used to evaluate the submitted information.<br><br>(i) Outstanding - Information submitted demonstrates offeror's potential to significantly exceed performance or capability standards.  The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated.  Have exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government.  The offeror's qualifications exceed the fullest expectations of the Government.  The offeror has convincingly demonstrated that the announcement criteria requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when implemented, should result in outstanding, effective, efficient, and economical performance under an awarded contract.  Significantly exceeds most or all announcement criteria requirements.  There is a very high probability of success.<br><br>(ii) Above Average - Information submitted demonstrates offeror's potential to exceed performance or capability standards.  Have one or more strengths that will benefit the Government.  The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality.  The offeror's qualifications meet and slightly exceed requirements.  The submittal contains excellent features that will likely produce results very beneficial to the Government.  The information submitted fully meets all announcement criteria requirements and significantly exceeds many of the announcement criteria requirements.  Disadvantages are minimal.  There is a high probability of success.<br><br>(iii) Satisfactory (Neutral) - Information submitted demonstrate offeror's potential to meet performance or capability standards.  The information represents an acceptable solution.  Either meets all announcement criteria requirements for the criterion (or sub-criterion) or contains weaknesses in some areas that are offset by strengths in other areas.  A rating of Satisfactory indicates that, in terms of the specific criterion (or sub-criterion), the offeror has a good probability of success, as there is sufficient confidence that a fully compliant level of performance will be achieved.  The submittal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the scope and depth of the announcement criteria requirements.  No significant advantages or disadvantages, the submittal is neutral.  There is a good probability of success.<br><br>(iv) Marginal - The submittal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific criterion (or sub-criterion) of the announcement.  The offeror's interpretation of the Government's requirements is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect and therefore could be considered deficient.  The submittal does not meet some of the minimum announcement criteria requirements.  The assignment of a rating within the bounds of Marginal indicates that a mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall submittal rating.  The offeror's qualifications, plans or approach will likely result in questionable quality of performance, which represents a moderate level of risk to the Government.  There is a low probability of success although the submittal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least acceptable.  There are significant disadvantages.<br><br>(v) Unsatisfactory - The submittal fails to meet performance or capability standards.  Unacceptable.  Announcement criteria requirements can only be met through a major revision and/or changes to the submittal.  There is no reasonable expectation that acceptable performance would be achieved.  The submittal contains many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; fails to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Government's requirements; and/or fails to meet most or all of the minimum announcement criteria requirements. There are very significant disadvantages.<br><br>5.

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. <br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).<br />(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.

<p>&nbsp;5352.242-9000 Contractor access to Air Force installations. <br />As prescribed in 5342.490-1, insert a clause substantially the same as the following clause in solicitations and contracts:</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR ACCESS TO AIR FORCE INSTALLATIONS (JUN 2002)</p>
<p>(a) The contractor shall obtain base identification and vehicle passes for all contractor personnel who make frequent visits to or perform work on the Air Force installation(s) cited in the contract. Contractor personnel are required to wear or prominently display installation identification badges or contractor-furnished, contractor identification badges while visiting or performing work on the installation.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall submit a written request on company letterhead to the contracting officer listing the following: contract number, location of work site, start and stop dates, and names of employees and subcontractor employees needing access to the base. The letter will also specify the individual(s) authorized to sign for a request for base identification credentials or vehicle passes. The contracting officer will endorse the request and forward it to the issuing base pass and registration office or security police for processing. When reporting to the registration office, the authorized contractor individual(s) should provide a valid driver's license, current vehicle registration, valid vehicle insurance certificate, and State Police Background Check to obtain a vehicle pass.</p>
<p>(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to the work site.</p>
<p>(d) When work under this contract requires unescorted entry to controlled or restricted areas, the contractor shall comply with AFI 31-101, Volume 1, The Air Force Installation Security Program, and AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management, as applicable.</p>
<p>(e) Upon completion or termination of the contract or expiration of the identification passes, the prime contractor shall ensure that all base identification passes issued to employees and subcontractor employees are returned to the issuing office.</p>
<p>(f) Failure to comply with these requirements may result in withholding of final payment.<br />(End of clause)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.004 -- Legal Effect of Quotations the following information is provided in regards to quotations:<br />A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.<br />When appropriate, the contracting officer may ask the supplier to indicate acceptance of an order by notification to the Government, preferably in writing. In other circumstances, the supplier may indicate acceptance by furnishing the supplies or services ordered or by proceeding with the work to the point where substantial performance has occurred.</p>

(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. The Government will award a fixed price purchase order to the lowest price offeror conforming to the terms and requirements of the solicitation. (x) The offeror must have completed the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) which is the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items. The web site address is https://orca.bpn.gov/.
(xi) The provision at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.
(xii) The provision at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items applies to this acquisition. Additional FAR 52.212-5 clauses cited in the clause applicable to this acquisition are, b (10), b (20), b (21), b (22), b (23), b (24), b (26), b (33), b (34), b (37), and b (42).
(xiii) The provision at the Bureau of Reclamation WBR 1452.211-80, Notice of Intent to Acquire Metric Products and Services (MAR 1993), applies to this acquisition.
(a) Metric Transition Plan. The Department of the Interior on December 6, 1991, issued a Metric Transition Program (Part 758 Department Manual Chapter 1) to establish and describe the program's policies and responsibilities. The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has developed a Metric Transition Plan to implement metrication in Reclamation. This plan describes Reclamation's overall strategy for using the metric system, defines general requirements and procedures for carrying out the transition, and details the tasks with milestones for Reclamation offices to complete.
(b) The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Trade Act). 
(1) Section 5164 of Public Law 100-418, the Trade Act, amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 and designated the metric system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce. 
(2) The Trade Act establishes September 30, 1992 as the implementation date (to the extent economically feasible) for Federal agencies to use the metric system of measurement in its procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. 
(3) The Trade Act permits exceptions to the use of the metric system to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms, such as when foreign competitors are producing competing products in non-metric units.
(4) As a result of the Trade Act, the President issued Executive Order 12770 dated July 25, 1991, to implement the congressional designation of the metric system as the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce.
(c) Bureau of Reclamation Implementation. As a result of the Trade Act, Reclamation will, to the maximum extent practicable, use hard conversion and soft conversion metric systems in designing its construction projects, eventually phasing out use of the soft conversion metric system. Exceptions to this policy will only be made when such use is impractical, produces inefficiencies or market losses, or is not economically feasible.
(d) Expected Results. Reclamation expects its support of the metric system to result in increased use of the metric system by U.S. contractors, thereby increasing their ability to compete in the international marketplace. Increasing use of the metric system by U.S. contractors will eliminate possible restrictions on their bidding in the international marketplace and will eliminate any impact of economic blocks by metric countries restricting the acceptance of non-metric products.
 (xix) The clause at Department of Interior 1452.233-2 Service of Protest (APR 1984), applies to this acquisitionA copy of the protest served on the Contracting Officer shall be simultaneously furnished by the protester to the Department of the Interior Assistant Solicitor for Procurement and Patents, 1849 C Street, NW, Room 6511, Washington, D.C. 20240.
(xx) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) ratings do not apply to this acquisition. 
(xxi) Proposals are required to be received no later than 12:00 pm Mountain Standard Time, Friday April 8, 2011, and must include the following: Company name, address phone numbers, DUNS number, Tax ID number, proposals shall be delivered via email to aphillips@usbr.gov.

Acceptance criteria - Once stabilized at a test depth, the oxygen control system must maintain +/- 0.05 ATM throughout the test period.<br />2. Testing procedures - The CCR oxygen control is evaluated with air as the diluent at 60 fsw (18.3 msw) and 300 fsw (91.4 msw). The number of set points tested will vary with the capability of each system. If high and low set points are provided, both will be tested. For a CCR with multiple set points the low set point, a mid range set point, and the high set point will be evaluated. The oxygen consumption of an exercising diver will be simulated using oxygen consumption rates of 1.0, 1.5 and 2.5 standard liters per minute (slpm) for the respective ventilation rates of 22.5, 40, and 62.5 L/min. The CCR is pressurized to a depth of 60 fsw (18.3 msw) at a rate of 60 feet per minute (18.3 mpm). After the oxygen control is stabilized at 60 fsw (18.3 msw), the CCR is tested for 30 minutes. The CCR is then pressurized to 300 fsw (91.4 msw) at a rate of 60 fpm (18.3 mpm). After oxygen control is stabilized the CCR is tested for 30 minutes then depressurized at 30 fpm (9.1 mpm) to a simulated decompression stop at 30 fsw (9.1 msw). After the oxygen control is stabilized at 30 fsw (9.1 msw), the CCR is tested for 30 minutes, then depressurized to the surface. A minimum of five runs per test condition will be performed. Data of PO2 vs. time will be graphically represented. After the CCR is stabilized at each test depth the mean PO2 (&plusmn; 1 standard deviation) will be reported. The maximum PO2 observed during descent and the minimum PO2 observed during ascent will be noted on the graph. Observations of alarm conditions for low PO2, high PO2, and battery during the pre-dive and dive are to be recorded.</p>

In addition, instruments are also provided for fundamental physics research, neutron interferometry, and neutron optics.</p>
<p>To remain at the forefront of science, the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is continuously developing new and improved instruments for neutron scattering. NIST requires an accurately dimensioned rectangular block made from pure, single-crystal bismuth. This bismuth block shall be cryogenically cooled and shall be located upstream of a new instrument named the Chromatic Analysis Neutron Diffractometer or Reflectometer (CANDOR) and shall be used as a gamma ray filter for CANDOR.</p>
<p>This block of pure bismuth shall be made up of several large crystals and shall be used to filter out unwanted gamma rays from the neutron beam. Single-crystal bismuth is known to be affective in attenuating gamma rays whose high energy can distort the purity of the thermal neutrons. Single crystal and large crystal bismuth has much higher transmission of neutrons between .4nm and .8nm than small crystal (fine grained) polycrystalline due to the minimization of Bragg scattering by reducing the number of individual crystals. Cooling the bismuth has the effect of making the crystals become nearly transparent to thermal neutrons and remain nearly opaque to high energy gamma rays.</p>
<p>All responsible quoters shall provide a quotation for the following line item:</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each, bismuth block (that shall be made up of several large single crystals), which satisfies the material and end product specifications defined herein to achieve the desired performance as a gamma ray filter.</p>

POSITION TITLE: USPSC DLI Program and Training Coordinator <br />5. MARKET VALUE: $71,674-$93,175 per annum (GS-13 equivalent) with 25% Post Differential (currently) <br />6.

<p>A) Background</p>
<p>USAID/CAR has been identified as a mission key training site for the Development Leadership Initiative junior officers joining the Agency. To date, sixteen DLI officers have been assigned to the Mission. Additionally, USAID/CAR is a Regional Training Center for the area, and its five Central Asian countries of responsibility - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The USAID/CAR mission is currently comprised of 234 total staff, with 183 based in the regional office in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The remaining 51 populate our four country offices. We work as a regional mission with a regional approach tailored to each country's specific development challenges, and employees have an opportunity to both apply and gain a variety of knowledge during their tenure through formal and on-the-job training opportunities.</p>
<p>Managing and coordinating the regional training budget, plan and authorizations is a significant task, currently managed by the USAID/CAR training committee. The Mission's training committee is staffed by one USDH and one FSN from the Almaty technical offices, one USDH and one FSN from the support offices, one US staff member and one FSN from the country (non-Almaty) offices, the Regional Deputy Mission Director and is chaired by the S/EXO. One of the Front Office's priorities for the region is to enhance the Mission's understanding and approach to "staff development." All supervisors are required to stretch themselves and their staff as we move towards strengthening our regional teams over the next two years.</p>
<p>In addition, the DLI training and mentoring program of this magnitude requires similar dedicated coordination and support to ensure that training plans are developed in light of regional and other training opportunities; that an effective mentorship program is implemented; that space and logistical requirements are met to provide a supportive work environment for the junior officers; and that all other logistical and training needs are met for the DLI program in Central Asia.

<DESC><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington D.C. 20593-0001<br />Telephone 202-372-3695<br />Fax: 202-475-3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: <br />Commandant (CG-851) 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606 Washington, D. C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<a href="mailto:Bradley.King3@va.gov">CONTRACT SPECIALIST</a>
<DESC>1.0 	BACKGROUND
In addition to its responsibilities for the health and mental health care of those Veterans who utilize Veteran Health Administration (VHA) health care services, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has an interest and responsibility for the health and well-being of all Veterans. These additional responsibilities are addressed through a number of programs and services. These include the Vet Centers program that provides readjustment services for all combat Veterans, whether or not they are enrolled for health care in VHA, as well as a series of outreach programs. A number of activities work by interacting directly with Veterans, including OEF/OEF Veterans in transition, Veterans involved with the justice system, and homeless Veterans. Another group of activities work indirectly by focusing on Veterans' families, and community-based clergy, and the police.

Another potential strategy for ensuring that Veterans' health, mental health, and readjustment needs are met may be to focus on the workplace. Data from the Department of Labor from 2009 indicated that job prospects for Veterans were good. However, reasons for concern come from a 2010 Gallup report indicating that the well-being of Veterans in the workplace was lower than that for other Americans.

To evaluate the need for outreach services to Veterans in the workplace, VA needs information about the current programs for Veterans provided by major employers, the health and performance of Veterans compared to others in the workplace, and the needs of employers, as well as Veterans, for additional resources and services.  
2.0 	APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS

Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employment Situation of Veterans- 2009. News Release. Friday, March 12, 2010. USDL 10-0285

Gallup, Inc. Active Duty Leads U.S. in Wellbeing; Veterans Lag. Press Release. June 30, 2010.

3.0 	SCOPE OF WORK
The Contractor shall provide the resources necessary to accomplish the task as described in this PWS.  The contractor shall develop, implement, and report on a series of projects characterizing the status of Veteran employees in large US businesses, and generate a series of tools and resources based on these findings to support the hiring and retention of Veteran employees in American businesses. All of the personnel, materials and services to complete these activities will be provided by the Contractor.
 
To ensure that the projects are conducted in a manner that addresses VA's needs, the contractor will meet weekly, in person or by telephone with a group of VA staff members designated by VA to  including representative of the Veterans Benefits Administration as well as the Veterans Health Administration, who will review plans and progress. To ensure that the projects are conducted in a manner that addresses the needs of employers and Veterans in the workforce, the Contractor will convene an advisory board to be chaired by a representative of the Department of labor that would include membership from employers, Veterans and representatives of other Federal agencies and offices such as the Department of Labor and the US Office of Personnel Management, and will meet with them on a regular basis to obtain their input on the design and implementation of the projects and the interpretation of findings. 

Project 1: The contractor will report on findings from a survey of at least 100 employers, consisting of small, mid-size, and large (Fortune 500 or 1000) businesses with a geographic distribution representing the East, Midwest, South, and West to characterize: Their current policies, practices, and programs regarding Veterans, National Guard, and Reserves members as employees; Their experience with employees in the National Guard and Reserves who were activated for service in OEF/OIF; Their experience with hiring and retaining Veteran employees who have served in OEF/OIF; Their experience with hiring and retaining Veterans from services in prior eras as employees; and, Their understanding of the mental health and related needs of Veterans, and of the services that would support maintaining productivity in the face of these needs. The report will include a summary and evaluation of findings that includes nominations of "best practice" policies, practices, and programs.

Project 2: The contractor will develop, implement, and report on studies conducted within at least 5 large (Fortune 500 or 1000) employers characterizing: the health and mental health, as well as the use of health and mental health care services of Veterans and their families compared to other employees; and, the positions and productivity of Veteran employees compared with other employees of comparable ages.

Project 3: In consultation with VA staff and the employer-Veteran advisory board, the contractor will review available materials supporting employees, including Veterans, in the workplace to identify materials that would be of specific use to Veterans as well as gaps and needs. The contractor will utilize findings from both the survey and study, as well as evidence from other sources to develop briefing materials, fact sheets, tools, and resources to be used by businesses to support the hiring and retention of Veteran employees. Also in consultation with VA staff and the advisory board, the contractor will develop and implement plans for dissemination of these products both to employers and Veterans.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to add the following regulation and clause for Request For Quotation HSFEMW-11-Q-0013, To provide rental and laundry/maintenance service of uniforms for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center (MWEOC).<br /><br />Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 44, Part 15- Conduct at the Mt Weather Emergency Assistance Center and at the National Emergency Training Center (Issued by reference, for this RFQ).<br /><br />Delivery and General Access to DHS, FEMA, Mt Weather Emergency Operations Center (MWEOC) (issued in full text for this RFQ).<br /><br />DELIVERIES AND GENERAL ACCESS TO DHS, FEMA, MT. WEATHER EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER (MWEOC)<br /><br />a. The DHS, FEMA, MWEOC facility is a controlled access installation and is not open to the general public. Access is limited to those persons who have official business related to the mission and operations of the MWEOC and who are U.S. citizens or have been granted an exception by the Executive Director, or his/her designee. Contractor employees requiring access to the MWEOC facility must receive a favorable police records check. The Government will perform the police records check after receipt of the MOUNT WEATHER ACCESS APPLICATION form. Sponsors of Contractor employees requiring MWEOC access must be U.S. Government personnel. All access requests shall be submitted through the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) or Government Point of Contact (GPOC) to the MWEOC Emergency Services Division. Visitors shall complete Section C of the MOUNT WEATHER ACCESS APPLICATION form and submit it to the COTR or GPOC who will complete Section A and forward it to the MWEOC Emergency Services Division for processing. Contractors are responsible for arranging for facility access for their delivering transportation companies and advising them of MWEOC's controlled access requirements (see paragraph g. below). Access requests must meet criteria as defined in 44CFR Part 15, Subpart A and HSPD-12. Individuals who do not receive a favorable police records check will be refused access to the MWEOC facility.<br />b. MOUNT WEATHER ACCESS APPLICATION forms must be TYPED and shall be submitted through the COTR or GPOC to the MWEOC Emergency Services Division at least seventy-two (72) business hours prior to the need to enter the facility.<br />c. An original or certified proof of citizenship document is required and must be presented for persons born abroad. Acceptable documents are: Certification of Birth abroad issued by the Department of State, Naturalization Certificate, US Citizen ID Card, or US issued Passport.<br />d. Entry to the facility is controlled by a badge system. A badge will be issued to each Contractor or Subcontractor employee requiring access to the MWEOC facility. The employee must present a verification of identity containing the employee's name and photograph (i.e., Vehicle Operator's License, Government issued ID, passport, etc) before a badge will be issued. Persons inside the facility must prominently display badges, above waist level, at all times. Badges are the property of the Government and must be returned to the Main Gate Visitor's Center (Bldg. 911) when the employee departs the facility. Lost or stolen badges shall be promptly reported to the MWEOC Emergency Services Division by completing a lost badge report which can be obtained at the Main Gate Visitor's Center (Bldg. 911).<br />e. Contractor employees requiring access for the duration of the contract must submit a MOUNT WEATHER ACCESS APPLICATION form for each employee. The Contractor shall immediately notify the COTR or GPOC when an employee no longer requires access to MWEOC.<br />f. The MWEOC Executive Administrator, may, for good cause shown, revoke facility access to an individual Contractor or Subcontractor employee. If this action is taken, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor in writing.<br />g. MWEOC facility access for deliveries:<br />1) Contractor's shall submit the MOUNT WEATHER ACCESS APPLICATION form through the COTR or GPOC at least seventy-two (72) business hours in advance of all shipments scheduled for delivery to the MWEOC. The COTR or GPOC will forward the access application to the Mt. Weather Emergency Services Division for processing.<br />2) Deliveries to the warehouse receiving area will be accepted on regular workdays, between the hours of 7:00 AM and 3:00 PM. Deliveries beyond these hours must be coordinated through the COTR or GPOC and will depend on available warehouse personnel.<br />3) Deliveries to other areas within the MWEOC facility may be made at anytime provided that the COTR, GPOC or Contractor Point of Contact is available and willing to accept delivery. It is the Contractor's responsibility to coordinate deliveries with the COTR or GPOC to ensure MWEOC access is granted and the delivery will be accepted. MWEOC is not responsible for delays or deliveries that cannot be made because the Contractor fails to observe these procedures.<br />4) Contractor's making deliveries on a fixed schedule may submit a single access application for each delivery employee and provide information for a regular delivery schedule. Delivery schedule changes must be reported immediately to the COTR or GPOC.<br />h. Requesting intermittent unescorted access: MWEOC Emergency Services Division will perform National Crime Information Center (NCIC) checks to screen individuals for intermittent unescorted temporary access. The following requirements apply:<br />1) The need for intermittent unescorted access must be work related and temporary in nature (less than 180 days) with no Government IT system access. If the need for intermittent unescorted access exceeds 180 days additional security checks must be completed and may include fingerprinting.<br />2) Intermittent unescorted access exceeding 180 days (not to exceed 1 year) and ANY access to Government IT systems will require a favorable fingerprint check from FEMA Headquarters Security prior to access being granted. This may take one to three weeks.<br />3) If the NCIC check indicates the applicant meets FEMA established "Pre-Employment Screening Guidance for Suitability" for temporary access, intermittent unescorted access will be granted immediately by the issuance of a "Daily Temporary Visitors" badge. If a prospective visitor has a background or clearance with the Contractor or other Government agency, their Contract Security Office shall fax the information to FEMA Headquarters Security at 202-646-2890 and the MWEOC Emergency Services Division at 540-542-2067<br />4) Any NCIC check which does not meet the "Pre-Employment Screening Guidance for Suitability" for temporary access is cause for immediate denial of access. An unfavorable NCIC check will require fingerprinting if requested by COTR or GPOC for possible mitigation. Fingerprint submission to FEMA Headquarters Security is necessary for approval determination. If this is required, no access will be granted until the individual is approved by FEMA Headquarters.

<DESC><p>The above solicitation is hereby amended to incorporate quantity and technical changes to Line Item 0001 and include revised drawing (044-0002-2) drawing 044-002 is hereby deleted. The due date/time, January 27, 2011 @ 3pm EST remains unchanged.</p>
<p>The quantity and technical changes for Line Item 0001 are as follows:</p>
<p>FROM:<br /><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a block of pure bismuth to be used as filter material. <br /><br />The Department of Commerce and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have developed a major national facility for neutron scattering. This project provides for over fifteen unique instrument stations for use by national and international researchers for materials research. In addition, instruments are also provided for fundamental physics research, neutron interferometry, and neutron optics.</p>
<p>To remain at the forefront of science, the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is continuously developing new and improved instruments for neutron scattering. NIST requires an accurately dimensioned rectangular block made from pure, single-crystal bismuth. This bismuth block shall be cryogenically cooled and shall be located upstream of a new instrument named the Chromatic Analysis Neutron Diffractometer or Reflectometer (CANDOR) and shall be used as a gamma ray filter for CANDOR. <br /><br />This block of pure bismuth shall be made up of several large crystals and shall be used to filter out unwanted gamma rays from the neutron beam. Single-crystal bismuth is known to be affective in attenuating gamma rays whose high energy can distort the purity of the thermal neutrons. Single crystal and large crystal bismuth has much higher transmission of neutrons between .4nm and .8nm than small crystal (fine grained) polycrystalline due to the minimization of Bragg scattering by reducing the number of individual crystals. Cooling the bismuth has the effect of making the crystals become nearly transparent to thermal neutrons and remain nearly opaque to high energy gamma rays.</p>
<p>All responsible quoters shall provide a quotation for the following line item:</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each, bismuth block (that shall be made up of several large single crystals), which satisfies the material and end product specifications defined herein to achieve the desired performance as a gamma ray filter.</p>
<p>(A) Bulk Materials Specification:</p>
<p>CAS No.: The bismuth used shall be in accordance with the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number 7440-69-9.<br />Purity: The bismuth must be 99.999% pure.</p>
<p>(B) Crystal End Product Specification:</p>
<p>Crystal Characteristics: One structure that is composed of several large crystals shall be grown, that will be irregularly shaped, eg some round and some rectangular. The minimum dimension of any irregular shape shall be 25mm.</p>
<p>Process Characteristics: After the structure of large crystals has been grown, it shall be cut, machined, fine ground and etched (to remove the deformed layer and reveal crystal boundaries) to the Physical Dimensions described in Section C. <br /><br />Density: The density of the end product shall be within 0.5% of the theoretical density of bismuth to ensure that there are not significant voids in the material. The room temperature density of bismuth is 9.78 g/cm&sup3;.</p>
<p>Physical Characteristics: The following specifications ensure that the bismuth block can be mounted as a mechanical body without shedding toxic parts:</p>
<p>1. Shear Modulus - 1,700 kpsi<br />2. Young's Modulus - 4,500 kpsi<br />3. No cracks permissible<br />4. Largest dimension of corner or edge chip &lt; 2mm<br />5. Number of chips allowable with size less than 2mm, 6-8 per piece</p>
<p>( C) Physical Dimensions: <br />The material shall be delivered as one accurately dimensioned block. The physical dimensions, tolerances and surface finish are specified on the attached drawing 044-0002.</p>
<p>TO:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for two blocks of pure bismuth to be used as filter material.</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have developed a major national facility for neutron scattering. This project provides for over fifteen unique instrument stations for use by national and international researchers for materials research. In addition, instruments are also provided for fundamental physics research, neutron interferometry, and neutron optics.</p>
<p>To remain at the forefront of science, the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is continuously developing new and improved instruments for neutron scattering. NIST requires two accurately dimensioned, identical rectangular blocks made from pure, single-crystal bismuth. These bismuth blocks shall be cryogenically cooled and shall be located upstream of a new instrument named the Chromatic Analysis Neutron Diffractometer or Reflectometer (CANDOR) and shall be used as a gamma ray filter for CANDOR.</p>
<p>These 2 blocks of pure bismuth shall be made up of several large crystals and shall be used to filter out unwanted gamma rays from the neutron beam. Single-crystal bismuth is known to be affective in attenuating gamma rays whose high energy can distort the purity of the thermal neutrons. Single crystal and large crystal bismuth has much higher transmission of neutrons between .4nm and .8nm than small crystal (fine grained) polycrystalline due to the minimization of Bragg scattering by reducing the number of individual crystals. Cooling the bismuth has the effect of making the crystals become nearly transparent to thermal neutrons and remain nearly opaque to high energy gamma rays.</p>
<p>All responsible quoters shall provide a quotation for the following line item:</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity two (2), bismuth blocks (that shall be made up of several large single crystals), which satisfies the material and end product specifications defined herein to achieve the desired performance as a gamma ray filter.</p>
<p>(A) Bulk Materials Specification:</p>
<p>CAS No.: The bismuth used shall be in accordance with the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number 7440-69-9.<br />Purity: The bismuth must be 99.999% pure.</p>
<p>(B) Crystal End Product Specification:</p>
<p>Crystal Characteristics: Two structures that are composed of several large crystals shall be grown. These crystals will be irregularly shaped, eg some round and some rectangular,(Note: the average size of a crystal will be around 25mm but there is no minimum dimension because the shapes are too irregular).</p>
<p>Process Characteristics: After the two blocks of large crystals have been grown, they shall be cut, machined, fine ground and etched (to remove the deformed layer and reveal crystal boundaries) to the Physical Dimensions described in Section C. <br /><br />Density: The density of the end product shall be within 0.5% of the theoretical density of bismuth to ensure that there are not significant voids in the material.

<p>TITLE: Planning, Scheduling and Assessing Space Command and Control (C2) Operations</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>FUNDING OPPORTUNITY NUMBER: BAA 10-05-RIKA</p>
<p>CFDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The objective of the Planning, Scheduling and Assessing Space Command and Control (C2) Operations BAA is to provide the Space Operations Centers with the ability to plan, task, synchronize, execute and assess the effectiveness of space capabilities to achieve desired effects within the battle space. This BAA represents the space component of the Command and Control Core Technical Competency's (C2 CTC) Integrated C2 concept.</p>
<p>The scope of this BAA is to develop and demonstrate technologies which will enable <br />Space Superiority. Space Superiority can be defined as efficient, timely integration of space situational awareness (SSA) and command and control (C2) in order to more effectively task space control capabilities. Space C2 functions enable commanders to plan, direct, coordinate, synchronize and control operations of assigned forces. Technologies are needed for improvement of Space Operations at the strategic, operational and tactical levels, in the areas of planning, tasking, execution and assessment capabilities associated with the space tasking cycle starting with commander's intent and ending with assessment. White papers are being sought that provide enhanced event monitoring and task execution, situational assessment, automated decision aids for better course of action analysis and selection, dynamic resource management, timely feedback to assess effectiveness of on-going global operations and agile C2 enterprise management system approaches to allow more adaptable and resilient operations to systems degradations or limited available resources. Technologies must be compatible with Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and clearly demonstrate Measure of Performance (MOP) and Measures of Effectiveness (MOE) of the end product.</p>
<p>Developing innovative and critical technologies necessary to enhance the planning, scheduling and assessing of Space C2 capabilities and the ability to provide a seamless path to overall integration with air, and cyber C2 assets synchronized to achieve effects globally in support of theater commanders are desired.</p>
<p>This BAA is comprised of the following areas of which an offeror may respond to one or more:</p>
<p>1.0 Effects Based Planning and Scheduling for Space Operations</p>
<p>Decision-makers must have a clear idea of what it is they are trying to accomplish, what actions might be taken and how the proposed actions will contribute to some desired end state. They must also have some reasonable explanation of why they expect the operations to work. It is critical that we determine that the action or actions taken are creating the effect we want both spatially and temporally. Prior to and after the fact, as we perform actions, we want to make sure that our battle space understanding is still relevant (Did the situation change). This change may negate the effect we want to achieve from the actions planned. To determine this, we need to be collecting robust space situational awareness (SSA) information combined with other information sources to assure ourselves that the effects that we are trying to achieve are obtainable. We need all source fusion of information to reach timely situation awareness and knowledge. Finally, agility will be the key to success. We need to dynamically and in time synchronize our actions to achieve desired effects.</p>
<p>This focus area is soliciting innovative approaches to develop a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) compliant capability for space C2 Course of Action (COA) planning and evaluation for use in real world, exercise, and training situations. The system capability should aid the operator in determining the feasibility of the plan/COA to achieve the commander's intent. Key capability is to enable the planner to apportion low density, high demand resources to meet global needs. Novel approaches are encouraged that will allow operators to easily interact with the capability and develop credible results while managing uncertainty. Key metrics are machine to machine population of model parameters, agility to handle different scenarios, use of templates/knowledge bases to speed planning process, and understandable results clearly showing risk/benefits of each COA developed and analyzed.</p>
<p>2.0 Assessment</p>
<p>Assessment can be loosely defined as the ability to understand the status of our capabilities with respect to natural (weather) or manmade anomalies as well as effects we intend to achieve as a result of our actions. Key to analyzing these effects will be the ability to clearly define well understood Measures of Effective (MOE) and Measures of Performance (MOP). Related to this capability is the need to track and monitor use of our resources and make adjustments in response to the dynamics of the situation. This focus area is soliciting approaches for the means to accurately define the effects that can be achieved based on resources available and objectives, which in turn drives indicators of achievement of those effects, which in turn will drive the need to accommodate any plan changes. Novel approaches for achieving mission assurance against all anomalies to ensure successful operations are of interest. Furthermore, the capabilities developed must address the dynamic feedback between planning, execution and assessment.</p>
<p>3.0 Common Integrated Flexible Satellite Operations (SATOPS) Command &amp; Control (C2)</p>
<p>Many C2 challenges exist with the current SATOPS enterprise such as lack of standardization and divergent stovepipe implementations of SATOPS for specific systems. These stand alone designs hinder the ability to accomplish cross-mission data fusion, prevent application reuse and sharing, and create the need for manpower-intensive operations. A common integrated flexible SATOPS C2 capability that could combine tasks common to multiple SATOPS systems, share mission data for integration within a SOA, and be flexible enough for both future expansion and incorporation of legacy systems is desired. This focus area is soliciting approaches in three areas: (1) - Research that explores the data sharing architecture most suited to handle worldwide, multi-user, high bandwidth, near real time distribution of satellite data over secure networks; (2) - Research that explores consolidated C2 systems flexible enough to execute mission requirements for legacy systems, recently fielded systems, and future systems; and (3) - Research that explores the best combination of bus and payload C2 functions to consolidate and to minimize both manpower and training. Research should explore recommendations of in-family satellite systems (SATCOM, Weather, Missile Warning, PNT, and Imagery) and cross-family recommendations.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately $20.5M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY10 - $1.0M, FY11 - $3.3M; FY12 - $4.9M; FY13 - $6.0M; FY14 - $5.3M. Individual awards will not normally exceed 36 months with dollar amounts normally ranging between $400K to $1.5M per year. There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value. Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements depending upon the nature of the work proposed.</p>

In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, their Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, a fax number, an e-mail address, and reference BAA 10-05-IFKA with their submission. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the technical POC, as discussed in paragraph six of this section.</p>
<p>3. SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES: It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 10 should be submitted by 1 Apr 2010; FY11 by 2 Aug 2010; FY12 by 1 Sept 2011; FY13 by 3 Sept 2012 and FY14 by 2 Sept 2013. White papers will be accepted until 2pm Eastern time on 02 Sep 2014, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.</p>
<p>4. FUNDING RESTRICTIONS: The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS).</p>
<p>5. All Proposers should review the NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM OPERATING MANUAL, (NISPOM), dated February 28, 2006 as it provides baseline standards for the protection of classified information and prescribes the requirements concerning Contractor Developed Information under paragraph 4-105. Defense Security Service (DSS) Site for the NISPOM is: <br />https://www.dss.mil/portal/ShowBinary/BEA%20Repository/new_dss_internet//isp/fac_clear/download_nispom.html.</p>
<p>6. OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Capt David Sampayan, AFRL/RISA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441 or 1LT Peter Rozwood, AFRL/RISA, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441.</p>
<p>Electronic submission to Capt David Sampayan at David.Sampayan@rl.af.mil or 1Lt Peter Rozwood at Peter.Rozwood@rl.af.mil will also be accepted.</p>
<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- The extent to which the offeror&lsquo;s approach demonstrates overall scientific and technical merit for the development and/or enhancement of the technology, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require up to a TS-SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access up to TS SCI information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use. Please note that use of the JIFFY or TFIMS application requires customers outside of the .mil domain to purchase an approved External Certificate Authority certificate to facilitate a secured log on process. It is necessary to obtain an ECA certificate BEFORE obtaining a JIFFY or TFIMS user account. Additional information on obtaining an ECA is available at: http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:</p>
<p>Capt David Sampayan or 1Lt Peter Rozwood<br />Telephone: (315) 330-3996 or (315) 330-7412<br />Email: David.Sampayan@rl.af.mil or Peter.Rozwood@rl.af.mil</p>

<p>In accordance with AFFARS 5315.90, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (Apr 2010) will be incorporated into all contracts awarded under this BAA. The AFRL Ombudsman is as follows:</p>
<p>Susan Hunter<br />Building 15, Room 225<br />1864 Fourth Street<br />Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130<br />FAX: (937) 225-5036; Comm: (937) 904-4407</p>

"Qualification requirement," as used in this clause, means a Government requirement for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be completed before award.(b) One or more qualification requirements apply to the supplies or services covered by this contract. For those supplies or services requiring qualification, whether the covered product or service is an end item under this contract or simply a component of an end item, the product, manufacturer, or source must have demonstrated that it meets the standards prescribed for qualification before award of this contract. The product, manufacturer, or source must be qualified at the time of award whether or not the name of the product, manufacturer, or source is actually included on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list. Offerors should contact the agency activity designated below to obtain all requirements that they or their products or services, or their subcontractors or their products or services, must satisfy to become qualified and to arrange for an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification. OC-ALC/BC ATTN: SOURCE DEVELOPMENT OFICE 3001 STAFF DRIVE STE 1AG85A TINKER AIR FORCE BASE, OK 73145-3009 405-739-7244 OR 405-739-7243 (c) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service covered by a qualification requirement has already met the standards specified, the relevant information noted below should be provided.Offeror's Name _______________________________Manufacturer's Name __________________________Source's Name _______________________________Item Name __________________________________Service Identification __________________________Test Number ______________________________ (to the extent known)(d) Even though a product or service subject to a qualification requirement is not itself an end item under this contract, the product, manufacturer, or source must nevertheless be qualified at the time of award of this contract. This is necessary whether the Contractor or a subcontractor will ultimately provide the product or service in question. If, after award, the Contracting Officer discovers that an applicable qualification requirement was not in fact met at the time of award, the Contracting Officer may either terminate this contract for default or allow performance to continue if adequate consideration is offered and the action is determined to be otherwise in the Government's best interests.(e) If an offeror, manufacturer, source, product or service has met the qualification requirement but is not yet on a qualified products list, qualified manufacturers list, or qualified bidders list, the offeror must submit evidence of qualification prior to award of this contract. Unless determined to be in the Government's interest, award of this contract shall not be delayed to permit an offeror to submit evidence of qualification.(f) Any change in location or ownership of the plant where a previously qualified product or service was manufactured or performed requires reevaluation of the qualification. Similarly, any change in location or ownership of a previously qualified manufacturer or source requires reevaluation of the qualification. The reevaluation must be accomplished before the date of award.52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers: 1. Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement2. Past Performance 3. Cost/Price Technical and past performance, when combined are approximately equal to cost or price. (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice. This announcement is for market research and preliminary planning purposes. No proposals are being requested or accepted in response to this notice. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS NOTICE. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice or any follow up information requests.
<p><br />1 Introduction</p>
<p>The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) is an independent bureau within the Federal Reserve System that was created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The CFPB works to promote fairness and transparency for mortgages, credit cards, and other consumer financial products and services. The CFPB currently employs approximately 200 people and will ultimately employ approximately 1200 people. The CFPB is currently headquartered at 1801 L Street, NW, Washington, D.C. with the potential of temporarily locating staff at other Washington, D.C. facilities.</p>
<p>1.1 Overview</p>
<p>The overall objective is to acquire a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) asset management product that provides a web-based solution to support an automated Property/Inventory Management System (PIMS), utilizing barcode technology to facilitate the collection, management, transfer/movement, storage, and disposition of property. The solution shall use web specific technologies that allow for simple deployment and management requiring only a web browser and connectivity to a web server (via intranet/internet, VPN, etc.) while eliminating the need for complicated software distribution processes. The foundation of the proposed PIMS is an automated, web-based asset management software application that resides on a CFPB server that incorporates barcode technology (hardware and software) to make property records more secure and to ensure strict security, management, control, and maintenance of the CFPB property inventory. The system must be capable of calculating depreciation of capitalized purchases (to include single capitalized items as well as bulk capitalized purchases).</p>
<p>The specific objectives of the project are to:</p>
<p>Identify a barcode-based asset/property management solution that will provide a means to electronically track an unlimited number of assets of various types to replace the current manual means of managing accountable property.</p>
<p>Deploy a customizable COTS-based solution that provides the CFPB with the capabilities to enhance or expand the barcoding software, as needed. CFPB administrator(s) shall be able to add custom fields (text boxes, list boxes, and check boxes) and hide unused fields without any additional development/programming costs.</p>
<p><br />The software shall be flexible enough to allow user-defined fields in addition to the out-of-the-box fields based on the business workflow of property management processes which will be shared with the vendor during the requirements gathering phase to support the required system functionality.</p>
<p>Deliver a system that will be utilized in any/all CFPB field offices nationwide to log property and assets and generate forms and reports remotely.</p>
<p>Import data into existing enterprise applications from the PIMS. Therefore, PIMS must be able to export data into .CSV (comma separated values) format, .XLS, .PDF, .DOC, etc. so that data can be imported to other applications as necessary.</p>
<p>2 High Level Features</p>
<p>The features described below outline the desired functionality for the Inventory Management System:<br />&bull; Generate a property receipt used to document actions such as property transfers or dispositions - printable using standard letter size paper and signature blocks.</p>
<p>&bull; Provide a log system to track common inventory management duties such as property acquisitions, transfers, dispositions, etc.</p>
<p>&bull; Electronically transmit documents using internet/intranet communications shall be limited to the use VPN technology.</p>
<p>&bull; Create barcode labels to affix to assets/property.</p>
<p>&bull; Allow users to generate a series of system generated and user defined viewable and printable ad-hoc and pre-defined forms and reports from various data sources in the system with pre-defined logic and layouts, to include daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/annual management and statistical reports, exception reports, audit trail, all property/item transfers and dispositions, number of items entered per year, number of items purged per year.</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to generate custom reports for any fields entered using report writing tools compatible with the COTS application software.</p>
<p>&bull; Reports have dynamic filters (based on the report type) that allow users to generate filtered, ad-hoc type output based on their needs for tracking property.</p>
<p>&bull; Support data entry utilizing laptop computers for both remote locations and for office use.</p>
<p>&bull; Generate a list of property and create barcode labels reflecting the designated unique property/record number for the item. These labels will be affixed to the property when property is received.</p>
<p>&bull; The system barcode scanner hardware will read labels for inventory purposes and generate reports based on various requirements (date range, locations, property type, etc.)</p>
<p>&bull; Allow bulk scanning of labels to perform operations such as disposition and reporting.</p>
<p>&bull; All transactions/edits/deletions/system management actions are tracked through an auditing system.</p>
<p>&bull; Automatic control number generation (i.e. a unique system-generated identifier for each asset).<br />&bull; Property entry with strict validation rules.</p>
<p>&bull; System-generated alert functions to notify users of specific property actions that are generated via email clients such as Microsoft Outlook. The alert actions and notifications could vary by asset type or other pre-determined parameters (some of which may be user-defined).</p>
<p>&bull; Document management - ability to store scanned pictures and import/upload digital photographs and Microsoft Word and .PDF documents.</p>
<p>&bull; Standardization - drop down menus for categories and item descriptions.</p>
<p>&bull; Ability for designated CFPB system administrator(s) to add unlimited locations and users (also the ability to set access privileges as needed).</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to structure a query on a variety of criteria.</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to sort information on any field.</p>
<p>&bull; Windows-based navigation functionality.</p>
<p>&bull; Maintain comprehensive logs of changes made to any record, complete with the old and new versions, date, and user identification.</p>
<p>&bull; Support tickler capabilities that can be set to follow internal policy requirements (e.g. 30 days, 60 days, etc.)</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to calculate depreciation of capitalized assets, based on acquisition date, cost, and depreciation schedule (in months).</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to link individual items to a centrally-capitalized entry (e.g. notebook computers), calculate depreciation, modify depreciation formula of bulk capitalized items, and adjusting appropriately upon disposal/loss of an individual item.</p>
<p>&bull; The barcode system must have the ability to capture information contained in various forms, including these fields:</p>
<p>&#61656; Property ID field<br />&#61656; Property/item description<br />&#61656; Property type<br />&#61656; Field office housing property (office code table)<br />&#61656; Where property was obtained <br />&#61656; Who inventoried property<br />&#61656; Where property is stored/used<br />&#61656; Capitalized items<br />&#61656; If capitalized, bulk or single<br />&#61656; Purchase order or other reference number<br />&#61656; Date Received<br />&#61656; Description/type of Property (built in pull-down tables and open text fields)<br />&#61656; Actual/Estimated Value <br />&#61656; Comments/Notes</p>
<p>&bull; The system must have the ability to document the history of an item from receipt to disposal to include initial receipt, assignment, reassignment, and physical relocation.</p>
<p>The following describes the non-functional requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Allow an unlimited number of digital images to be uploaded to support a property item, so a visual record of the property can be documented.</p>
<p>&bull; Performance of web-based application when accessed over WAN network.</p>
<p>&bull; The system must have the ability to track software and software licensing.</p>
<p>&bull; The system must have the ability to interface with Oracle Financial Systems.</p>
<p>3 Key Design Principles</p>
<p>CFPB is focusing on the following key design principles in structuring a program to meet these needs:</p>
<p>&bull; Web-based COTS asset/property management system product to be installed in the CFPB environment.</p>
<p>&bull; Portable handheld barcode scanners with wireless capabilities that incorporate both wireless and Bluetooth technologies allowing communication with workstations and allow users the ability to transmit/upload data without being docked or attached to workstations.</p>
<p>&bull; The solution must be compatible with the CFPB technical environment described above. Contractor shall work with the hosting provider to install and setup the software in the CFPB's cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>&bull; The application must be compatible and interface with a Microsoft Windows Active Directory.</p>
<p>&bull; The front-end must be customizable.</p>
<p>&bull; The data must be query-able by nSQL.</p>
<p>&bull; Database must be exportable to standard format like CSV.</p>
<p>&bull; CFPB's preference is for solutions with the following general characteristics:</p>
<p>&#61656; Technology stack supports open standards and with broad adoption is the marketplace.<br />&#61656; Architecture enables extensions and customizations without requiring enhancements.<br />&#61656; Architecture enables data to be integrated or shared with other applications and data repositories.<br />&#61656; Architecture allows end users to access applications through web and/or mobile interfaces over SSL VPN.<br />&#61656; Supports use of external identity and access management solutions to control user access to the application.</p>
<p>4 Stakeholders<br />It is envisioned the Administrative Operations office will be the owner of the system. In addition, various offices will be key users of this application to include the Information and Technology office and the Finance office.</p>

The sole source award by contract modification is being issued through other than full and open competition procedures (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(B)) and will expire on September 13, 2010.

There is currently a large Army reset program in the works and any delay in the procurement process will impact readiness of the Up Armored HMMWV fleet.  These vehicles are those that are needed in support of SWA.  The current contract with BAE is helping us maintain a readiness rate of 92%.  With the contract currently in place with BAE, they can support these urgent requirements and can supply these items with a delivery of 5-10 days (depending on Priority code) directly to the customer. It is in the Governments best interest to make this sole source award to BAE Survivability Systems.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS AMENDED TO REVISE THE PROPOSAL DUE DATE AND PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT. 

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) anticipates that Request for Proposals (RFP) No. NHLBI-HB-11-02 will be available on or about October 23, 2009.  The solicitation will be for the Data Coordinating Center for the program entitled Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study  III (REDS-III).  It is anticipated that one award will be made in January 2011 for a period of seven years.  

The objectives of the REDS-III program are to assure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S. affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S. but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. 

NHLBI plans to support one data coordinating center, one central laboratory, up to four domestic hubs, and up to 4 international collaborative programs involving U.S. investigators and investigators at international blood centers.  THIS NOTICE ADDRESSES THE DATA COORDINATING CENTER ONLY.

The REDS-III program will target the following blood banking and transfusion medicine areas: 1) donor targeted strategies; 2) blood banking; 3) transfusion practices in adult patients; and 4) education and training.  The goal of this highly structured, multi-center, donor-recipient epidemiology, laboratory, and clinical outcomes program is to advance public health by conducting critical research to improve transfusion practices and the safety and adequacy of the blood supply in the U.S. and in countries affected by the AIDS epidemic.  The program will include large survey, epidemiological and laboratory investigations. Clinical trials in potential recipients of blood products are NOT within the purview of the REDS-III program.  The research portfolios of the REDS-III Domestic and International programs will be fashioned in response to contemporary scientific questions which need to be addressed to advance blood transfusion safety in the U.S. and in countries where REDS-III international blood centers are located.  It is expected that about one third of the studies conducted in the REDS-III Domestic program will address donor and/or donation safety and availability issues, and other blood banking questions; and that about two thirds of the investigations will address adult transfusion recipient safety concerns.  Most studies performed in the international setting, however, are expected to address blood banking concerns including donor and/or donation safety and availability issues although a small number of studies might address transfusion recipient safety concerns. Comprehensive databases including information on donors and their donations/components (required for the Domestic and International programs), and on adult patients considered for, or receiving a transfusion (required for the Domestic program only) will enable study investigators with the necessary scientific and analytical expertise to address in a timely fashion, important scientific issues in blood banking and transfusion medicine.

The domestic hubs and the international programs shall be supported by a DCC which shall be responsible for overall coordination, communications, data management, and analytical/statistical support. The domestic hubs and the international programs shall also be supported by a central laboratory which shall be responsible for the necessary infectious disease, molecular, genetic, immunological, hematological, and other testing conducted in the U.S., and for serving as the REDS-III biospecimen repository.  

The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) shall compile donation and patient data from the domestic centers (i.e., hubs) in 1) a centralized cumulative donor/donation/component database; 2) a centralized cumulative patient database; and 3) a centralized cumulative linked donor-recipient database that shall link all information on donors and their donations/components to information on the patients who received these components. The hub Centralized Data Collection Center (CCC) shall provide to the DCC the links that shall allow for the data from the donors, their donations and components to be linked with data on the recipients who received them.  It will be desirable that at least 20,000 RBC transfusion exposures occur per year at each hubs participating hospitals/outpatient clinics.  It would also be desirable, although not required, that the consortium of hospitals participating in the hub admitted the following minimum number of cross-matched adult patients each year at the following hospital services: 1) intensive care units: 1,000; 2) cardiac surgery, 1,000;  3) orthopedic surgery,  500; 4) oncology/cancer center, 1,000; and  5) trauma service, 1,000.  Each hubs blood center must collect at least 75,000 allogeneic blood donations per year.  Analysis of all data compiled in the databases shall be conducted by the DCC.  Additionally, the DCC shall be responsible for coordination, data management, and analytical/statistical support of an estimated five large epidemiological and/or survey studies and about ten laboratory studies [which may or may not be component(s) of the large epidemiological studies] during the course of the domestic program. 

The DCC shall compile donor and donation data from each international site in a centralized cumulative donor/donation database and shall be responsible for providing all statistical/analytical support for the analysis of these data. The blood centers participating in each international program must collect a total of at least 250,000 blood donations annually from at least three collaborating foreign collection sites located in a low or middle income country affected by the AIDS epidemic. Each foreign blood collection site must collect a minimum of 25,000 donations annually. Analysis of all data compiled in the database shall be conducted by the DCC. Additionally, the DCC shall be responsible for coordination, data management, and analytical/statistical support of an estimated three large epidemiological and/or survey studies and about three laboratory studies [which may or may not be component(s) of the large epidemiological studies] conducted at each of the REDS-III international collaborative programs. 

The DCC shall perform the following study requirements: 1) coordinate REDS-III activities and participate as a member of the Oversight and Steering Committees to develop and implement a coordinated plan to achieve program objectives; 2) develop and maintain operating procedures for the REDS-III program; 3) develop and maintain a public and private REDS-III website; 4) develop and finalize the protocols and associated Manuals of Operations for the cumulative centralized databases; 5) coordinate and participate in the development and finalization of REDS-III study protocols and develop corresponding Manuals of Operations;  6) provide all necessary data management and tracking systems; 7) track all REDS-III biospecimens  and their associated data, and identify biospecimens for retrieval; 8) provide training sessions and conduct site visits, as appropriate; 9) provide biostatistical support during protocol development and analyze database and study data collected during REDS-III; 10) assist the Oversight Committee and Steering Committees in preparation of scientific reports for publication and presentation; 11) help coordinate and convene the REDS-III Observational Study Monitoring Board (OSMB),  provide administrative and logistic support for OSMB meetings/calls, prepare and present data reports to the OSMB, and prepare minutes of the sessions; 12) coordinate and convene the REDS-III External Review Panel,  assist the NHLBI COTR(s) with the selection and invitation of the External Review Panel, provide administrative and logistic support for the External Review Panel meetings, prepare minutes from External Panel  sessions and coordinate and pay for External Review Panel members travel and honorarium; 13) prepare quarterly and annual technical reports;  14) interact with the COTR(s) on programmatic research activity issues; 15) At close-out of the study, or earlier as directed by the COTR(s), create public use data sets for each data collection activity with documentation; and 16) ensure an orderly transition of REDS-III resources to a successor contractor at contract expiration.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Contracts Department (AIR 2.5.1.2), Patuxent River, MD announces its intent to conduct a site visit at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Webster Field Annex. This site visit is being held to provide information regarding a government requirement to procure support services for the Joint Precision Approach and Landing Systems (JPALS) System Development and Demonstration phase (SD&amp;D), Navy Unmanned Combat Aerial Systems (NUCAS), Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS), Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS), War Fighter Networking (WFN), Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)/Ground Based Sense and Avoid (GBSAA) and Automated Aerial Refueling (AAR). This requirement will include research and development in the performance of prototype development and testing. <br />
<p><br />A sources sought was conducted in August of 2010 and as a result, the Procuring Contracting Officer determined that this requirement would be competed on a full and open basis. A 20% small business subcontracting requirement will be placed on all large business submitting proposals. The Government intends to release a formal solicitation in May of 2011.</p>
<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Air Traffic Control (ATC) Systems Division, Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Department (NAWCAD) Patuxent River Code 4.5.8, located at St. Inigoes, MD is the In-Service Engineering Agent (ISEA) and Software Support Activity (SSA) for Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATC&amp;LS). The ATC Division provides systems engineering support to developmental programs such as the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS), Navy Unmanned Combat Air System (N-UCAS) and Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance (UCLASS) programs. The JPALS program is developing the next generation air traffic control and landing system for Navy air-capable ships as well as providing the Precision Global Positioning System (PGPS) solution for N-UCAS/UCLASS auto-land functions. Satisfactory performance of the system will depend on both aircraft and shipboard algorithms that can adequately integrate Global Positioning System (GPS) and inertial sensor outputs through a robust data link.</p>
<p>NAWCAD 4.5.8 is tasked to prototype, test, integrate and evaluate JPALS equipment, into aircraft and ship platforms. During the Technology Development (TD) phase, JPALS prototyping will be conducted. This will require the installation and integration of JPALS components into test aircraft, JPALS Mobile Test Vehicle (JMTV), and into two test facilities (the Satellite Navigation (SATNAV) Facility and Technical Evaluation Center (SAFTEC), and the Landing Systems Test Facility (LSTF) JPALS extension, B2110) that were developed during the on-going TD phase. Support of this testing requires the management and operation of the test facility at NAS Patuxent River, MD, and the mobile test facility for the JPALS program.</p>
<p>The N-UCAS/UCLASS program is a Navy effort to demonstrate the technical feasibility, military utility and operational value for a networked system of high performance, weaponized Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) to effectively and affordably prosecute combat missions. The Northrop Grumman X-47 platform is the current candidate UAV system being evaluated for the N-UCAS effort, the UCLASS air vehicle is currently TBD.. Key parts of the integration of these unmanned air vehicles into the military force structure is an auto-land capability, incorporation within military air traffic control, Automated Aerial Refueling (AAR), and Warfighter Networking (WFN) development. Program activities will include efforts to simulate system performance, evaluate sensor units in operational environments, prototype ATC interfaces, and provide operator feedback geared toward anticipated landing on a carrier suitable platform. NAWCAD 4.5.8 is tasked to prototype and integrate the auto-land function, ATC interface, and AAR into aircraft and ship platforms as appropriate and conduct testing. This will require the installation of these components into civil and military aircraft, Navy Aircraft Carrier (CVN) and Amphibious Assault (LH) platforms, the LSTF JPALS extension, the N-UCAS Aviation/Ship Integration Facility (NASIF), and the N-UCAS Mobile Test Platform (UMTP). Support of this testing will require the use of multiple mobile test vehicles requiring prototyping and integration efforts, and the set up and operation of the required test facilities.</p>
<p>This requirement is a follow-on procurement to contract N00178-04-D-4143-M803 currently being performed by L-3 Services. The existing contract is Cost Plus Fixed Fee Seaport-e Task Order. This task order is due to expire 8 December 2011.</p>
<p>Award of this requirement will result in a Multiple Award Contract (MAC). The number of contracts awarded as a result of this solicitation depends on the number of awardable proposals received. Subsequent task orders to complete tasking within the Performance Based Work Statement (PBWS) will be competed among the MAC awardees.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide technical products and engineering services in the above mentioned areas in support of the areas specified in Program Background (above). Further detail is provided in the updated draft PBWS dated 3-9-2011, attached to this announcement.</p>
<p>ELIGIBILITY</p>
<p>The applicable NAICS Code for this requirement is 541330 with a Small Business Size threshold of $27.0 Million. Businesses of all sizes are encouraged to respond.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND SUBMISSION DETAILS (SITE VISIT)</p>
<p>NAWCAD, ATC&amp;LS, intends to hold a site visit onboard the Patuxent River Naval Air Base, Webster Field Annex in St. Inigoes, MD, on 31 March 2011. The site visit will start at 1 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST). This scheduled site visit will enable potential Offerors to further understand the history behind the JPALS, NUCAS, and UCLASS equipment.

Also, predict the ground shock from impact and the coupled blast.<br><br>3. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:<br><br>3.1 Offerors must have the ability to provide services that may require access and development of information that is restricted but unclassified as well as classified as Confidential or Secret. Therefore, offeror must have at a minimum a secret security clearance.<br><br>3.2 Security at Government Installations. When site visits are conducted at Government installations, the Contractor shall comply with the security requirements of the installation.<br><br>4. EVALUATION RATINGS: <br><br>4.1 Ratings. The application of a scale of words will be used in conjunction with narrative, to denote the degree to which the proposal has met the standard for a criteria evaluation factor. For purposes of this solicitation, ratings will consist of words (adjectival method) used in conjunction with narratives. Ratings will be applied at the criterion and sub-criterion level. If at any level of indentation an Offers submittal is evaluated as not meeting a minimum requirements stated for the criteria (that is, below the level of Satisfactory),the rating may be included in the rating and narrative assessment at that level and each higher level of indentation. Therefore, a Marginal or Unacceptable rating at any level may be carried to the criterion level. The following ratings will be used to evaluate the submitted information.<br><br>(i) Outstanding - Information submitted demonstrates offeror's potential to significantly exceed performance or capability standards. The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and highest quality performance is anticipated. Have exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government. The offeror's qualifications exceed the fullest expectations of the Government. The offeror has convincingly demonstrated that the announcement criteria requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when implemented, should result in outstanding, effective, efficient, and economical performance under an awarded contract. Significantly exceeds most or all announcement criteria requirements. There is a very high probability of success.<br><br>(ii) Above Average - Information submitted demonstrates offeror's potential to exceed performance or capability standards. Have one or more strengths that will benefit the Government. The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipated to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality. The offeror's qualifications meet and slightly exceed requirements. The submittal contains excellent features that will likely produce results very beneficial to the Government. The information submitted fully meets all announcement criteria requirements and significantly exceeds many of the announcement criteria requirements. Disadvantages are minimal. There is a high probability of success.<br><br>(iii) Satisfactory (Neutral) - Information submitted demonstrate offeror's potential to meet performance or capability standards. The information represents an acceptable solution. Either meets all announcement criteria requirements for the criterion (or sub-criterion) or contains weaknesses in some areas that are offset by strengths in other areas. A rating of Satisfactory indicates that, in terms of the specific criterion (or sub-criterion), the offeror has a good probability of success, as there is sufficient confidence that a fully compliant level of performance will be achieved. The submittal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the scope and depth of the announcement criteria requirements. No significant advantages or disadvantages, the submittal is neutral. There is a good probability of success.<br><br>(iv) Marginal - The submittal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific criterion (or sub-criterion) of the announcement. The offeror's interpretation of the Governments requirements is superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, or incorrect and therefore could be considered deficient. The submittal does not meet some of the minimum announcement requirements. The assignment of a rating within the bounds of Marginal indicates that a mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall project. The offeror's qualifications, plans or approach will likely result in questionable quality of performance, which represents a moderate level of risk to the Government. There is a low probability of success although the submittal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least acceptable. There are significant disadvantages.<br><br>(v) Unsatisfactory - The submittal fails to meet performance or capability standards. Announcement criteria requirements can only be met through a major revision and/or changes to the submittal. There is no reasonable expectation that acceptable performance would be achieved. The submittal contains many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; fails to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Governments requirements; and/or fails to meet most or all of the minimum announcement criteria requirements. There are very significant disadvantages.<br><br>5. SELECTION CRITERIA: <br><br>The selection criteria listed below are in shown in descending order of importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion). The following criteria, Paragraph a will be the primary evaluation criteria. Subparagraphs 1- 8 are listed in descending order of importance.

<MODNBR>0007
<ARCHDATE>04082011
<DESC>This action is to extend Bridge Contract W91QVN-10-D-0024, in accordance with the Bridge Contract's 52.217-8 extension services clause, to continue services for USAMEDDAC-K Operation and Maintenance Services for all medical facilities located Korea-wide originally awarded under Contract W91QVN-10-D-0024.  This extension will be for two (2) months, from 2 March 2011 through 1 May 2011. The need for Hospital Operation and Maintenance services is critical to ensure continued required Joint Commission Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) certification and the ability of USFK to meet all medical mission requirements. USFK medical facilities serviced by the incumbent contractor provides the medical needs to all active duty service members and families, retirees, U.S. civilian government and contractor employees stationed in Korea. The Bridge Contract extension is needed to continue critical operations and maintenance services and to facilitate adequate time to award the follow-on contract. The delay in the award of the follow-on Hospital O&M contract is caused by recent changes in USAMEDDAC-K service requirements to include the move to in-source key positions currently occupied by contractor personnel and the issuance of the recent AT&L directive, Better Buying Power: Guidance for Obtaining Greater Efficiency and Productivity in Defense Spending released September 14, 2010 which requires increased acquisition lead time to promote competition. Despite the release of the new solicitation with a 30 day response time, multiple amendments were issued which extended the closing date of the solicitation.  The result of the extended closing date was that the award date for the new contract was pushed out beyond the current extension end date of 01 March 2011 requiring a final two month extension under FAR 52.217-8 from 02 March 2011 - 01 May 2011. The total cost of the Bridge Contract extension for the two month period of performance is $760,506.28.
