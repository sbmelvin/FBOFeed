The Government considers the acquisition of the entire Enhancement Kit to be more economical than ordering from individual manufacturers. The Government considered purchase order preparation coupled with preaward and post award administration factors in determining the potential duplication of costs are not expected to be recovered through competition of individual purchase orders. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. A purchase order will not be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. All inquiries shall be forwarded via email to the contact listed below by 4:00 PM, Mountain Time Zone, 30 March 2009.

- Wrench (Quantity 1, Product #1036W)
- CryoConsole Operators Manual for REF 104A2 (Quantity 1, Product #Current)

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures (IAW FAR 13.5).  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement.

This solicitation will be issued as an unrestricted acquisition with other than full and open competition.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract parts from approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1).

<a href="mailto:phyliss.schlegel@faa.gov">phyliss.schlegel@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center (WJHTC) needs additional time to prepare and conduct the re-competition of its "Center Operations and Maintenance Services" (COMS) requirements.  The existing contract with incumbent contractor All Star Technical Services, Inc. (All Star), DTFACT-04-C-00014, is subject to the Service Contract Act and cannot be extended beyond its 60-month life.  In order to ensure continuity of service, the FAA intends to issue a single-source contract to All Star which will bridge the DTFACT-04-C-00014 end date, 9/30/09, to the start date of the new, re-competed contract.  The bridge contract will contain a six-month base period and two, three-month options.
The bridge contract will, with some minor exceptions, require the contractor to perform the same services as those described in DTFACT-04-C-00014.  This work includes operations and maintenance services, minor repairs and alterations, for both WJHTC and, optionally, for tenant-owned facilities.  Contractor responsibilities will include fire detection, alarms and suppression systems; site utilities; heating and air-conditioning systems;  electrical distribution systems (primary and secondary, including substations); elevators; roofing; cafeteria equipment; interior and exterior finishes; central utility plants; motor vehicle and equipment maintenance; material handling; roads and parking lot pavement maintenance; hazardous waste removal; bulk trash removal; pest control; security cameras and card readers; intrusion detection systems and industrial cleaning.  
In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System 3.2.2.4, this announcement informs the public of the FAA's decision to enter into a single source contract with All Star Technical Services, Inc. of San Diego, CA.  This is a short-term contract which will permit additional time and analysis of the COMS requirements, including potential for some of the work to be set aside for small business, and will ultimately further FAA's policy of maximizing competition.  
All Star has provided COMS services for over four years and has all the requisite personnel, security clearances, licenses, equipment and other resources to seamlessly continue the work for the term proposed.  
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. All Star is the only known contractor who can provide uninterrupted COMS services for the proposed short term.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your capabilities to seamlessly provide all of the above-listed services for the FAA to evaluate.  
Responses must address how your firm will provide services--with no break in quality or timeliness of delivery--all the requisite labor, licenses, experience and capabilities required.  You must include references where you recently were successful performing work under similar conditions.  All responses to this announcement must be directed to Phyliss Schlegel no later than 12 noon, local time, April 6, 2009.  Address your responses to:  FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center, Acquisition & Grants Group, (Attn: P. Schlegel, AJA-4730), Atlantic City International Airport, New Jersey 08405.  Questions will be answered, if submitted via e-mail to:  Phyliss.Schlegel@FAA.Gov by close of business 3/30/09. Please include "DTFACT-09-R-00021" in the subject line.

<DESC>Requisition Number: FDA1054781

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeks a 100% small business set-aside for access to a medical drug database.   Award will be a firm-fixed price purchase order.

Background:  The FDA requires the procurement of a Medi-Span Master Drug Database v2.5 (MDDB) with 5 user licenses within one of our laboratories located in Rockville, MD.  The FDA will use MDDB to insure accuracy of data entry, completeness of drug product data, reconciliation of drug product status and in identification of drug products not known to the FDA.  Through a process of coding, safeguards shall be in place that insure integrity and preservation of data entered to satisfy 21 CFR 207.  FDA requires access to relevant data for purposes of identifying marketed drug products in support of multiple agency programs and activities, expressly including use of such data to prepare reports, lists, or other information identifying marketed drug products to respond to inquiries from, or that may otherwise be shared with other governmental entities or the public.

Requirements: 

1. The Contractor and product must support the following:
a.   On-line searchable, sortable prescription drug product file.
b.   Ten or more years plus in compiling drug product related data for those drug products in the commercial marketplace.
c.   Ability to obtain new drug product listings and discontinue drug product listings that are no longer on the marketplace on a timely basis using a monitored process. 
d.   Adds all newly approved FDA products.
e.   Coded method of identifying which drugs are FDA approved (NDAs and ANDAs), pre-1962, etc. and which are not.
f.   Comprehensive, complete, and accurately identified compiling of prescription drug products on the commercial marketplace, referenced by NDC# and manufacturer, distributer, re-labeler or re-packager name and address plus other value added descriptors.
g.   Combines a comprehensive set of drug data base elements, drug pricing and clinical information with multiple types of unique drug identifiers to provide flexibility in representing drug products, enhancing drug product identity and tracking drug related information.

i.   Must include all variations of a drug products packaging (package codes) and updates all on-line files with 30 days of FDA approval.
j.   Reliable data regarding manufacturers, distributors, relabelers, and repackagers and their contact information so that DRLS has an accurate, up to date list of the industry involved in all facets of the drug product supply chain.
k.   Provides means to determine new drug products which have been added since the previous update.
l.   Includes an Over-the-Counter Drug List option.
m.   Identification of both FDA approved and unapproved prescription drug products.  On June 19, 2006, the FDA Commissioner appointed an Unapproved Drug Coordinator to help firms identify the steps they must take to obtain approval of their marketed unapproved drugs.

These studies will enable the Navy to evaluate the capabilities of OSL in the operational environment experienced in naval operations.  In addition to the OSL technology the studies will evaluate the on-site OSL analysis system known as InLight.  NDC and the RTG will determine if the Navy's dosimetry program and laboratories wou! ld benefit from the OSL advantage by using the InLight System.  The InLight system offers different readers and several dosimeter configurations which will be analyzed extensively.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Landauer, Inc. is currently the only commercial manufacture of OSL dosimeters and associated readers.  To date there are no manufactures that can read OSL dosimeters from Landauer, Inc.

Delivery of the software only would require the development of installation instructions and the HAIL software operation would not be guaranteed by L-3 Communications as it has not been validated for use on a different third party computer. FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items applies. Evaluation will be in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items. Evaluation factors are technical capability, price and past performance. Each is equally important.  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items and 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, and DFARS 52.212-7001, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial It! ems apply. The following addenda or additional terms and conditions apply: none. Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating of DO-C9 applies. The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  For information on this acquisition please contact Irma S. Mattei at 401-832-8479 or e-mail at irma.s.mattei@navy.mil.

<a href="mailto:FISHER.TRINA@EPAMAIL.EPA.GOV">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541711   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Transportation & Air Quality (OTAQ), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Purdue University toprovide an analysis of the international land use impacts associated with an increase in biofuel demand using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model. The analysis will simulate land use change and other international trade impacts that occur as a result of changes in biofuel market demand. It will also analyze the impact of several key assumptions associated with land use impacts, including the potential differences in historical and future global responses, the impact of expansion onto marginal lands, and the potential to intensify production on existing land. Purdue will also help to compare the results from the GTAP model with other agricultural sector models. Deliverables for this project include intermediate and final model results for the different scenarios analyzed.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. The GTAP model is the only computable general equilibrium model of its kind that provides detailed global economic and trade data on a multiregion, multisector scale. EPA and others have utilized the GTAP model for analysis of land use change impacts associated with different biofuels and this is a key model that will be used in the ongoing analysis by EPA. The lead researcher for this effort is located at Purdue University, and is uniquely qualified to complete this work for EPA. He has developed extensive expertise in economy-wide analysis of trade and environmental policies, including analysis of biofuel policies and mandates. He is Executive Director and founder of the Global Trade Analysis Project. Furthermore, he has experience examining, and in an author on, papers discussing the specific factors and parameters impacting land use change that EPA is interested in. The lead researcher has been working for over ten years to develop the GTAP model and database and is recognized as an expert in the field. For these reasons, the Purdue team is exceptionally qualified to undertake these tasks. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this announcement must be made electronically via email to the Contract Specialist, Trina Fisher, at fisher.trina@epa.gov. To telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:robin.turner@us.army.mil">US Army C-E LCMC Acquisition Center - DAAB07</a>
<DESC>This announcement constitutes an official Request For Information (RFI).  This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendation to select the best alternative for a supply-chain management service Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract in support of the NVGs AN-PVS-7B-D, AN-PVS-14, and AN-AVS-6.  A future solicitation-contract would provide PBL driven support and management services for CECOM managed NVG spare parts located worldwide.  This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP), or an Invitation For Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  An Industry Day will be announced at a later date for those interested parties seeking additional information.  Questions from concerned parties to be answered during Industry Day, must be submitted no later than 20 calendar days after release of this RFI.<BR>BACKGROUND:   The AN-PVS-7B-D is a single-tube night vision goggle, that uses a Generation III image intensifier (MX-10130D), and prisms and lenses to provide the user with simulated binocular vision.  It is used in starlight and moonlight by personnel for walking, driving vehicles, weapon firing, short-range surveillance, and such manual tasks as map reading, vehicle maintenance, and administering medical aid.  The AN-PVS-7B-D can be affixed either to a head mount that is held by head straps to the users head or to a helmet mount which attaches to the helmet.  The assembly incorporates an IR-emitting light source that provides illumination when required, for close-up viewing.  Eyepiece diopter adjustment is provided so the device can be worn without corrective eyeglasses.<BR>The AN-PVS-14 is a single-tube monocular night vision device, that uses a Generation III image intensifier (MX-11769).   It is a lightweight, self-contained, image intensification system capable of being either hand-held, mounted to a small arms weapons mounting rail, or mounted to a head mount or helmet mount.  The AN-PVS-14 is intended to be used in starlight and moonlight by personnel for walking, driving vehicles, weapon firing, short-range surveillance, and such manual tasks as map reading, vehicle maintenance, and administering medical aid.  It employs a variable gain that can be adjusted by the user.  The assembly incorporates an IR-emitting light source that provides illumination when required, for close-up viewing.  Eyepiece diopter adjustment is provided so the device can be worn without corrective eyeglasses.<BR><BR><BR>The AN-AVS-6, Aviation Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) is a lightweight, high performance passive Generation III image intensifier (MX-10160A-C) system designed specifically for use by helicopter pilots during night flights.  The AN-AVS-6 consists of a helmet mount, a binocular imaging assembly, a low-profile battery pack, a carrying case, and ancillary equipment.  <BR>Currently, the supply-chain management of 33 CECOM managed spare parts will be included in this RFI (NSNs and part numbers will be provided upon request).  Technical Manuals are also available for each of the NVG systems.  This RFI is intended to provide a forum to identify opportunities to improve the acquisition lead time of NVG spare parts; increase sustainment readiness; and decrease sustainment costs without changing the current in-place maintenance structure.  Management of suppliers within the supply chain and spare parts (including requirements determination, forecasting, stock, store, issue and transportation) will be addressed.  Disclaimer: This Market Research and RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a RFP or IFB; an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services; or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization.  This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited.  This information is subject to change and in no way binds this office to pursue any course of action described herein.  If this office chooses to issue a RFP at some future date, another notice will be published. <BR>OBJECTIVE: This office is searching for the best PBL alternative to support the NVGs without interrupting the current in place logistic supply system.  This office will utilize a supply-chain management service PBL contract to enhance support of the NVGs based on the recommended PBL alternative.  The overarching objective is to reduce the acquisition lead time and cost while improving current systems readiness and reliability for both peace and war time arenas.  The government contemplates issuing a solicitation under FAR Part 15, that may result in a Firm Fixed Price type contract lasting five years with additional five one- year options.  Estimated award date is 2QFY10.  This office will seek a single supply-chain manager due to the complexity of the required technical support to the customer.  Partnerships are acceptable and encouraged as long as a single point of accountability for supply-chain management is identified.  If the proposed PBL initiative utilizes or partners with organic entities such as Army Depots or the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) as a source of supply, then an explanation is required on how these organizations will be used.  All items included in this RFI are CECOM managed items.  However, the family of the NV goggles uses DLA managed items.  The proposed PBL initiative may consider the use of FAR 51.000 for the use of DLA as a source of supply, but is not required.<BR>RESPONSES: Response will be a 3 step process.  The first step is to inform the Government in writing (see SUBMISSION INFORMATION below), within 20 calendar days after the RFI release date, of interest in this PBL effort and submission of written questions to be answered at Industry day.  The second step will be participation in a question and answer session at the Industry Day, whose date and place will be released to interested vendors.

The information will NOT be used to establish a pre-qualification list.  The purpose of this market survey is to determine if a set-aside under one of the small business programs is appropriate.  The Government anticipates issuance of a pre-solicitation notice for this project on or about 23 January 2009.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR virginia.slayton@us.army.mil  65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR><BR>     The Southeast Region (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in the countries of Honduras and Cuba, and the territory of Puerto Rico announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of NON-SKID SLIPPERS.     <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company MUST have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements (RIAs) that supplement the Prime Vendor Program.  The RFQ will not result in a contract award.   For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is July 2009.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  Point of Contact:  VIRGINIA SLAYTON, (706) 787-2019, VIRGINIA.SLAYTON@US.ARMY.MIL.    <BR><BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of NON-SKID SLIPPERS, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $32,468.96.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>B.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.  Submissions must be received by COB 5:00 PM EDT on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EDT on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>C.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendors, on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.<BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to VIRGINIA.SLAYTON@US.ARMY.MIL. by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  <BR>In general, acceptability for the purposes of validation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and /or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products and services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  NOTE:  Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Non-Skid Slippers products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  <BR>a.	At a minimum the vendor must provide the following: Non-Skid Slippers that are latex free/safe, available in all sizes (Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large) in the following types 1) Sock-Type  color coded for fall-prevention, single and/or double tread, (traction soles), and washable; 2) Foam Slippers  lightweight, disposable, stretchable slippers with skid-resistant soles<BR>b.	Vendor MUST provide a complete itemized list of items supplied (manufactured and/or distributed by brands) via excel sheet, and product catalog & literature in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and device type.  (Vendors who do not have a complete product line as above will be disqualified in Phase I).<BR>2.	Vendor MUST have a DAPA for the Non-Skid Slippers product line.  Vendor MUST provide the DAPA number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors without a DAPA number will be disqualified in Phase I).  <BR>3.	Vendor MUST have a separate agreement with the prime vendor in the Southeast Region for Non-Skid Slippers (currently, the prime vendor is Owens & Minor).  Vendor MUST provide prime vendor conversion number with initial submittal.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the Southeast Region PV (Owens & Minor) will be disqualified in Phase I.)  <BR>4.	Vendors MUST submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for ALL products in Phase II will be disqualified.<BR>5.	Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for Non-Skid Slippers products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this question.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.<BR>6.	Vendor MUST provide Latex Free/Safe slippers.  Vendor MUST identify all Latex Free/Safe Slippers in response to this RFQ with initial submittal.  <BR><BR>Phase II Plan  Clinical/Performance Evaluations and Pricing Analysis Process:<BR>Clinical/Performance Evaluations<BR>1.	Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent directly to the TRBO point of contact and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Product samples must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO location by COB, 5:00 PM EDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Note: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment from the vendor and final delivery date of the product sample sets.  The TRBO point of contact is responsible for delivery of the sample sets to the participating MTFs prior to the evaluation and within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the sample sets at the designated address.  <BR>2.	Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable, and five (5)-highly acceptable.<BR>3.	All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for one (1) calendar day.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process (DSCP approval).<BR>4.	To determine acceptability, the CPT, comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines from the Southeast Region will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting. <BR>5.	Vendor will provide no cost product samples for clinical/performance evaluation.  Vendors will ONLY provide sample products of the items that are requested and being evaluated.  (Unused samples will not be returned).  Vendors WILL NOT be required for in-servicing prior to or during the evaluations.  Vendors WILL NOT be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products OR THEIR COMPETITORS PRODUCTS.  <BR>6.	Each criterion for Non-Skid Slippers will be evaluated by two (2) trials, on each vendors sample, in a non-clinical/non-patient care setting.<BR> <BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>SOCK Type ONLY<BR>1.	(National Patient Safety Goal NPSG.09.02.01 - specifically Reduce the risk of patient harm resulting from falls by placing emphasis on wearing Non-Skid Slippers) - The slipper socks non-skid material on the tread surface maintains integrity and grips the walking surface without slipping or sliding under the foot. <BR>a.	Non-skid material on the slipper tread surface must be of sufficient amount and positioning to assure tread grips the walking surface with each step without slipping or sliding which may increase the risk of falling.  <BR>b.	With the Non-Skid Sock Slippers on the evaluators feet, the evaluator will observe the gripping quality and effectiveness of the non-skid tread material, and observe for any cracking, peeling, or chipping of non-skid tread material leading to compromise of griping quality and effectiveness. <BR>2.	(National Patient Safety Goal NPSG.09.02.01 - specifically Reduce the risk of patient harm resulting from falls by placing emphasis on wearing Non-Skid Slippers)  The Slipper Sock material holds to the foot/ankle without drooping and sagging while walking. <BR>a.	Slipper material that droops/sags with movement such as walking may result in an increased risk for a patient fall or non-compliance in wearing the Safety slippers.  <BR>b.	The evaluator will ensure the appropriate sized Sock type slipper is utilized and then observe for any drooping/sagging of slipper material during wear.  <BR>3.	(National Patient Safety Goal NPSG.07.02.01  specifically Reduce the risk of health care-associated infections resulting from pressure ulcers by placing emphasis on wearing Non-Skid Slippers that properly fit the feet)  Slipper Sock material holds to the foot or ankle without impairing circulation.   <BR>a.	Slipper Sock material that holds to the foot or ankle too tightly may impair circulation to the tissue leading to discomfort or further injury to the tissue and/or non-compliance in wearing of the Non-Skid Slippers.  <BR>b.	The evaluator will ensure the appropriate sized Sock type slipper is utilized and then observe for any changes in skin color/temperature of foot/ankle tissue and any pressure marks on the skin of the foot/ankle made by the slipper sock.<BR><BR>FOAM Type ONLY<BR>4.	(National Patient Safety Goal NPSG.09.02.01 - specifically Reduce the risk of patient harm resulting from falls by placing emphasis on wearing Non-Skid Slippers) - The non-skid material on the tread surface of the foam slippers maintains its integrity and grips the walking surface without slipping, sliding or tearing. <BR>c.	Non-skid material on the Foam slipper tread surface must be of sufficient amount and positioning to assure tread grips the walking surface with each step without slipping, sliding or tearing, which may increase the risk of falling.  <BR>d.	The evaluator observes the gripping quality and effectiveness of the non-skid tread material, and observes for any cracking, peeling, or chipping of non-skid tread material leading to compromise of griping quality and effectiveness.  <BR>5.	(National Patient Safety Goal NPSG.07.02.01  specifically Reduce the risk of health care-associated infections resulting from pressure ulcers by placing emphasis on wearing Non-Skid Slippers that properly fit the feet  Foam Slipper interior seams and surfaces are smooth when worn and do not cause pressure or irritation to the tissues of the foot/ankle during wear.  <BR>a.	Foam Slipper material that is rough on the interior seams/surfaces can cause pressure, impair circulation, and/or can cause discomfort which inhibit or deter patient walking.  The patient may also not wear foam slippers if they provide discomfort, thus increasing their potential for falls and injury.<BR>b.	The evaluator will ensure the appropriate sized Foam type slipper is utilized and then observe for any changes in skin color/temperature of foot/ankle tissue and any pressure marks on the skin of the foot/ankle made by the Foam slipper.<BR>      <BR>Pricing Analysis Process.  Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who are found technical acceptable will be qualified/invited to provide their product samples and price discount quotes concurrently.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Southeast Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by COB 5:00 PM (EDT), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.  However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.<BR>	<BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Southeast Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Southeast Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing. This is the most important pricing element.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the Southeast Region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (3) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Southeast Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of Clinically Acceptable, clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 15 APRIL 2009 5:00 PM EDT.<BR> <BR>

<SOLNBR>F2VUE0-09-RFI-IBS-SWCS
<RESPDATE>050809
<CONTACT>Roxanne A. Gerry, Contracting Officer, Phone 813-826-5177, Fax 813-826-7504, Email gerryr@socom.mil - Penny R. Petee, Contractor Contract Specialist, Phone 8138262491, Email penny.petee.ctr@socom.mil
<DESC><p>USSOCOM is requesting information from appropriate companies or parties currently capable of developing an Integrated Bridge System (IBS), as a prime system integrator for a host- launched, Shallow Water Combat Submersible (SWCS) vehicle that will provide Special Operation Forces (SOF) shallow water undersea operations similar to those currently performed on the MK 8 MOD 1 SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV). The IBS must address a wide range of operational challenges including the growing ability of hostile nations to detect, identify and target SOF conducting undersea tasks. Broad industry participation is desired but USSOCOM is keenly interested in designs that are currently in production or capable of rapidly entering into production. Delivery of a capability within 12 months would be required and within less than six months is highly desirable. To complete the study and consider programming initiatives in the fiscal year 2010 Program Objective Memorandum (POM), USSOCOM requires current industry sources and capabilities information.
<p>1. PURPOSE: This notice is part of Government Market Research, a process for obtaining the latest information on the &lsquo;art of the possible' from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. All company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked. Any proprietary information contained in response to this request will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure. The government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this Request for Information (RFI) are to identify responsible sources and interested parties who have proven solutions that can meet or exceed IBS requirements. For the purpose of this RFI, the term "proven" means solutions at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) "6" or higher, preferably TRL "7" or higher that have been validated in their relevant or operational environment. Examples would be testing in a high fidelity laboratory which emulates the undersea environment or actual system prototype testing in a surface or subsurface environment.</p>
<p>3. BACKGROUND: The MK 8 MOD 1 SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) is approaching the end of its service life. The system was originally designed around a standard 1553 data bus, making upgrades and replacements no longer cost effective due to obsolescence. In some cases, increased capability may be available but the lack of an open architecture prevents cost effective upgrade of the systems. The SWCS will require development of an IBS with an open architecture, a power and signal distribution system capable of integrating various electronic systems and sensors, and the capability to display operational data to the vehicle pilot and navigator.</p>
<p>4. OPERATIONAL SCENARIOS: The new SWCS will transport SOF personnel and equipment in a wet environment into littoral waters and harbors. The IBS must address a wide range of operational challenges including the growing ability of hostile nations to detect, identify and target SOF conducting undersea tasks. Thus, the SWCS shall have a modular subsystem design conducive to accommodating upgrades to processors and sensors. Operating in a free-flooding "wet" vehicle, the SWCS passengers and crew transit for extended durations (i.e. up to 12 hours) in a wet, variant temperature environment while breathing from SCUBA gear. Thus hardware and software selected must feature interfaces that are mission-centric to ensure required operator actions are simple and minimized.</p>
<p>5. REQUIREMENTS: Following general, unclassified system requirements are applicable:</p>
<p>A) NET-Ready: <br />Objective: 100% of interfaces, services, policy-enforcement controls, and data correctness, availability and processing requirements in the Joint integrated architecture. <br />Threshold: 100% of interfaces, services, policy-enforcement controls, and data correctness, availability and processing requirements designated as enterprise-level or critical in the Joint integrated architecture. <br />B) Force Protection/Survivability:<br />Objective: SWCS shall have the ability to detect threats commensurate with the threat environment using passive sensors, i.e. passive sonar, and ESM. Threshold: SWCS shall have the ability to detect threats consistent with the Mark VIII Mod 1 SDV technologies. <br />C) Navigation Accuracy: *<br />Objective: The navigation system will allow safe and accurate navigation, to include an integrated precision navigation system such as an Inertial Navigation System (INS) augmented by Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) Compliant GPS.<br />Threshold: The navigation system will allow safe and accurate navigation, to include an integrated precision navigation system such as a Doppler navigation system augmented by Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) Compliant GPS. <br />D) Diver-to-Diver, Diver-to-SWCS, and SWCS-to-Host Communications: <br />Objective: Secure LPI/LPD Wireless underwater communications systems linking Diver-to-Diver, Diver-to SWCS, and SWCS-to-Host. <br />Threshold: Secure LPI/LPD Tethered underwater communications systems linking Diver-to-Diver, Diver-to SWCS, and SWCS-to-Host. <br />E) Communications While Docked:<br />Objective: SWCS and subsystems will utilize secure wireless connection to host for data exchange. SWCS shall be capable of wireless digital networking from within DDS to host using COTS standard equipment.<br />Threshold: SWCS and subsystems will utilize umbilical cable connection to host platform for data exchange. <br />F) Performance &amp; Mission Availability: <br />Objective: 15 twelve-hour missions without a critical failure with 0.95 reliability over 15 days of use in a 30 day period.<br />Threshold: 10 twelve-hour missions without a critical failure with 0.90 reliability over 10 days of use in a 30 day period.<br />G) Sensor Mast: <br />Objective: SWCS will include a sensor mast with an open-architecture, allowing the plug-n-Play integration of various imaging sensors. <br />H) Docking System: *<br />Objective: Rendezvous system shall support automated docking to Host<br />Threshold: Rendezvous system shall support manual docking to Host <br />I) Maximum Diver Deployment Depth: <br />Objective: Equipment and life support systems will operate as deep as 300 ft seawater, limited by established safety practices exercised from using the U.S. Dive Manual for Open and Closed Circuit Mixed Gas Diving. <br />Threshold: Equipment and life support systems will operate as deep as 190 ft seawater, limited by established safety practices exercised from using the U.S. Dive Manual for Open and Closed Circuit Mixed Gas Diving.</p>
<p>* Note: Access to classified information is not required to respond to this RFI; however, in the event a RFP is issued in the future, competitors must have a facility clearance as well as personal clearance(s) up to SECRET.</p>
<p>7. INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDENTS: Interested parties should provide capabilities, qualification statements, and examples that demonstrate their ability to satisfy the requirements detailed in paragraph 5 of this announcement.

The calibration and set-up data is held as proprietary by Wartsila North America.  The USCG Engineering Logistics Center does not possess the manufacturing engineering drawings, test procedures, test specification or calibration set up data.  The Government intends to solicit only Wartsila North America and/or their authorized repair facilities.  It is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard from obtaining competition, as the Woodward engineering drawings, are available from one source only.  However other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to obtain technical data, manufacturing engineering drawings, test procedures and test specifications along with the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The procurement involves spare parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacture or its actual supplier, and others proposing to manufacture the parts must either: 1) Data the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufacturer; or 2) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e. salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics).  The submission of technical data package for review shall not impede the award of this requirements type contract, but will qualify the proposer for follow on acquisitions of the specific part numbers offered.  It is the Government belief that only Woodward Governor, the manufacture of the parts, or/or its dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure proper fit, form and function of all its components.  It is also the belief of the Government that only Wartsila North America holds the proprietary calibration and set-up data.  The U.S. Coast Guard does not possess the technical expertise to evaluate the overhaul capabilities of alternate of equal products.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities in duplicate within 15 days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing data is required.  This is not a request for quote.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  Responses must be concise and specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above.  Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capability should be sent to the attention of Yvette R. Johnson, USCG ELC 2401 Hawkins Point Road, Baltimore, MD  21226 Attn: M/S 26.  It is intended to award a Requirements Type Contract with one (1) Base Year and Four (04) option years.  Delivery shall be made to U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center, 2401 Hawkins Point Road, Baltimore, MD  21226-5000.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered.

<DESC>As allowed under FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, additional work will be placed with Geo Systems Analysis Inc that extends the performance period under their current Contract 06CR308057- Feasibility Study Using Native Seeds in Restoration from a 3 year performance period to 4 years.  This award was made after competitive quotes were solicited from the GSA Multiple Award Schedule as authorized by FAR 8.401   Geo Systems Analysis was awarded a 3 year Research and Development contract on March 24 2006, to conduct a study on best methods and protocol to use when collecting, storing, germinating and growing native seeds in the Lower Colorado Region to control weed infestation by salt cedar and other shade intolerant non natives.   An additional year of research is required at this time to continue monitoring the 54 established small scale test plots through the 2009 growing season.  This follow on effort is required to evaluate the survival, growth rates and competition between riparian trees and salt cedar and to determine the effects of different irrigation regimes on growth rates and competition.In addition to extending the original performance requirements from 3 years to 4 years, Geo Systems Analysis will also monitor and analyze vegetation dynamics (survival & growth) during the 4th year as well as manage and coordinate the irrigation regimes.  Additional work to be performed will include site preparation for more small scale test plots that will include irrigation, herbicide and tillage cycles to reduce weeds and grasses.  The study plots will also be furrowed prior to seeding.   Geo Systems Analysis will have a subcontractor do the seeding and oversee the effort.   Geo Systems is uniquely qualified to perform on this effort as they performed the first 3 years of research.  Use of any other offeror would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through competition.    
The estimated dollar value for monitoring the 4th year and for all additional vegetation efforts and for managing the irrigation during the 2009 growing season is estimated to be approximately $123,742.00.    Additional information on this effort may be obtained from Liz Bailey at eebailey@usbr.gov.

<SUBJECT>Proposed addition of Super Sticky Phone Message Pad to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<SOLNBR>CP-03-24
<RESPDATE>040709
<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC><p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Super Sticky Phone Message Pad by the Federal Government.</p>
<p>The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.</p>
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>7530-01-425-4088, The self-stick phone message pad consists of 50 sheets of 4x5 assorted neon (green, pink and blue) printed paper which reads Important Message at the top with adhesive on the top of the back of each sheet</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA, New York, NY.</p>
<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Super Sticky Phone Message Pad to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>MMM 76794</p>
<p>MMM 7662</p>
<p>SPR 19809</p>
<p>SNTEL4N</p>
<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Super Sticky Phone Message Pad to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than April 7, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data. General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>This announcement serves to publish the government's intent to procure professional services with only one source contingent upon funds availability to Remote Reality Corporation, under FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotes.   A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon potential responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Remote Reality Corporation has been identified by the government due to their technical capability to provide the following services:
The U.S. Army Weapons and Software Engineering Center (WSEC) has a need for a contractor with expert knowledge of the design, manufacture and testing of 360 degree cameras, short-wave infrared (SWIR) cameras, and sensor networking.  Efforts shall include support for fundamental research into catadioptric 360 degree optical augmentation, a feasibility study into the design and production of such a system, support for initial design work on such a system, and coordination for a proposal for the prototyping of said system. In order for a company to meet the specialized requirements of the SAURON Project, the contractor must possess rights on a 360 degree camera which meets the following two specific technical requirements:  first the system is required to be a single camera catadioptric system, and second the system must have refined post-processing of the image already in place (to include "flattening" the image, pixel mapping, and motion tracking capability). These specialized requirements apply due to the unique constraints placed on the camera, as required for the success of the SAURON effort.
Please submit responses by email NLT: COB, 04/08/2009 to Mary Watkins at  mary_e_watkins@nbc.gov.

<DESC>As prescribed in FAR 15.209(c), the following provision is inserted: IAW FAR 52.215-3.  Request for Information (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI), or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" may be used in this RFI, your response will be as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This RFI is issued for the purpose of assisting in acquisition planning, identifying industry interest, and  gaining information from industry on investments needed to upgrade and sustain the AV-8B aircraft Air Data Computer (ADC) (P/N: 2117642-6-1) and 2 Flight Control Computers (P/N: 4041789-958 and P/N: 4041789-955). Note: P/N 4041789-958 is often referred to as a "Navigation Computer" by mistake in various documentation and databases, but it is actually the same Flight Control Computer and shares many of the same common CCAs.  d)  This announcement is for market research and does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP).  This is not a Research and Development (R&D) request.  e) PMA-257 is seeking information on affordable upgrades to selected Circuit Card Assemblies and individual electronic components using the latest Commercial Off  The Shelf (COTS) technology to  sustain the AV-8B aircraft until 2024. Vendors may provide information on any one system or both systems but are requested to itemize the information for each system. An information package containing parts breakdown, repair manuals, and excel worksheets (to assist in providing information to this request) will be made available electronically upon request.

The following assumptions apply to RFI submittals regarding both of these systems: 
1)  Affordability is critical aspect of upgrading the CCA and piece parts. 
2)  The Government does not desire a new "box" as a solution, but only to upgrade where necessary and buy life time parts to sustain the systems until 2024. The Government intends to only replace select boards and electronic components based on obsolescence triggers that will not allow it to sustain the CCAs or electronic components until the year 2024. The desire is to reuse the chassis, front interconnect assembly, and backplane (if possible). The vendor is to recommend which CCAs and electronic components are to be replaced.
3)  Assume a Form, Fit, Functional replacement approach
4)  The existing software executable code will be used  existing software logic applies   
5)  The Government will serve as the DEPOT level repair of all CCAs.
6)  Assumes a contract award/start date of March 1st 2012 and a duration of 30 months (or less) for the development of this effort. Assume a production award for CCAs and individual components in the 1st quarter of  FY15 (Oct to Dec of calendar year 2014). 
7)  It is desirable to hold CDR within 15 months from contract award.   
8)  Installation concept shall not require modification to existing aircraft hardware and software architecture.  
9)  No changes shall be required in the existing aircraft interface (same pin-outs without wiring for internal test points and same external dimensions)
10)  The unit shall interface with existing 28V DC aircraft power. 
11)  No flex assemblies or jumpers shall be required.   

Informational Responses should include the following:

1)  Provide an itemized ROM for each unit you respond to. Separate Non-recurring (NRE) from Recurring cost by system, and by year. Include a schedule delineating overall plan and major events (including technical reviews, such as, SRR, PDR, CDR, etc). Use the Government developed excel working sheet to itemize by part number and CCA.  If an interested party, please request this excel working sheet from the Government points of contact identified below.  
2)  For each CCA, please indicate whether the CCA should be upgraded with a new board and components, whether select components should be re-engineered, or whether a life time buy of individual electronics components (active and passive) is warranted. (Lowest cost approach applies). It desirable to have the estimated NRE upgrade cost per individual card for all CCAs regardless of the vendors approach. Provides itemized ROM (NRE and recurring)
3)  Provide estimate for 8 test units (full systems) to be developed by the vendor for qualification (eg; vibration, E3, etc) and flight tests.  The vendor will be responsible for qualification testing and supporting government system integration and flight testing. Also assume that these 8 units will have "new" chassis, and a combination of new and reused cards. Itemize cost for each test unit.
4)  Provide estimate to update all affected drawings, prepare interface control documents, and detailed vendor specifications for each CCA.

New Procurement

Interested parties qualified of providing an AV-8B aircraft Air Data Computer (ADC) and/or Navigation Computer's CCA / electronic component replacement parts which are Form, Fit, and Functional as part of this market survey, which meet or exceed the above requirements, shall also provide a Statement of Capability (SOC). This describes the vendor's existing proficiency to supply, modify, and sustain the system to aircraft out of service date.  

The SOC shall be unclassified and the information submitted should be pertinent to, and identify system capability as related to the technical effort requested above.  There is no page limit imposed for the responses.  Responses should be received by close of business 30 days after release of RFI. 
 
Please direct all questions to Greg Makrakis at Greg.Makrakis@navy.mil or Michael A. Cocca Michael.Cocca@navy.mil for technical questions and Leslie Stork at leslie.stork@navy.mil for contracts questions.  Again, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to directly pay for any information or any responses submitted as the result of this RFI.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The intent of this notice is for information purposes only.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Chicago Operations Branch intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source firm fixed-price contract, 1 base year and 4 option years with McGraw Hill Construction Dodge 1200 G. Street. N.W., Suite 900, Washington, DC 20005. The procurement is for Real Estate Pipeline Data System and Reports, a database provides HUD's field economists with information on Multifamily and commercial properties under construction, in planning, and recently completed. The database provides detailed information on the number of units, costs, expected completion dates, developers, and use. The online feature of the database allows our field economists to search for projects at a variety of geographic levels including a certain mile radius around a particular project. These data are invaluable for completing Comprehensive Housing Market Analysis Reports, spotlight articles on individuals housing markets for the U.S. Housing Market Conditions reports, and project reviews for projects that have applied for FHA mortgage insurance. This is a unique database which is not done by anyone else to the government knowledge.

Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements), HUD intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, however, the Government will consider all proposals received within 14 days after due date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure brand name Rittal server racks to support existing Rittal hardware infrastructure that is installed in its data center facilities.  This announcement is considered a brand name justification.  This is not a solicitation.  This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). This acquisition will be conducted utilizing existing USPTOs Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quanity (ID/IQ) contracts for Information Technology products, a small business set-aside.  Rittal server rack hardware is the USPTOs established standard based commercial product in accordance with the USPTOs Technical Reference Model (TRM), which defines a comprehensive set of information technology standards, services, interfaces, supporting data formats, and protocols.  It is essential that the USPTO acquire Rittal server racks for consistency and flexibility.  Currently, the USPTO has 170 installed Rittal server racks.  The Rittal racks are much more versatile because they will handle all manufacturer servers, including Dell, IBM, HP and SUN (x386 (Intel) as well as HP UNIX).  By using the Rittal racks, we are able to support all manufacturers and move servers within the data center as necessary to support operations without having to purchase manufacturer specific racks.  Rittal is the manufacturer for Dell, HP and some of the IBM racks but because these racks are built for a specific manufacturer, they are a higher cost.  Since Rittal is the supplier for the other server manufacturers as well as those mentioned above, we are actually able to purchase a better rack at a lower cost then buying manufacturer specific racks.  The need is to continue their use for continuity and for efficient use of replacement parts and spare parts.  These racks are for Data Center Stabilization Project.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), Program Executive Office(PEO) C4I, Navy Multiband Terminal (NMT) Program Office (PMW/A-170) intends tonegotiate, on a sole source basis, a Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) contractmodification under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1 withRaytheon Company, Network Centric Systems, 1001Boston Post Road, Marlborough,MA 01752.
This contract modification will require Raytheon Company to modify the NMT tofulfill the Air Force requirement for a GTC.  The EPS GTC modification to theNMT will allow the XDR EHF communications payloads operating on HEO, to providecontinuous protected communication to U.S. forces in extreme northernlatitudes.  Additionally, these satellites will be interoperable with terminalsdesigned for the Navy Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) and backwardcompatible Transformational Satellite (TSAT)Communication systems currently under development.  Raytheon Company is thebest technically qualified entity capable of providing the additionalrequirements for the EPS GTC interface to the existing NMT baseline withinschedule constraints and the program's cost.  Engaging a different contractorto modify Raytheon's NMT design to accommodate EPS communication requirements,will negatively affect any significant logistics and life cycle sustainmentsavings the Navy expects to realize. Furthermore, a majority of the designchanges are extremely complex, software intensive, and require a level ofknowledge only currently understood by Raytheon Company.  In order to gaineconomies of scale in the development, production, and sustainment phases ofthe EPS modifications it is required that Raytheon be the Prime Contractor forthe effort.  In addition, the contractor will provide Contract DataRequirements List (CDRLs) andtechnical/logistics data to support installation and integration.
The Government is not soliciting proposals in response to this synopsis. Thisnotice is to facilitate potential subcontracting opportunities. However, sinceit is the policy of the Government to foster competition, any prospectiveofferor may provide information, which the Government will consider in itscontinued review of the sole-source nature of the requirement. Questions shouldbe submitted no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this synopsis toKenneth Nickel, Contract Specialist, (619)524-7178, kenneth.nickel@navy.mil.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for thisrequirement is 334290.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, 	5000 W National Avenue Bldg 5, Milwaukee WI  532952.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Justification and approval for other than full and open competition for certified Medical Supply Technicians required at Hines VA for 1st and 2nd shifts.  Procurement will proceed on a sole source basis with Med Staff Alternatives.3.	A description of supplies/services required (including the estimated value):  Hines VA has a requirement for certified Medical Supply Technicians in order to run a 24/7 operation in sterile processing.  Currently Hines is attempting to recruit for these positions; however, a critical need exists now to ensure patient care is not jeopardized and in order to comply with VA Handbook 7176, Supply Processing and Distribution Operational Requirements, which mandates the use of certified Medical Supply Technicians.  Severe penalties will be imposed on any VA hospital that does not follow this mandate.  Require five 1st shift personnel and three 2nd shift personnel for a base period of three months.   Estimated three month value is approximately $115,000.4.	Statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The VAs minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source.  (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1)).5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  Hines VA does not currently have the in-house resources to run a continuous 24/7 operation in sterile processing using certified Medical Supply Technicians.  This is critical to patient care and to be in compliance with VA Handbook 7176, which mandates the use of certified Medical Supply Technicians.6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  Small business searches in CCR and VetBiz were conducted with no matches found.  The labor category of certified Medical Supply Technician was not found in the GSA eLibrary under the FSS.  7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Similar services have been obtained by the Jesse Brown VAMC from 4/1/08  10/31/08.  Current rates will be compared to the past PO with an increase in the cost of living allowance added, if deemed appropriate, as well as shift differential pricing.8.	Market survey conducted:  A Dynamic Small Business Search on the CCR website resulted in no profiles that met the search criteria of medical supply technician.  Similar searches in VetBiz and the GSA eLibrary also produced no matches.  The medical staff at Hines VA also conducted market research of temporary staffing agencies in the Chicago area and found no agencies that could provide certified medical supply technicians.9.	Other facts:   Compliance with VA Handbook 7176.10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  Active recruiting practices are on-going at Hines VA to permanently hire adequate staffing needs for this position.  If recruitment is unsuccessful during the performance of this requirement, a sources sought should be posted to the FBO website with adequate lead-time to potentially solicit more competition for future needs.12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.DEBRA HURONContracting Officer

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements. <br />Factor 5 - Enhanced 911 Service. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911. <br />Factor 6 - Diversity. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound pictorial approach for diversity to include the methodology for accomplishing diversity.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>(1) Technical Capability: Personnel Professional Qualifications - Assigned personnel experience within a federal agency environment to include the following: Knowledge of Federal Travel Regulations, Knowledge of Fly America Act , GSA City-Pairs Program and Knowledge of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Secure flight Program Reporting Procedures.</p>
<p><br />The Government will use the following adjectival rating:</p>
<p><br />Exceptional Offeror's proposal exceeds requirements and demonstrates an exceptional understanding of goals and objectives of the acquisition. One or more major strengths exist. No significant weaknesses or deficiencies exist.<br />Acceptable Offeror's proposal demonstrates an acceptable understanding of goals and objectives of the acquisition. There may be strengths and weaknesses. Strengths outbalance any weaknesses that exist and there are no deficiencies.<br />Marginal Offeror's proposal demonstrates a marginal understanding of the goals and objectives of the acquisition. Weaknesses have been found that outbalance any strengths that exist. Weaknesses will be difficult to correct. Deficiencies must be corrected prior to award.<br />Unacceptable Offeror's proposal demonstrates an unacceptable understanding of the goals and objectives of the acquisition. The proposal has one or more significant weaknesses or deficiencies that will be very difficult to correct, or are not correctable.</p>
<p>(2) Past Performance: Past performance shall be evaluated with respect to an offeror's probability of successfully completing the solicitation requirements based on the offeror's performance on similar contract efforts.</p>
<p>If the Offeror has no relevant corporate or organizational past performance, the Offeror may provide past performance on an Offeror's proposed key personnel who have relevant experience. An Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, will receive a neutral rating on past performance.</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned that the Government will use data provided by each Offeror and data obtained from other sources in the evaluation of past and present performance.</p>
<p>The Past performance references should be included as a separate section in the Technical proposal and should include the following: contract Number, contract dollar value, period of performance, description of services, and name of agency or company point of contact for contract to include name, telephone number and email address. The Offeror shall provide completed work assignments during the last three years similar in nature, or directly related to the requirements of the statement of work.</p>
<p>Past Performance - Adjectival Ratings: The Government will use the following ratings: High Risk, Medium Risk, Low Risk, and Unknown Risk</p>
<p>High Risk Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.<br />Medium Risk Can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increased cost, or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.<br />Low Risk Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.<br />Unknown Risk No relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction. A search was unable to identify any relevant past performance information for the Offeror or key team members/subcontractors or their key personnel. This is neither a negative or positive assessment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />10. Proposal Submission Requirements: Volume 1. Technical Proposal: One (1) original and 3 additional paper copies, One (1) CD or electronic copy. Volume 2: Price Proposal: One (1) Original and 3 additional paper copies, One (1) CD or electronic copy. This is a best value procurement. Offerors are cautioned that failure to provide all the required information may make the offer non-responsive and may result in elimination of the Offeror from further consideration for award. Also, Offerors are cautioned of the possibility that award may be made without discussion of the proposal received; therefore, the initial offer should be submitted on the most favorable terms from a price and technical standpoint which the Offeror can submit to the Government.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-30.  This solicitation is set-aside for small businesses, NAICS 332312, Fabricated Structural Metal Manufacturing, and NAICS 423810, Cranes (except industrial) merchant wholesalers, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  Note that non-manufacturer small businesses must offer the product of a small business to qualify for the set-aside.  The National Park Service (NPS) encourages the participation of disadvantaged and women-owned businesses.  The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror or offerors whose total offer is the most advantageous for the Government, price and other factors considered.  We reserve the right to cancel this solicitation.
SPECIFICATIONS: 
BACKGROUND: The sectional barge and knuckleboom crane will be used in conjunction with the Stehekin Erosion Control Program on Lake Chelan at the north end of the lake, within the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area. The barge/crane package's main function will be to collect, load and transport building materials, including but not limited to rock, gravel, sand, conventional building materials, tools and supplies, and large woody debris washing out into Lake Chelan from the Stehekin River, using the crane fitted with hydraulic butt grapples to load and unload. The barge will be moored outside and exposed year-round to the elements. The barge will not be self- powered and will require a vessel, not included in this procurement package, to move it from location to location. Offeror shall provide that each section of barge be fitted with an industry-standard rake as barge will be beached along the shoreline at regular intervals during normal usage (see below). This procurement is for a package that includes a sectional barge and a knuckleboom/articulating crane.  The government reserves the right to award these items to different vendors.  Upon request, NPS will provide offerors photographs of similar barge/crane that we own and operate on Ross Lake for reference purposes (send an e-mail to sarah_welch@nps.gov).  Maps and information about the park is at www.nps.gov/noca . REQUIREMENTS:

Evaluation criteria are listed in descending order of importance.    1. Past Performance - Weight = 40 points	
Evaluation will be performed only for existing and prior contracts for work similar in nature and complexity to that required by the solicitation and will include the following:
A. Quality of Products and Services.  Demonstrated ability to perform sign fabrication, engineering, design, installation, and production services in accordance with required design specifications. Conformance to good standards of workmanship and quality control. (0-10)

Special emphasis will be placed on the Project Manager, the techniques employed, and how well the technical and management approaches will ensure the quality, timeliness, and effectiveness of finished products.
3. Samples of Work - Weight = 20
Evaluation will be based on samples of work that demonstrate the ability of proposed personnel and subcontractors to manage and produce graphics and structures that are similar in design and function to signs and sign components to be fabricated as part of this contract.
4. Personnel - Weight = 10
Evaluation will be based on the qualifications, education, knowledge, and work experience of all personnel, including subcontractors, proposed for use under the contract.  Special emphasis will be placed on personnel's training and/or experience in the fabrication of tactile graphics or similar types of fabrication.
Award Criteria:	
The Government anticipates award of one firm-fixed-price contract resulting from this solicitation.  A contract will be made to that responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, cost or price and other factors considered. Technical quality, including past performance, will be considered more important than cost or price. Warranty information as well as life cycle cost considerations will be included in the best value determination.  
In the case of an offeror with respect to which there is no information on past contract performance, or with respect to which information on past contract performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factor of past contract performance. In other words, past performance will be treated as neutral. This will be accomplished by giving a new firm the average score of the other competing offeror's and evaluating the proposal in accordance with the other stated evaluation criteria, (FAR 15.608(2)(iii)).
While price will be a factor in the award decision, the award may not necessarily be made to that offeror submitting the lowest price. Likewise, award will not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work. A thorough examination will be made to determine an offeror's adequate understanding of the Scope of Work related to proposal presentation, price (including materials) and other factors considered. The question to be decided in making the final selection will be whether proposals scoring better are worth the dollar difference (if any).
As proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important. As the technical merit and the evaluated cost or price become essentially equal, other factors may become the determining factor.
The government will consider other factors, as listed below in descending order of importance, secondary to technical, geographical disbursement, and cost or price;
(1) HubZone small business concerns;(2) Small business concerns which are also minority owned and operated; (3) Women-owned firms; and(4) Service-disabled veteran-owned small business firms.
In addition to the evaluation of technical merit, the cost, or price, and other factors, the standards for determining an offeror's responsibility as set forth in FAR 9.104-1, will be examined and considered. Additional factors which are not specifically set forth in this solicitation, but which are prerequisites for award as implied by law, regulation or public policy will be considered in the determination of an offeror's acceptability.
Attachment K, Intention to Propose, should be submitted on or before April 16, 2009.   All proposals should be submitted in an original and four copies for receipt no later than 4:00 p.m., EST, April 23, 2009, and shall be clearly marked with Request for Proposal Number N1105090007.  Offerors are hereby notified that if your proposal is not received by the date and time and at the location specified in this announcement that it will be considered late as stated in FAR Part 52.212.1(f).  
Proposals should be sent to the National Park Service; Harpers Ferry Center; Office of Acquisition Management; Attention: Melody Wolfe, Administrative Specialist; Request for Proposal Number N1105090007; P.O. Box 50; Harpers Ferry, West Virginia 25425-0050.  Proposals by telephone transmitted facsimile (fax) and electronic mail will not be accepted.  
The offeror agrees that the proposal is valid for a period of 90-days after the closing date.

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items. <br />As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows: <br />EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />Evaluation Criteria: Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA): Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />(1) Technical Capability <br />(2) Price<br />Offerors must meet the technical capability criteria by meeting the performance schedule criteria by being able to provide services no later than (NLT) the timeframes specified in the statement of work.<br />The Government will evaluate offerors for each individual item as a "pass" or "fail" based on whether or not the offeror possesses the ability to provide services within the required response times. Offerors lacking the ability to meet required response times will not be considered for award (exception to follow). <br />Those offerors with the capability of providing services within the required response times (s) will be evaluated on their prices. The Government will not apply any type of special consideration to offerors who may be able to respond earlier than the required response timeframes. <br />The government reserves the right to make multiple awards in order to obtain the best overall value for the Government. In the case of all offerors not being able to meet required response times, award may be made to the offeror providing the earliest response time to the timeframe requested. Therefore, if an offeror cannot meet the service response timeframes, the offeror should provide the earliest timeframe in which they can provide service.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision) <br />52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items. <br />As prescribed in 12.301(b)(2), insert the following provision: <br />OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (FEB 2009) <br />An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
      Informal forum with the Ombudsman:. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
      Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). 

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 
Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)
Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 
1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602

<DESC><p>Solicitation&nbsp;extended as follows:&nbsp;03-25-09 at 1200 pm EST</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR QUESTIONS:</p>
<p>
<p>1. First, the newer PCUs seem to be brown, rather than sand. Is this acceptable? I have attached a PDF of exactly what they look like (more coyote brown than anything).</p>
<p>2. Also regarding PCU level 3, you have an additional sage green fleece jacket on the RFQ as well. Do you want two fleece layers, and if not, how shall I discriminate between the two (other than color)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT ANSWERS:</p>
<p>1. Were requesting sand colored PCU wear (light/medium/heavy weight). Fleece is an additional<br />requirement because the heavy weight was not fleece.</p>
<p>Color requirements are dictated by AFI.<br />Fleece - Black/Green Fleece<br />Thermal Undergarments - White/Cream/Sand<br />Sleep Shirt - Green/Brown</p>
<p>Brown is no longer an authorized color except for the sleep shirt. In addition we are requesting two fleece layers.</p>
<p>2. In regards to your question "how shall I discriminate between the two (other than color)". You need to clarify what you mean. Contractor indicated that no additional information was need.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment is to extend the due date of quotes to 11:00AM EST, 1 April 2009. Additionally, to provide further Brand Name justification. The application for the Varian 320 is the determination of Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs), Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs) and Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) in vapor and liquid. Experience with vapor analysis of CWAs, TICs and TIMs in real time in a vapor state.  ADTs lab is monitoring the concentration of compounds in real time without any chromatographic interface to slow down the rate of analysis.  Data has been provided by Varian to show that they have performed this type of analysis. In order to receive the most complete information available regarding target analyte composition in various matrices, the mass spectrometer must utilize a triple quadrupole mass analyzer for efficient MS/MS analyses.  LC/MS is a soft ionization technique, and for the best detection of analytes of interest in complex, dirty matrices as well as allowing for structural elucidation MS/MS must be utilized.  This will allow for MS/MS analysis of low-level analytes in a dirty matrix such as the water, vapor and contaminant samples ADT expects to encounter.<BR>The mass spectrometer must utilize temperature programmable drying gas temperature which can be manipulated throughout an analysis.  As some of the analytes ADT is interested in degrade with increased temperature and others need higher drying gas temperatures to be efficiently ionized, a system which incorporates temperature programmable drying gas is essential.<BR>In order to be the most robust and simple analyzer possible, the instrument must use one tune file for both the optics and analyzer.  Multiple tune files make for complex analysis conditions for the operator.  A single tune file will allow ADT to be more efficient with time.<BR>The mass spectrometer must also come equipped with both an Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization (APCI) interface as well as an Electrospray Ionization (ESI) interface.  As not all compounds are responsive to ESI, an APCI interface is absolutely necessary for our types of analyses.<BR>In order to maximize bench space the mass spectrometer must utilize a 180 collision cell and must have dimensions of not more than 15 in/38 cm (h) x 19.5 in/50 cm (w) x 28 inch/71 cm (d).  Bench space is critical in the lab, and any extra space made available will contribute to the productivity of the lab.The mass spectrometer must utilize a lensless design for the analyzer.  The curved collision cell and lensless analyzer design increase sensitivity by reducing chemical noice in the mass spectrometer and increasing ion transmission.  Both of the features increase the overall sensitivity of the instrument.<BR>To have the most flexible system available, the mass spectrometer must be able to be converted by the lab personnel from an LC/MS/MS to a GC/MS/MS with an optional interface kit.  As our project may change over time, this feature would allow us to simply convert the instrument rather than buy a completely new GC/MS/MS.  This changeover can be accomplished by lab personnel while not requiring vendor intervention. ADT laboratories, for reasons listed above, requires a Liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer with the features listed.  Varian is the only manufacturer of a Liquid Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer that includes these features.  Therefore, it is in the best interest of our laboratory for this purchase to be performed as a brand sole source to Varian for their 320MS with APCI Ionization Chamber.<BR>

<p>Delivery of interim and final report(s) shall be made to the NOAA COR and contracting officer that will be identified at time of award.</p>
<p>Timely proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Contracting Officer shall make a best value award decision based on the following evaluation factors: Proposals will be evaluated against the requirements of the RFP and in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth below to determine the Offeror's demonstrated ability to perform the services required. General statements such as "the vast resources of our nationwide company will be used to perform the services required by the Statement of Work" are not sufficient. The Offeror shall clearly address each element of the proposal. Any proposal failing to address all of the elements may be considered indicative of the Offeror's lack of understanding in response to the Government's requirements and may be considered unacceptable. Factor I - Technical Concept- the Technical Concept meets the requirement utilizing commercially available products and services to the maximum extent possible. The technical concept is clear, concise and complete. Factor II - Organizational Resources -The Offeror demonstrates an ability to provide the proposed service through one or more of the following subfactors: documented ownership of necessary assets; documented investor interest; and maturity of business case including independent review or valuation. Factor III Past Performance - Past performance will be evaluated based on information provided by the offeror as to actual sales of similar studies or services to industry or government agencies (contractor format for past performance data is desired). Past performance will consider the reviews/ratings of other users who presently use or used offerors services. Offerors must include records of at least three recent sales, within the last 5 years, and identify a point of contact for each by providing a name and telephone number. Failure to submit past performance information (or to address past performance) with your proposal will result in your proposal being made non responsive. Factor IV - Price. The government is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the proposal. To ensure sufficient information is available, vendors must furnish as part of their proposal all descriptive material necessary for the Government to determine whether the services/study meets technical requirements. Technical capability combined with past performance is significantly more important than price, and the contracting officer may make award to other than the lowest priced offeror. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.</p>
<p>Offerors shall complete their annual representations and certification at http://orca.bpn.gov and complete para. (b) of 52.212-3 or, if annual certifications not completed, complete and sign para (c) through (m) of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (FEB 2009) with its offer.

<DESC>Amendment 0002- The following amendment is to answer questions andchange two part onmidirectional antenna to two port omnidirectional antenna.The proposal due date and time is not extended.Questions and AnswersQuestion 1. You make reference to the "Antenna" (singular) should operate at200 watts, should be lightweight, etc. You also list top and bottom radiatordimensions not to exceed "36" and "69" respectively. Can you confirm that thesolicitation is for (1) antenna system which employs (2) separately functioningantennas operating in the specified frequency range, with (2) separate antennacabling assemblies, each one feeding the (2) separately functioning antennas?In other words, one antenna assembly with (2) independent antennas coveringthe 30-88 MHz range, one stacked on top of the other one?Answer: The understanding above is one alternative technical solution that willmeet the specifications; however, the Government's requirement is for acommercial two port omnidirectional antenna (singular) mounted in a stackedconfiguration.Question 2.  The reason for clarification is that you have different max sizesforthe top and bottom radiators and refer to the assembly in the singular. If youwant (2) antennas similarly designed, I would presume that the difference inradiator lengths is to limit the overall size?Answer 2:  As stated in Answer 1, the requirement is for one antenna; however,if an alternative proposal is submitted, the overall size limitations remainunchanged.Question 3: Also, are the cable assemblies separate items to be attached atthe antenna with surface mounted receptacles on the antenna, or are the cableassemblies to be an integral part of the antenna? Also, if to plug in, are thecable assemblies meant to plug in on the side of the antenna assembly orplug in at the base on the bottom side of the antenna tube. Please advise ifthere is a preference for design considerations.Answer 3: Either solution identified is technically acceptable; however, thepreference is for surface mounted receptacles on the antenna.Question 4: Is this a replacement for an existing antenna in use and are theredesign drawings available? If not, will the proposed antenna need to gothrough first article testing. If so, is there a schedule for that upon award?Answer 4: Since this antenna is a commercial item, first article testing willnotbe performed and drawings are not available.  This purchase is not areplacement; however, these antennas will augment antennas currently in use.Those antennas are COM 228 by Atlantic Microwave Division Sensor andAntenna Systems (COBHAM).Question 5: Why the specifications list separate SWR and gain figures for eachelement?Answer 5:  The specifications listed match the specifications of the antennaalready in use. See answer 4.Amendment 0001- This amendment is to delete the attachment and includeinformation in the description and change the delivery requirement to 150 daysor sooner.This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared inaccordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented withadditional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutesthe only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitationwill not be issued.

Please clarify if the T700 Test Cell is to be proposed and priced as an option to the basic ATF3 Test Cell Upgrade; b:) Is it the USCG intention to award a single contract for the upgrade of both test cells? c.) In paragraph 9.0 of the SOO it states the period of performance as 12 months from contract award and that the shutdown, disassembly of the existing systems, upgrades, and correlation is desired to be completed within 90 days. Is the stated period of performance and the desired 90 days out of service time apply to the upgrade of both the ATF3 and T700 test cells? Does the USCG have a preference for the sequencing of the upgrade of the ATF3 and T700 Test Cells?

A31: Both the ATF3 and the T700/CT7 upgrades are now included in the base requirement.  The upgrades will be done consecutively; the ATF3 will be dropped and upgraded first. When those upgrades are completed the T700 Cell will be dropped and upgraded. The 90 days is for each cell independently. 

Q32: It is assumed that the USCG intends to maintain the use of the existing ATF3-6 engine adapters and ASE 50K thrust stand. Is it a requirement to replace the existing BLM Electronics Load Cell?

A32: Yes, the USCG intends to maintain the use of the engine adapters and thrust stand; however, they are to be overhauled with new mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic and electrical connections. Load cells are to be recommended by the vendor.

Q33: The current ATF3 Test Cell has an engine ECU mounted in the operator console. Will an ATF3 ECU be provided as GFE for this upgrade effort?

A33: Yes, an EEC will be provided as GFE.

Q34: Paragraph 5.0 of the SOO lists Fuel as a system requiring upgrade. Please clarify the extent of the upgrade to be performed for the existing fuel systems in both the ATF3 and T700 Test Cells. Is this upgrade to include replacement of the existing turbine flow meters, fuel filtering, fuel pumps, etc.?

A34: Flow meters and flow controls need upgrades; vendor is to provide recommendations.

Q35: According to the SOO the contractor is upgrade the Data Reduction systems in both the ATF3 and T700 Test Cells. Does this upgrade pertain to the computer hardware only? We are assuming that the USCG currently owns the latest versions of the engine OEM Data Reduction Software for these engine models. Will the USCG provide the OEM Data Reduction Software as GFE?

A35: The upgrades apply to both hardware and software. The USCG cannot provide OEM proprietary software.

Q36: Paragraph 5.0 of the SOO states that the upgrade is to include FOD screens. Does this apply to both the ATF3, T700, and CT7 engines? Please clarify that this applies to replacing only the existing FOD screens and not replacement of the entire inlet bell assemblies.

A36: ATF3 inlet bell will not be replaced, only refurbished. T700 will depend on choice of load system.

Q37:  Paragraph 5.0 of the SOO states that the upgrade is to include Bypass Ducting. Please clarify the USCG intent for the upgrade of the bypass ducting and to which test cell this applies.

A37: Bypass Ducting applies to the ATF3 cell and will need to be refurbished or replaced depending on vendor recommendations.

Q38: Paragraph 5.0 of the SOO states that the upgrade is to include Hot Shrouds. Please clarify the USCG intent for the upgrade of the hot shrouds and to which test cell this applies.

A39: Hot shrouds apply to the ATF3 cell and will need to be refurbished or replaced depending on vendor recommendatons.

Q40: Paragraph 5.0 of the SOO states that the upgrade effort is to include Vibration and Trim Balance Analyzer. Is a Vibration and Trim Balance Analyzer required to be provided for both the ATF3 and T700 Test Cells? If so, does the USCG have a preference for the provided system?

A41: Yes the requirement is for both cells, and no there is no preference.

Q42: The SOO states that the upgrade efforts for both the ATF3 and T700 Test Cells are to include an upgrade of the System Power. It is assumed that this applies to the electrical power distributed through the test cell instrumentation and engine/facility controls. Please clarify the extent of the upgrade of the system power in each test cell. Please provide a definition of the power available for use with the existing test cells.

A42: The upgrade effort is to separate the input power and to be independently isolated from the other cells.

Q43: The current ATF3 Test Cell has a Model 294300 Tester installed on the operator control console. Please clarify the usage of this piece of equipment.

A43: The Model 294300 Tester is a HU-25 line test box to allow operator interface and Test point verification according to OEM test manual and Test Cell procedures.

Q44: During the Industry Day site visit, the USCG showed an existing water system for potential use with a water dynamometer load system in the T700 test cell. Was this cooling water system previously used for a water dynamometer system for T700 engine testing? Is it the USCG preference to upgrade the T700 Test Cell with a water dynamometer system?

A44: No, it was used for Test Cell #2 operations. It would be available for use and or upgrade provided both #2 and #3 cells could be operated simultaneously. The USCG is seeking vendor recommendations for an effective and accurate dynamometer system.

Q45: Please provide confirmation that the existing cooling water circulation system is in good working order and no additional upgrades are required, if the contractor decides to propose the use of this system.

A45: The current system is being maintained but has not been operated for 2 years.

Q46: If the USCG intends to utilize a water dynamometer system as part of the upgrade of the T700 Test Cell, potentially significant construction will need to be conducted for the proper mounting of the engine stand/dynamometer system. Can the USCG provide construction detail drawings of the test cell concrete flooring and services installed below the flooring?

A46: Yes, facility drawings have now been uploaded to FBO.  Additionally, any significant construction must be identified and priced separately.  The Aviation Logistics Center does not have contracting authority for significant construction.  Only minor construction integral to the work may be authorized.

Q47: If a water dynamometer system is used as part of the upgrade of the T700 Test Cell, will the contractor be required to remove the existing air dynamometer exhaust ducting from the test cell and seal the roof penetration?

A47: Yes.

Q48: According to Factor IV  Quality Indicators in Addenda M, the quality indicators shall include proof of ISO certification. Does this mean that contractors are required to be ISO certified? Does this apply to major subcontractors?

A48: Prime contractor shall be responsible for its subcontractors.

Q49: In accordance with paragraph 3.0 of the SOO, ******* requests a copy of the Facility Drawings.

A49: Yes, facility drawings have been uploaded to FBO.

Q50:  In your answer to question 11, you state, The water-cooling tower and pump room for the middle Cell can be modified by the vendor to allow for two operational cells.

A50: Yes, that was stated.

Q51: I cannot access the links provided on Fedbizopps for the picture file.  Are the pictures still posted on the governments site?  Is there any other media I can obtain these pictures, they would be very helpful.

A51: Photos are still on the FBO website.  However, anyone unable to access them may request them from the Contract Specialist at ginger.g.woodington@uscg.mil.

Q52: Do you have a technical library that hosts the Military overhaul publications referenced on page 4-5 of the SOO?

A52: The engine publications are proprietary to the OEMs and can not be provided prior to award of contract.  Contractor must obtain independently if needed prior to award.

Q53: Could you check this and or arrange that I can pull down the Photo files?

A53: Photo files have been uploaded to FBO.  If you cannot open them, a .zip file is available upon request to ginger.g.woodington@uscg.mil.

Q54: Can you tell me where we can pull down the overhaul publications for this system/engine? 

A54: The engine publications are proprietary to the OEMs and can not be provided prior to award of contract.  Contractor must obtain independently if needed prior to award.

Q55: Can you direct me to the coast guard library that may host such publications for this ATF3 or other engines/equipment?

A55: The engine publications are proprietary to the OEMs and can not be provided prior to award of contract.  Contractor must obtain independently if needed prior to award.

Q56: Do you have a technical library that hosts the Military overhaul publications referenced on page 4-5 of the SOO?

A56: The engine publications are proprietary to the OEMs and can not be provided prior to award of contract.  Contractor must obtain independently if needed prior to award.

Q57: Can the test cell be modified to include a sump underneath the test
stand for collection of dynamometer outlet water to be pumped back to
the cooling system?

A58: The water system should be a closed loop system to re-circulate water from a dynamometer back to the cooling system.  The facility currently has a drain system that feeds back to the oily-water separator.

Q59:  Does the capability currently exist to move engines or removable
engine cradles in and out of the test cell or do you require that the
complete test stand be on a trolley so it can be moved in and out?

A59: For the T700 Cell, a fixed test stand would be preferred.  It must have the ability to load the engine by a movable engine cart.  The ATF3 Cell requires a trolley to load the engine/adapter assembly.

Q60:  Regarding the existing water supply, what is currently available to
the test cell for the following parameters:A. Maximum and minimum supply pressure; 
B. Maximum inlet temperature; C. Maximum allowable outlet temperature; D. Minimum flow rate at 36 deg. C or other specified temperature.

<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for innovative research in Measurement and Signatures Intelligence (MASINT) Technology Development (MTD). The MTD BAA seeks significant advances in collection, processing, exploitation, dissemination, and information fusion in the six MASINT sub disciplines. This may also include simulation and modeling of such systems. These include:</p>
<p>1. Electro-Optical - technologies for the detection and exploitation of relevant phenomena by electro-optical sensors to include laser intelligence (LASINT), Overhead Non-imaging Infrared (ONIR), Thermal IR (TIR), and spectroscopy. LASINT technologies may also include sensitive and specific methods of identifying and diagnosing laser eye injuries.<br /><br />2. Radar - technologies to include Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Inverse SAR, Line of Sight (LOS), Over the Horizon (OTH), and bi-static radar.<br /><br />3. Nuclear - technologies to perform active or passive, remote or close detection, collection and measurement of gamma rays, neutrons, x-rays or other ambient radiation from nuclear sources.<br /><br />4. Materials - technologies to collect, characterize and identify materials, point of origin by remote or close-in means to include nuclear materials, biological threats to include the identification of infectious agents of military importance. Investigations may include improvements in the dissemination of intelligence information to medical personnel through improvements in bioinformatics and data management systems.<br /><br />5. Radio Frequency - Seek technology to collect, process, and exploit signals intelligence from Ultra Wideband (UWB), Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP), High Power Microwave (HPM), Unintended RF Emissions (URE or RINT) threats.<br /><br />6. Geophysical - seek new capabilities for persistent surveillance of areas of interest using seismic, magnetic, acoustic, hydroacoustic or multi-discipline approaches.</p>
<p>Additional topic area:</p>
<p>White papers are being sought to enhance Space Situational Awareness by providing automated knowledge tools and decision aids that utilize state-of-the-art multi-sensor exploitation techniques for the purpose of improving characterization performance and reducing operational analyst workload. Technologies leading to the rapid improvement of capabilities for signature characterization of resident space objects and determination of adversarial intent are needed. These tools should provide new capabilities for more effective exploitation of complementary multi-source sensor and intelligence data for improved Space Situational Awareness. Development of tools and techniques that equip the operational analyst to provide timely and highly accurate signature characterization of RSOs leading to threat analysis is increasingly critical to addressing multiple Space Domain issues. The focus of these technologies is to provide direct assistance to the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC), National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC), and associated DoD and intelligence community partners.<br />Recommended date for white papers on this topic area is 10 November 2008.</p>

<DESC><p>This is the second amendment to the original presolicitation notice for Request for Proposal (RFP) number FA8807-09-R-0003 posted on 24 November 2008. This amendment makes several changes. It includes a Federally Funded Research and Development Center statement and an updated release date with additional information. The Global Positioning Systems (GPS) Wing expects to release Request for Proposal (RFP) number FA8807-09-R-0003 for the Advanced GPS Control Segment (OCX) prior to 10 April 2009. This announcement will be updated on the actual date of RFP release. GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS users process satellite signals to determine accurate position, velocity, and time. GPS is an Acquisition Category ID program. GPS must comply with 10 United State Code (USC) 2281, which requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes; and 42 USC 14712, which requires that GPS comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541712 and the size standard used is 1,000 employees.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OCX will provide command, control, and mission support for the GPS Block II and III satellites as well as support to existing and new interfaces. OCX, in conjunction with the modernization of the GPS Block II and the introduction of GPS Block III assures reliable and secure delivery of enhanced position and timing signals to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.</p>
<p>This is a Phase B acquisition for OCX that is heavily dependent upon the Phase A work performed on contracts with Northrop Grumman and Raytheon resulting from solicitation number FA8807-07-R-0001. Work performed under the Phase B contract will include development of OCX Blocks 1.0 and 2.0. Block 1.0 will replace existing legacy GPS command and control system and allow for use of the modernized capabilities (L2C, L5, M-Code) currently on or planned to be on orbit. In addition to Block 1.0 capabilities, Block 2.0 will integrate GPS IIIA satellite capabilities into the baseline and ensure availability of OCX to be synchronized to support launch, telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&amp;C), on-orbit checkout and operations of the first GPS IIIA satellite. This contract will also include options for interim contractor support, transition support, special studies, and sustainment for up to five years.</p>
<p>The award decision for Phase B will be based in part upon an evaluation of the content from Phase A data deliverables including, but not limited to, Integrated Master Schedule, Software Development Plan, Software Architecture Description, Human Engineering Program Plan, Control Segment Transition Plan, System Engineering Management Plan, Segment and Software System Measurement Report, Facilities Plan, Integrated Support Plan, Risk Assessment Report; and a Modernized Capability Engineering Model (MCEM) Technical Demonstration. MCEM Technical Demonstration Instructions are available from the contracting POCs below. In addition, the Government will consider relevant past performance on the contracts awarded in response to solicitation number FA8807-09-R-0001. Offerors will be given 45 days from release of RFP to deliver their proposals. Response from small business and small disadvantaged businesses is encouraged.</p>
<p>BIDDERS LIBRARY<br />The RFP and attachments can be found under Bidders-OCX at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.</p>
<p>The DoD mandates the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than a username and password, before granting access.</p>
<p>In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the OCX RFP or any of the aforementioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components:</p>
<p>(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software.</p>
<p>(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate<br />http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html</p>
<p>This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee.</p>
<p>OMBUDSMAN: The Space and Missiles System Center Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill. You can reach him at james.gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns with potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. The Ombudsman will not participate in the evaluation of the proposals or the source selection process for this acquisition.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the SAFETY Act and FAR 50.205-2(b)(1)(i), GPSW is requesting a pre-qualification designation notice and it is under review by DHS.</p>
<p>Federally Funded Research and Development Centers may provide unique capabilities that an offeror may want to utilize. Part 35.017 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations provides the policy and process to obtain such services.</p>
<p>The Global Systems Positioning (GPS) Wing expects to release the RFP Request prior to <br />10 April 2009. This announcement will be updated on the actual date of RFP release.</p>

<DESC>In order to finalize the acquisition strategy on the Safety, Environmental andMission Assurance Services (SEMAS) requirement, NASA Ames Research Center is requestingindustry input regarding the use of the Multiple Award contracting method for the SEMASrequirement; specifically, an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) MultipleAward Contract (MAC) with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Task Orders. Multiple Award IDIQ contracts allow NASA to ensure continued competition as specificrequirements are identified during the period of performance of the contract.  TheGovernment believes that this approach will maximize the likelihood it will receive thebest value considering not only cost but also technical capability of the contractor. Moreover, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), the ContractingOfficer must, to the maximum extent practicable, give preference to making multipleawards of indefinite-quantity contracts under a single solicitation for the same orsimilar supplies or services to two or more sources. Accordingly, NASA seeks industryinput as outlined in the specific questions provided below.  This input will be used, inconjunction with other information available to the Government, to decide whether or notto implement a MAC approach for the SEMAS requirement. Industry feedback will beinstrumental in helping us make this decision.We seek industry feedback, both positive and negative, as each respondent deemsappropriate.  We ask that your reply also state why you took the position you did inorder to help us with context. In your response, please address the following questions:1)	How would you structure a MAC for the SEMAS requirement? Please provide anoverview of how this could work.2)	What are the benefits of the MAC approach? Please explain your answer.3)	What are the costs/negative aspects of the MAC approach?  Please explain youranswer.4)	What impact would a MAC have on small businesses proposing as prime? How wouldpriming strategy change compared to a single award contract? 5)	How many contract awards should be made for participating in the MAC?6)	Would a MAC environment affect your subcontract/teaming arrangements?  If yes,please explain.7)	Would a MAC affect incumbent capture and employee retention?  If yes, pleaseexplain.8)	Describe your view of the mechanics of the task order competition process,addressing timeliness, efficiency and fairness.   a.	How would related efforts performed by different contractors under different taskorders be integrated? Assume integration would not be performed by the Government. b.	How will the task orders be managed at the overall program level?c.	What should be the duration of the task orders (i.e., how often should the taskorders be re-competed)?9)	Most SEMAS services are on-going; therefore, the Government desires continuity ofservices between close-out and phase-in of task orders.  How does industry envisioncontinuity if the follow-on task orders are awarded to a different contractor? 10)	What cost savings to the Government could be realized utilizing a MAC? If youthink there would be a cost savings, please provide specifics.11)	How could the contractor achieve cost/staffing efficiencies in a MAC environment?12)	How could a MAC affect schedule performance? Assume ARC has a new requirement(new task order) that requires quick turnaround time. How could this new task order bequickly competed among contractors to accommodate an urgent requirement?13)	Some of the on-going services require immediate response and vary in complexity.For example, a reported hazard may require immediate assessment. Could an unpredictablesituation be priced in a fixed price task order environment? Please explain.Please submit all responses no later than 4:00PM (PST), Friday, April 3, 2009. Pleaserespond via electronic mail (e-mail) to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Robin Wong, at thefollowing address: Robin.L.Wong@nasa.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 611699   The purpose of this modification is to provide the "Questions and Answers" for this solicitation.  They are:
    *  Question No. 1: As an value added proposition for the government, is it acceptable for the contractor to provide additional weapons (M-4?s & Glock-17?s) in place of a factory armorer? In the event of an operators weapon failure, an immediate replacement will be available on the range which will reduce down time normally required by a factory armorer to repair.
    * Answer No. 1: This would be acceptable only if Glock Model 19's are available, as this is the duty sidearm for EPA Agents.
    * Question No. 2: Required intructor to student ratio.
    * Answer No. 2: As appropriate for officer safety purposes. 1:5 or 1:6 is commonplace in this arena of training.

<DESC><p>The contract provides for non-personal advisory and assistance services to fully support Aerospace Research, Development, Test and Evaluation activities at the Air Force Flight Test Center. The Aerospace Research, Development, Test and Evaluation Advisory and Assistance Services (ARDTEAS) program primarily focuses on robust systems engineering and technical assistance (SE/TA) services. It embraces strategic and enterprise-wide concepts by making these services available in support of interrelated and joint RDT&amp;E efforts for partnering and alliance units such as, but not limited to, AFFTC&rsquo;s Western Range Partners (Nevada Test and Training Range, Utah Test and Training Range and Electronic Combat Range), System Program Offices, Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center, Science and Technology Communities, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and National Aeronautical Space Administration. An enterprise-wide approach provides, in terms of benefits, the ability to expand and create new relationships in pursuit of shared developments, new technical areas, e.g. directed energy, and unmanned aerial vehicles, and maximize synergies, efficiencies and interoperabilities within and between these units to fully support systems from concept to combat.</p>
