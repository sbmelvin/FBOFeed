<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, New York & New Jersey Health Care Network - South (VISN 2 South) intends to award an urgent and necessary short-term bridge sole-source, firm fixed price FSS Task Order (FSS-TO) to Tosoh Bioscience, Inc., FSS Contract # V797D-40130, 6000 Shoreline Court, South San Francisco, CA 94080 in accordance with FAR Subpart 8.405-6. 

The acquisitions sought is a Bridge FSS-TO that will cover 6 months of reagents, consumables, supplies needed to produce a cost-per-reportable result (CPRR) and for the continued usage of contractor-owned equipment currently on-site at VISN 2 South Medical Centers.

VA personnel utilize the equipment and reagents to perform patient Hemoglobin A1c testing. The NAICS is 334516 with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees

This FSS-TO is needed to avoid any interruption in this critical care lab service provided to our VISN2 veterans.

The FSS-TO will be effective January 1, 2019 through June 30, 2019 and may include options (90-day only) whose exercise will be wholly dependent on the resolution of issues around CPRR vs. other price schedule structures included or not included in FSS contracts which only became known to NCO2 through vendor responses to a previous  sources sought  RFI notice in September 2018.

The current FSS-TO with Tosoh will expire on December 31, 2018 and this Bridge FSS-TO is needed to continue to provide HbA1c testing until a new long-term 5-year FSS-BPA or IDIQ is awarded later this year.  We anticipate the solicitation will be forthcoming shortly pending the resolution of the aforementioned issue over CPRR price schedules. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation will be made available. 

Please direct all inquiries to the contracting officer listed below by 3:00 PM (EST) on December 12, 2018 . 

Any inquiries received after December 12, 2018 may still be considered part of our market research, and if applicable, be used for the purposes of determining the market place for the upcoming long-term procurement. The Government will not pay for information submitted. Any information submitted in response to this notice of intent is strictly voluntary. 

This will be the only notice of the Government's intent to award to one source to satisfy this requirement.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

<p>Type of Contract:	Time-and-material (T&amp;M) with 1 Base Year and 2 Option Year Periods.<br /> Multiple awards may result from this solicitation.</p>
<p>Submission and Award:	The Government intends to hire one Associate Director PSC and one Director PSC. The Government will evaluate the received quotes on the first week of each month (the first round of evaluation will occur the first week of January 2019). The Government intends to extend this RFQ until either or both positions are filled. MCC may close the RFQ once qualified PSCs are selected. Offerors are permitted to apply to either Associate-Director-level or Director-level position or both levels (if qualified for both positions) for MCC's consideration. An offeror cannot fill both positions however; MCC will award two awards to two separate individuals.</p>
<p>1.	Introduction and Background</p>
<p>MCC's mission is to provide grant assistance to support economic growth and poverty reduction in select developing countries with a demonstrated commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. MCC's partner countries enter into a five-year agreement (Compact) with MCC that includes a plan for achieving shared development objectives and the responsibilities of each country in achieving those objectives. Our model is defined by core principles, of selectivity, country ownership, transparency, and a focus on results.</p>
<p>Our values identify who we are and what is important to us. Our Values are CLEAR: Embrace Collaboration, Always Learn, Practice Excellence, Be Accountable and Respect individuals and ideas. MCC's values define how we behave on a daily basis, both as individuals and as an institution, in pursuit of our mission. They guide how we make decisions, set priorities, address challenges, manage tradeoffs, recruit and develop staff, and work together with our country partners and stakeholders.</p>
<p>2.	Scope of Position</p>
<p>Our model is defined by principles of selectivity, country ownership, transparency, and a focus on results. Our values identify who we are and what is important to us. MCC's values are CLEAR - Collaboration, Learning, Excellence, Accountability and Respect. We recruit staff that will embody and uphold these values.</p>
<p>This position is located on the Program Procurement Practice Group, Sector Operations Division within the Department of Compact Operations. The Program Procurement Practice Group oversees the procurement activities required to implement an MCC-funded Compact. The procurement efforts are conducted by the host country MCA using MCC-provided procurement guidelines and standard bidding documents, which are based on the World Bank procurement guidelines and standard bidding documents. MCC Compact-funded procurements are not conducted using the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).</p>
<p>The PSC will report to and be supervised by the Practice Lead and Senior Director (PLSD) for PROC.</p>
<p>This position is not authorized to supervise any Federal employees.</p>
<p>3.	Personal Services Contract</p>
<p>MCC is authorized to enter into a contract with an individual as a Personal Services Contractor (PSCs) under the authority of Section 614(a) (8) of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003.</p>
<p>A personal services contract is different from non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSCs is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (see FAR 7.502). By law and by the contract's terms, the PSCs is subject to most of the laws, rules and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances and financial disclosure. However, under the MCC personal services contract authority, PSCs are not employees for purposes of laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The following elements apply to this contract:<br />(1)	Performance in Washington, DC USA, MCC eligible countries, other US and foreign cities (as required for outreach purposes), and/or at the PSC's home of record.<br />(2)	Principal tools and equipment may be furnished by the Government.<br />(3)	Services are applied directly to the integral effort of agencies or an organizational subpart in furtherance of assigned function or mission.<br />(4)	Comparable services, meeting comparable needs, are performed in the same or similar agencies using civil service personnel.<br />(5)	The need for the type of service provided can reasonably be expected to last beyond 1 year.<br />(6)	The inherent nature of the service, or the manner in which it is provided, reasonably requires directly or indirectly, Government direction or supervision of contractor employees in order to-<br />(i)	Adequately protect the Government's interest;<br />(ii)	Retain control of the function involved; or<br />(iii)	Retain full personal responsibility for the function supported in a duly authorized Federal officer or employee.</p>
<p>4.	Key Requirements</p>
<p>Awardee must satisfy the following key requirements:<br />&bull;	U.S. citizenship.<br />&bull;	Must be able to obtain and maintain a federal security clearance.<br />&bull;	Performance in Washington, DC USA, MCC eligible countries, other US and foreign cities (as required for outreach purposes), and/or at the PSC's home of record.<br />&bull;	Domestic and international travel will be required.<br />&bull;	Statement of Employment &amp; Financial Interest (e.g., Office of Government Ethics "OGE Form-450" or similar statement) may be required.<br />&bull;	Active System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) registration (this is a free, Government website) and be listed as sole-proprietor.<br />&bull;	Designated and/or random drug testing required.</p>

<p>b)	Travel</p>
<p>MCC estimates that the incumbent will be required to undertake 4-6 international trips annually.</p>
<p>c)	Supervisory Controls</p>
<p>The PSC is delegated unlimited authority for planning and carrying out the procurement activities required to successfully implement an MCC funded Compact. The supervisor is available for consultation on program objectives, budgetary constraints, and procurement policy interpretations. Decisions and recommendations of the employee are normally accepted as authoritative, although higher review may be necessary for some phases of the work. Employee must demonstrate ability to fulfill responsibilities with a minimum of supervision.

<p>d)	Guidelines</p>
<p>Guidelines include the MCC Program Procurement Guidelines (PPGs), Standard Bidding Documents (SBDs), procurement principles, procurement guidance papers, broad policy statements and basic legislation and require extensive interpretation and latitude in developing best business practices within the confine of the country Compacts. The MCC PPGs may require interpretation. Only limited contractual precedents may exist to guide the employee in developing and modifying procurement strategies or agency procurement guidelines.</p>
<p>e)	Complexity</p>
<p>The work is characterized by breadth of planning, review, and coordination or depth of problem identification and analysis, stemming from the variety of the procurement functions or from unknown changes or conflicts inherent in the issues. Assignments are characterized by broad and intense efforts and involve several phases being pursued concurrently or sequentially with the support of technical and management personnel within and outside the organization. Decisions involve responsiveness to continuing changes in programs or technological developments. Procurements may require new or modified contract terms and conditions, funding arrangements, or policy interpretation throughout the pre- award and post-award phases.</p>
<p>f)	Scope and Effect</p>
<p>The employee will be responsible for overseeing implementation of Compact procurements in assigned countries. The employee is expected to place strong emphasis on management of the procurement lifecycle starting with planning, through development of bidding documents, conducting evaluations/selections, negotiating and awarding contracts, and administering and closing out contracts. <br />The purpose of the work is to provide expert, authoritative, and compliant procurement advice, resolve critical procurement implementation problems, develop innovative procurement approaches for use by MCC or MCA procurement specialists or management/program officials, or for use in planning, negotiating, awarding, administering, and/or settling the termination of major procurements in Compact Countries. The employee assists in the development of procurement processes/procedures and enhances the overall procurement capacity of the MCA Entity.</p>
<p>g)	Personal Contacts/Purpose of Contacts</p>
<p>Personal contacts include a wide variety of specialists, managers, officials, or groups from within and outside MCC in a moderately unstructured setting where the purpose and extent of each contact is usually different, and the role and authority of each party is identified and developed during the course of the contact. The majority of the contacts will be located in the MCA country outside the US.</p>
<p>h)	Physical Demands</p>
<p>The work is primarily sedentary, although some walking, bending, or carrying of light items may be involved. Travel may be required.</p>
<p>i)	Work Environment</p>
<p>Work is performed in an office setting, although there is an expectation of work in the field.</p>
