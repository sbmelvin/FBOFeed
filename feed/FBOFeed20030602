<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Other Than Commercial Item. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Government intends to acquire the other than commercial item using the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for Layered Barrier Coatings.  Scope of Work:  NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) has requirements to produce a series of multi-layer ceramic oxide coatings with selected compositions and rare earth doping levels to achieve thermal protection, environmental protection, as well as temperature and erosion sensing functions for coated turbine engine components. NASA coating designs shall be implemented to produce protective coatings on NASA-provided substrates that shall be coated and delivered to NASA for testing of coating performance. All coatings shall be deposited on 1¡¨ diameter coupons for performance testing, however, depositions must be performed in a system of sufficiently large dimensions where identical coatings could later be deposited onto turbine engine components such as turbine blades or vanes. All coatings shall be deposited continuously by the Contractor, with no interruption between layers, by electron-beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) using industry standard deposition conditions and rates. Depositions shall be performed in an industrial scale or industrial prototype EB-PVD facility in order to achieve the deposition rates necessary for industry-standard coatings. Continuous deposition is essential in order to achieve the continuous columnar microstructure that provides the coatings with their required strain tolerance. The layered coatings and rare-earth doping shall be produced by co-evaporation of multiple ingot feedstocks along with mechanical shuttering. Coatings shall be deposited at elevated temperatures greater than 1000„aC by EB-radiant heat. Substrates provided by NASA will be one-inch diameter platimum-aluminide-coated Rene N5 superalloy substrates (PtAl/Rene N5) as well as sacrificial carbon substrates that will be used to produce freestanding coatings.	Statement of Work:  I. Luminescent dopant-layered TBCs  The Contractor shall deposit 7wt% yttria-stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) coatings incorporating selected rare earth oxide dopant layers that will function as damage or temperature indicators. The dopant-layered 7YSZ coatings shall be deposited onto PtAl/Rene N5 substrates as well as graphite substrates provided by NASA using the Contractors industrial prototype EB-PVD facility by co-evaporation of multiple ingot feed-stocks. The layered coatings shall be deposited in a continuous fashion without interruption between layers in order to achieve continuous columnar microstructure without distinct microstructural interfaces. Coatings deposition rate shall be equal to standard industrial practice. Coatings shall be deposited at elevated temperatures &gt;1000 0C by EB-radiant heat. Minimum of ten 1¡¨diam PtAl/Rene N5 substrates per run (except for exploratory runs 1 and 2) along with two 1¡¨ diameter graphite substrates. Europia (Eu2O3), terbia (Tb2O3), and dysprosia (Dy2O3) ingots with outer diameter (OD) = 1.05¡¨ shall be provided by NASA. 7YSZ ingot with OD = 1.94¡¨ shall be provided by NASA.  A The Contractor shall conduct single dopant layer (~3 at%) trial runs as a precursor to multiple dopant layer runs. Several runs for each dopant composition shall be performed for establishing the optimum deposition parameters that can then be applied in subsequent deposition runs #4 and #5.  Run #1: 6 mil Eu2O3-doped 7YSZ/PtAl/Rene N5 (to establish deposition parameters for co-evaporation of europia and 7YSZ ingots)  Run #2: 6 mil Tb2O3-doped 7YSZ/PtAl/Rene N5 (to establish deposition parameters for co-evaporation of terbia and 7YSZ ingots)  Run #3: 2 mil undoped 7YSZ/6 mil Eu2O3-doped 7YSZ/PtAl/Rene N5 (to gain experience with transition from doped to undoped layers)  B. The Contractor shall deposit multilayer doped TBCs (~3 at% dopant). Each layer shall have thickness 2 mils  Run #4: undoped 7YSZ/Eu2O3-doped 7YSZ/Tb2O3-doped 7YSZ/PtAl/Rene N5  Run #5: Same as Run #3 above but with lower Eu2O3 and Tb2O3 doping levels (&lt;1 at%)  Run #6: 7 mils undoped 7YSZ/1 mil Eu2O3-doped (3 at%) 7YSZ/PtAl/Rene N5  Run #7: 5 mils undoped 7YSZ/1 mil Eu2O3-doped (3at%) 7YSZ/PtAl/Rene N5  Run #8: 5 mils undoped 7YSZ/0.4 mil Eu2O3-doped (3at%) 7YSZ/PtAl/Rene N5  Run #9: 1 mil Eu2O3-doped (3 at%) 7YSZ/7 mils undoped 7YSZ/PtAl/Rene N5  Run #10: 1 mil Dy2O3-doped (1 at%)/6 mil undoped/1 mil Eu2O3-doped/PtAl/Rene N5  II. Environmental Barrier/Thermal Barrier Coating (EBC/TBC) interlayers  The Contractor shall deposit graded layers comprised of alternating layers of TBC and EBC compositions for the purpose of reducing the stress concentration at the EBC/TBC interface. The EBC composition shall be mullite and the TBC composition shall be either HfO2-27wt%Y2O3 or ZrO2-Y2O3¡VRe2O3 (Re = rare earth element). The number of layers shall range from 10 to 20 layers. Alternating composition sublayers shall have thickness ranging from 5 to 20 microns. Within these ranges, NASA shall specify the number of layers and the thickness of each individual sublayer. ZrO2-Y2O3¡VRe2O3 ingot (OD = 1.94¡¨) shall be provided by NASA. Mullite and HfO2-27wt%Y2O3 ingots shall be provided by vendor.  Runs #11 and 12: The Contractor shall deposit alternating layers of mullite and HfO2-27wt%Y2O3 onto EBC/Si-coated silicon carbide fiber reinforced silicon carbide matrix composite (SiC/SiC) substrates provided by NASA. The coatings deposited in runs 11 and 12 shall contain different numbers and thicknesses (within ranges described in preceding paragraph) of mullite and HfO2-27wt%Y2O3 layers as prescribed by NASA.  Run #13: The Contractor shall deposit alternating layers of mullite and ZrO2-Y2O3¡VRe2O3 onto EBC/Si-coated SiC/SiC substrates provided by NASA. The number of layers and the thickness of the individual layers shall be in the ranges described above and will be prescribed by NASA.  III. Highly Reflective Multi-Layer Coating  Radiation barrier coatings shall be deposited that will exhibit high infrared reflectance due to the coherent interference of reflections from interfaces between layers of Al2O3 and 7YSZ. Layers shall exhibit sharp interfaces and layer thicknesses shall follow requirements given below. The contractor shall deposit alternating layers of Al2O3 and 7YSZ by co-evaporating ingots while employing a rotating shutter. 7YSZ ingot (OD = 1.94¡¨) shall be supplied by NASA. Al2O3 ingot shall be provided by the vendor. Minimum of eight 1¡¨diam PtAl/Rene N5 substrates along with two 1¡¨ diameter graphite substrates. Substrates shall be supplied by NASA. The Contractor shall control layer thicknesses by increasing the shutter rotation speed with thickness adjustments of 5 nm increments. Al2O3 sublayers start at 765 nm thickness (next to substrate) and decrease to 115 nm thickness (at surface) in 5 nm increments. 7YSZ sublayers start at 740 nm (next to substrate) and decrease to 90 nm (at surface) in 5 nm increments.  Run #14: The Contractor shall deposit a total of 262 sublayers alternating between Al2O3 (odd-numbered layer) and 7YSZ (even-numbered layer). The initial odd-numbered layer (Al2O3) shall have thickness of 765 nm and each subsequent odd-numbered layer shall have thickness 5 nm less than previous odd-numbered layer until the last odd-number layer (layer 261) is deposited with a thickness of 115 nm. The initial even-numbered layer (7YSZ) shall have thickness of 740 nm and each subsequent even-numbered layer shall have thickness 5 nm less than previous even-numbered layer until the last even-numbered layer (layer 262 nm) is deposited with a thickness of 90 nm. Therefore, the layer thicknesses shall be as follows:  Starting closest to substrate,  Layer 1 = Al2O3, thickness = 765 nm  Layer 2 = 7YSZ, thickness = 740 nm  Decrease each succeeding composition sublayer by 5 nm,  Layer 3 = Al2O3, thickness = 760 nm  Layer 4 = 7YSZ, thickness = 735 nm  Continue decreasing sublayers by 5 nm increments until,	Layer 261 = Al2O3, thickness = 115 nm  Layer 262 = 7YSZ, thickness = 90 nm  Summary of Deliverables:  The Contractor shall deliver all coated specimens within 9 months of the contract award. NASA shall supply all substrates for deposition. For runs 1-10 and 14, substrates shall be a mixture of 1¡¨ diameter PtAl-coated Rene N5 superalloy substrates and 1¡¨ diameter graphite disks. For runs 11-13, substrates shall be EBC/Si-coated SiC substrates. The number of delivered coatings on each type of substrate for each run shall be as follows:  Run #1: 4 on PtAl/Rene N5, 2 on graphite  Run #2: 4 on PtAl/Rene N5, 2 on graphite  Run #3: 10 on PtAl/Rene N5, 2 on graphite  Run #4: 10 on PtAl/Rene N5, 2 on graphite  Run #5: 10 on PtAl/Rene N5, 2 on graphite  Run #6: 10 on PtAl/Rene N5, 2 on graphite	Run #7: 10 on PtAl/Rene N5, 2 on graphite  Run #8: 10 on PtAl/Rene N5, 2 on graphite  Run #9: 10 on PtAl/Rene N5, 2 on graphite  Run #10: 10 on PtAl/Rene N5, 2 on graphite  Run #11: 10 on EBC/Si-coated SiC  Run #12: 10 on EBC/Si-coated SiC  Run #13: 10 on EBC/Si-coated SiC	Run #14: 8 on PtAl/Rene N5, 4 on graphite  **NOTE TO PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS: OFFEROR MUST INCLUDE ADEQUATE INFORMATION IN THEIR QUOTATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THEIR OFFER MEETS THE ABOVE STATEMENT OF WORK** The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-13.

<DESC>Availability of Solicitation The solicitation for the Center of Excellence for Aircraft Noise and Aviation Emissions Mitigation is now available. The solicitation can be found at http://www.coe.faa.gov/ The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to establish an Air Transportation Center of Excellence (COE) for Aircraft Noise and Aviation Emissions Mitigation. The goal of this endeavor is to create a cost sharing partnership of academia, industry, and government that will initially focus on aircraft noise and aviation emissions mitigation. The purpose is to forge a union of public sector (FAA, airport authorities, state/local governments, etc.), private sector (airlines, manufacturers, etc.), and academic institutions to create a world-class consortium that will identify solutions for existing and anticipated airport noise problems.  The FAA expects that the COE shall perform basic research through engineering development and prototyping. To this end, the FAA is soliciting proposals from accredited institutions of higher education addressing the establishment of the aforementioned COE. The FAA intends to enter into cooperative agreements with the successful team members and thereafter award grants and delivery order contract(s) consisting of cost reimbursement, cost sharing, and/or fixed price. The FAA intends to invest between $900,000 and $1,750,000 in the first year and a minimum of $600,000 per year for the next two years of the COE. For more information on the FAA Centers of Excellence Program contact Dr. Patricia Watts, FAA COE Program Manager at patricia.watts@faa.gov.

<DESC>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) (BAA-03-04-FH) constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  Except for the Proposer Information Packet (PIP) (see below), no additional information is available, nor will a formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this notice be issued, requests for the same will be disregarded. INTRODUCTION:  The Department of Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Services Division, Southwest Branch, Fort Huachuca, AZ, acting on behalf of the US Army's RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate, is issuing this BAA to solicit proposals addressing innovative solutions to the manufacture of Advanced Uncooled Infrared (UCIR) Focal Plane Arrays (FPA).  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Total funding for this effort is expected to be to up to sixteen million dollars ($16M) over four years for this BAA.  Information in this BAA is supplemented by a Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) that provides further information on the eligibility, support, research areas, preparation and submission of proposals, and selection criteria.  It is available on the World Wide Web at <a href=http://www.nbc.gov/mantech.cfm> http://www.nbc.gov/mantech.cfm</a>.  This pamphlet may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, or official mail.  Send requests for PIP to the Department of Interior, Fort Huachuca by email to Jane_A_Bourne@nbc.gov or call 520-533-1642.  PROGRAM BACKGROUND:  The Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate seeks innovative solutions to addresses the development and refinement of the manufacturing processes for Advanced Uncooled Infrared Focal Plane Arrays. This BAA addresses the development and refinement of the manufacturing processes of the advanced small pixel uncooled detector and associated calibration and vacuum packaging technologies. The detector and packaging tasks will address the needs for both the 320x240 and 640x480 arrays, with emphasis placed on the 640x480 array. The overall goal is to substantially reduce the cost and improve the availability of these UCIR FPAs for current and future Army applications in order to maintain US warfighter overmatch.  These applications include soldier systems such as thermal weapon and man portable sights, unmanned air vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles, missile systems including MRM (TERM) and NetFires and surveillance systems. Ultimate applications of the advanced UCIR FPA technology beyond this BAA are anticipated to lie in systems supporting Future Combat Systems sensor technology and Objective Force sensors.                                                               PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:  Proposals are invited for innovative demonstrable manufacturing solutions to improve and implement a process design, fabrication, calibration and test approach for the UCIR FPA in order to obtain a 8X or more decrease in the 640x480 unit minimum cost relative to current costs.  This goal may be met by the proposal's demonstration of a projected unit production cost on the basis of a hypothetical production buy comprising not less than 100 640x480 units/week over a 24-month period by improving its manufacturing process.  This hypothetical buy in no way commits the government to actually place such orders.   A baseline lot shall be fabricated, upon which an analysis shall be conducted identifying manufacturing process steps that are low in yield, low in throughput or high in labor content, and may therefore benefit from manufacturing process initiatives to improve these areas.  These initiatives shall be developed and integrated into the process flow in a minimum of fifteen (15) subsequent UCIR FPA lots of at least 6 wafers to determine their viability and impact on overall cost reduction.  For each lot processed the overall cost of the UCIR FPA, assuming conditions in the paragraph above, shall be calculated.  The goal of the program is for the final lot cost to result in an overall 8X or more decrease in cost for 640x480 UCIR FPAs.  The final lot shall also demonstrate the capability to process and yield FPAs at a rate of 100 units / week. TECHNICAL AND RESEARCH AREA:  This BAA solicits proposals to improve Advanced Uncooled Infrared (UCIR) Focal Plane Array (FPA) manufacturing techniques. The offeror shall provide rationale for the allocation of funding between initiatives and UCIR FPA fabrication.  This rationale shall include the number and type of UCIR FPAs, and cost and risk of initiatives. The offeror shall support the integration of the UCIR FPAs developed herein into a minimum of two systems to demonstrate viability and performance.   The offeror shall discuss a method of technology transfer to provide processes developed on this program to other IR vendors.  This shall include process documentation and four industry wide program reviews. The manufacturing process initiatives chosen to reduce the overall cost of this assembly shall focus on improving yield, reducing labor content and increasing throughput. In general, the initiatives may be in the following areas: bolometer fabrication, vacuum packaging, and calibration and testing.  The use/development of a cost model is required.  The model shall predict the unit costs of the FPA while varying input parameters to include; i) quantity; ii) with and without integration of manufacturing process initiatives discussed above; iii) yield; iv) labor content and v) throughput. The performance requirements are given in Table 1 and the interface in Table 2, both of which are found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet.  There are several performance requirements listed as Contractor Furnished Information (CFI).  The elements designated as CFI are to be monitored during the Manufacturing Program.  On the basis of the results, cost trades can be performed during the course of the program. PROPOSAL PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:  See the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) which provides preparation and submission instructions for proposals.  It is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.nbc.gov/mantech.cfm  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION:  Proposals are due on or before 4:00 PM, Mountain Standard Time (not Mountain Daylight Time, which is one hour later), 14 July 2003 to the Department of the Interior, National Business Center, Acquisition Support Division, Southwest Branch, Second Floor, Building 22208, ATTN: BAA (J.

<SUBJECT>D -- NATO: Procurement and Implementation of Packet Transport  Components Nodes
<SOLNBR>CO-10040-PTC
<RESPDATE>061203
<ARCHDATE>06272003
<CONTACT>Alexis Kemper, International Trade Specialist, Phone 202-482-1512, Fax 202-482-5834, Email Alexis_Kemper@ita.doc.gov
<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) invites bids for the procurement and implementation of COTS NGCS Packet Transport Component (PTC) Nodes for the NATO General Purpose Communications Systems (NGCS) in various NATO locations.  A key component of the CP 5A0004/9B5016 and its future revision is the provision of resilient and secure Packed Mode Services integral to the NGCS.  This objective will be achieved via the evolution of NIDTS services, which have been operational since 1996, into a homogenous NATO Wide Area Network.  This, with associated Transmission, Network and Infosec components, will provide a reliable and efficient information exchange service for the expanding user community.

Within this context, the scope of the IFB is for the supply and implementation of NGCS  PTC Nodes (Packet Transport Component) at around 30 locations across all NATO nations.  The PTC Nodes will consist of COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) multi-service IP routing elements, switching elements and ancillary equipment with high capacity, high availability and resilience.  Also, within the scope are the supply and implementation of Network Management & Control Facilities, Training Facility, Reference Facility, Common Service Servers and WAN Probes.  The scope also includes provision of Technical Support Consultancy to NACOSA to support operation of the PTC network.

Provision of related transmission services and encryption devices are being handled via separate ongoing Contracts and are not part of this IFB.

General Requirements

Each NGCS PTC node will be a configuration Of IP routing and switching elements capable of high throughputs and providing high service availability with full redundancy and hot swap capabilities.  

Nodes will need to support a baseline of around 50 wide-area links, with additional expansion capability.  Currently wide-area links are protected by link encryption devices and the primary interface type required is V.35, but the nodes are also required to support E1, E3, Ethernet and ISDN interfaces.  Nodes will also be connected to local access routers or LANs over Ethernet, and will need to support high data throughput between local networks.

As well as supporting the current network architecture, the PTC nodes also need to support the approved future NGCS network architecture, in which security protection is provided by IP cryptographic devices instead of link encryption devices.  Inthis architecture the wide area interface will be directly to a Bandwidth Management device via ATM, and the nodes need to support this future way of working.

The PTC nodes will be supported by comprehensive network management facilities with centralized policy enforcement and service management , which will be supplied as part of this project.  These facilities will be implemented in accordance with the current NACOSA Concept of Operations, which calls for an Operational Center in Belgium and a hot-standby in United Kingdaom wiht remote clients at Naples, Brunssum and Norfolk. 

The Project Scope also includes provision of a Training Facility at NATO School in Latina, a Reference Facility at NACOSA (Casteau), Common Service Servers at three locations, WAN Probes at eight locations.

The IFB package will not contain material of a classified nature.  However, contractor personnel working on NATO site will be required to have security clearances to the level of NATO SECRET which must be in place prior to contract award.

All potential bidders must be certified by the U. S. Department of Commerce, Office of Telecommunication Technologies.  Submit all requests to be nominated to Alexis Kemper (fax: 202-482-5834) by COB 12 June 2003.

<DESC>In the months following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Transportation Review Board (TRB) jointly conducted a security and emergency response survey of all State DOTs to help them assess vulnerability and preparedness.  The results of this survey indicated that 59% of the respondents had some surveillance capabilities on their bridges.  In order to better secure our structures, this number needs to be increased and the type of surveillance technologies upgraded.  The States are also overwhelmed by new technologies available for implementation, but lack the appropriate guidelines for choosing the technologies that will effectively secure our bridges and tunnels against terrorism.  The State transportation agencies and other private bridge operators (e.g. railroads) are seeking a menu of options for increasing surveillance and security of vulnerable structures.  The State highway agencies need better information on cost, effectiveness, design and applicability of state of the art technologies such as closed circuit cameras, electronic detection, monitoring, tracking and alarm systems, or security patrols.

The AASHTO Task Force on Transportation Security identified the need for this research as a priority.   It is also a step towards meeting FHWA’s goals to ensure the security of the transportation system for the movement of people and goods and of improving highway safety.  In order to assist the states and meet the goals, the Federal Highway Administration is initiating a national pooled fund study to identify state of the art surveillance and security technologies for bridges and tunnels.  

The state of the art technologies for bridge and tunnel surveillance identified in this study should assist the States in decision making and provide guidelines to determine the benefits of new technologies with the ultimate goal of improving the existing level of security.

The Government anticipates issuing a solicitation on or about 8 May 2003 by posting it on the website, www.fedbizopps.gov.  No written, telephone, facsimile or e-mail requests for the solicitation package will be accepted.  The proposal due date will be 30 days after the solicitation is posted.  The estimated award date is 10 Jul 2003.  Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it will be the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FedBizOpps website for both the solicitation and any solicitation amendments that may be issued.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida, intends to conduct a limited competition between Bell Avon, Inc. of Picayune, MS and B/E Aerospace-SMR Technologies, Inc. of Fenwick, WV to award a firm fixed price contract to manufacture two (2) LCAC Deep Skirt Systems.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has conducted a qualification program for manufacturers fabricating LCAC flexible skirt systems. These manufacturers were qualified in accordance with Government document No. 802-6336529, LANDING CRAFT, AIR CUSHION, PROJECT PECULIAR DOCUMENT, SKIRT MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS AND REQUIREMENTS DATED 01 APRIL, 1996, Revision C and document No. 802-6336530, LANDING CRAFT, AIR CUSHION, PROJECT PECULIAR DOCUMENT, SKIRT FABRICATION PROCEDURES date d 01 April, 1996, Revision B.  To date only Bell Avon, Inc. and B/E Aerospace-SMR Technologies have been certified as capable of providing the required LCAC flexible skirt systems.  As such these are the only two firms capable of competing for this requirement.  Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

<CONTACT>Elaine Flick Contracting Officer 3032363528     Elaine_Flick@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Alaska State Office has a requirement for a follow-on service contract for the operation and maintenance of the Alaska Meteor Burst Communications Master Station (AMBCS/MS) located at the BLM Campbell Tract Facility, at 6881 Abbott Loop Road, in Anchorage, Alaska.  Due to the importance of the AMBCS/MS, the contractor responsible for the operation and maintenance of this complicated system must have the capacity to restore the system to full and proper operational condition immediately subsequent to any system failure. In order to accomplish this level of performance, the contractor must have experience and a thorough working knowledge of the system. The contractor must be an expert in meteor burst communications technology, with particular knowledge in AMBCS.  The contractor who is responsible for the operation and maintenance of this critical system must have the capacity to restore the system to full and proper operation within a very short period of time subsequent to any system failure.  To accomplish this level of performance, the contractor must have intimate, detailed knowledge of the entire system.  The contractor must be expert in meteor burst communications technology in general, and AMBCS in particular.  Micro Specialties has been involved with AMBCS/MS since its inception in the late 1970s, has operated and maintained AMBCS/MS for a number of years, and has worked with a number of other meteor burst systems in Alaska and elsewhere.  Micro Specialties has provided proprietary software, which is critical to the operation of the AMBCS/MS and the communication between the master station and its remote nodes.  Intimate knowledge of, and the ability to modify this software are critical to successful and timely restoration of system failures as well as adaptation of software to meet Government requirements.  This software source code cannot be made available to other vendors or potential contractors, and this service contract will therefore be awarded, sole source, to Micro Specialties.  For the above-sated reasons, the circumstances permitting other than full and open competition as cited in 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(2), and FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" are germane to this procurement.  This statutory authority applies, as a follow-on contract awarded to anyone other than Micro Specialties would result in substantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  As such, the BLM intends to award a firm-fixed price services contract to Micro Specialties for the follow-on effort described above.  Questions regarding this procurement may be directed to Elaine E. Flick, the Contracting Officer, at 303-236-3528.  See Note 22!

Historically Black Colleges, Universities and Minority Institutions (HBCU/MI) continue to play a significant role in the education of minorities, make outstanding intellectual and scientific contributions that are indispensable to the broader society, and serves as centers for ethic and minority culture.  These institutions, however, have experienced difficulties in winning grants and contracts as a result of competitively issued Request for Proposals (RFP's) for Research and Development Requirements (R&D) from the Federal and State Governments and in many cases the private sector as well.  During the 1990s HBCU/MI's comprised approximately 12.7 percent of all U.S. Institutions conducting research and development, yet they receive less than 1.5 percent of the research dollars awarded to institutions of higher educations.  Chaminade University is the only known source to NCI that can provide the necessary services required by the Agency.  Chaminade University will provide all services/materials required to host a three day workshop from a variety of Minority Institution's primarily from the Pacific Basin-servicing areas including Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam and the commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands.  This is not a soclitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above services, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be in writing and received in the contracting office by 2:00 PM EST on June 9, 2003.  For further information please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, 301-402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collects calls will be accepted.  NAICS Code 611710.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The RESPONSE DATE EXTENDED TO June 19, 2003.  This procurement is anticipated to be a Sole Source Contract with the Intelligent Transportation Society of America, located in Washington DC.  In the Request For Proposals (RFP) the FHWA will be seeking a proposal for work entitled: “Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Program Office Program Support.” It is anticipated that the award will be an ID/IQ task order contract, and that each task order issued will be Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee.  It is estimated that the resulting contract will have an 18 month base period, and two option years. Telephoned, E-Mailed, Faxed, or Letter Requests for the RFP Will Not Be Accepted.  All prospective offerors need to obtain the RFP from FedBizOpps, at http://www.eps.gov.  Any subsequent RFP Amendments will be published in FedBizOpps. FHWA does not plan to mail out any HARD copies of any Amendments. Therefore, it shall be the responsibility of each offeror to closely and frequently monitor FedBizOpps for any Amendments to the RFP.  The due date for the FHWA’s receipt of proposals will be stated in the RFP.

The objective of this contract is to provide support services to the ITSJPO in the conduct of the ITS program as authorized under the TEA-21 (Public Law 105-178).

Congress, under The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century ( TEA-21, Public law 105-178), section 5201,  finds that “continue investment in architecture and standards development, research, and systems integration as necessary to accelerate the rate at which intelligent transportation system program  are incorporated into the national surface transportation  network, thereby improving transportation safety and efficiency and reducing costs and negative impacts on communities and the environment.”

In carrying out the provisions of this subtitle, section 5204 of TEA-21 mandates the  Secretary to conduct an ongoing intelligent transportation system program to research, develop, and advance nationwide deployment of such systems in cooperation with State and local governments and others, including public and private entities . 

Accordingly, The Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITSJPO) has been working with Intelligent Transportation Society of America (ITSA), to support ITSJPO’s current and future responsibilities, including surface transportation management and operations, for  over 10 years through a cooperative agreement.  With the maturity of the ITS program, the ITSJPO requires the assistance of ITSA in a variety of program functions as a result of  its unique membership, access to ITS industry, and the intricate knowledge base of its staff.  This contract will provide specific services and supplies, through the issuance of  Cost Plus Fixed Fee task orders on an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) basis.  

NO  PRE-PROPOSAL  CONFERENCE:  The FHWA does not plan to conduct any pre-proposal conference for prospective offerors, but see the following paragraphs, for the procedure for asking questions about this solicitation.   

NO  ORAL  PRESENTATIONS:  The FHWA has decided that the oral presentations method will not be used in this procurement.  However, any offeror whose initial proposal is found to be within the competitive range, and who does not receive an award without discussion, will be asked to participate in a negotiation session which would include an oral discussion of all technical issues and all cost-and-pricing issues pertaining to that offeror’s proposal.

<CONTACT>Cheryl Robertson, Contract Specialist, Phone (202)366-4004, Fax (202)366-3705, Email cheryl.robertson@fhwa.dot.gov
<DESC>In the months following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the Transportation Review Board (TRB) jointly conducted a security and emergency response survey of all State DOTs to help them assess vulnerability and preparedness.  The results of this survey indicated that 59% of the respondents had some surveillance capabilities on their bridges.  In order to better secure our structures, this number needs to be increased and the type of surveillance technologies upgraded.  The States are also overwhelmed by new technologies available for implementation, but lack the appropriate guidelines for choosing the technologies that will effectively secure our bridges and tunnels against terrorism.  The State transportation agencies and other private bridge operators (e.g. railroads) are seeking a menu of options for increasing surveillance and security of vulnerable structures.  The State highway agencies need better information on cost, effectiveness, design and applicability of state of the art technologies such as closed circuit cameras, electronic detection, monitoring, tracking and alarm systems, or security patrols.

The AASHTO Task Force on Transportation Security identified the need for this research as a priority.   It is also a step towards meeting FHWA’s goals to ensure the security of the transportation system for the movement of people and goods and of improving highway safety.  In order to assist the states and meet the goals, the Federal Highway Administration is initiating a national pooled fund study to identify state of the art surveillance and security technologies for bridges and tunnels.  

The state of the art technologies for bridge and tunnel surveillance identified in this study should assist the States in decision making and provide guidelines to determine the benefits of new technologies with the ultimate goal of improving the existing level of security.  The FHWA anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract with a 12 month period of performance.  This requirement is considered a 100% small business set-aside pursuant to NAICS code 541690.

The Government anticipates issuing a solicitation on or about 8 May 2003 by posting it on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) website, http://www.eps.gov.  No written, telephone, facsimile or e-mail requests for the solicitation package will be accepted.  The proposal due date will be 30 days after the solicitation is posted.  The estimated award date is 10 Jul 2003.  Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it will be the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the EPS website for both the solicitation and any solicitation amendments that may be issued.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested at this time and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, DTSA20-03-Q-00942 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-13.  This requirement is set-aside for small businesses.   The associated NAICS code is 3261 Plastics Product Manufacturing and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  Congress, through the Aviation and Transportation Security Act signed by the President November 19, 2001, requires the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to implement 100 percent screening of checked baggage.  To be successful, TSA must have the ability to open for inspection 100% of baggage.  Because airports have mixed baggage populations (screened and unscreened) it has been determined that there is a need for a TSA “Cleared Sticker”.  The Cleared Sticker will be used by the screeners and the baggage handlers to differentiate bags that have or have not been screened.  THE LINE ITEMS ARE AS FOLLOW:  0001 – TSA Cleared Stickers, QTY = 220,000,000 EACH.  CLIN DESCRIPTIONS- 0001 – TSA “Cleared Baggage” Stickers shall be produced in up to seven colors, which may include red, blue, green, yellow, orange, purple and teal. The vendor shall modify this design when instructed by TSA based on experience and field-testing.  These designs may be changed as often as once every 30 days.  The Cleared Stickers shall be ¾ inches – 1 inch diameter round pressure-sensitive high-security labels.  Material: "Destruct", frangible material.  Adhesive: Permanent for use on thermal coated baggage tags.  Static imprint: Security Holographic TSA logo (or other approved design) in center.  Imprint: Consecutive alphanumeric numbering (3-letter individual airport code plus 7 digits).

<DESC>MODIFICATION No. 2. This modification replaces previous announcement HQ0006-03-0-0000 posted on 5 May 2003, and Modification No. 1 posted on 29 May 2003. In January 2002, the Secretary of Defense directed the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) provide the US, its allies, deployed forces, and friends with a layered ballistic missile defense system. This ballistic missile defense system defeats missiles of all ranges and in all phases of flight. The Director, MDA, took the Secretary?s direction and tasked the Kinetic Energy Interceptors Program Office to develop a program yielding a kinetic boost/ascent phase capability against Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles and Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles as soon as practical. The Director further requested a competitive program rapidly delivering capabilities to the BMDS test bed. The existing program strategy consists of two major efforts. We plan to use a capability-based acquisition with the goal of determining what capability can be delivered, when. Contracts were recently awarded to two teams for the definition of a mobile, terrestrially based, boost/ascent test bed element. The contractors? efforts focus on delivering as early as Block 08 (January 2008-December 2009). The second element invests in the development of a space-based interceptor test bed. The Kinetic Energy Interceptors Program Office seeks information regarding industry?s ability to design, develop, and implement a space based test bed for ballistic missile defense interceptors. Industry responses to this RFI will be used to develop the Government?s acquisition approach. We envision a strategy resulting in a best value acquisition with full and open competition. Information desired at this time: 1. Executive Summary: 1.1 What type of program planning and strategy would you propose? 1.2 What is your proposed technical approach? 1.3 What is your proposed business approach? 2. Describe a recommended approach to design, develop and implement a space based test bed focused initially on ground-based risk reduction (targeted at concept functionality and miniaturization): 2.1 What is the general design concept? 2.2 What is the basic functionality required in a space based test bed? What is the key functionality required to enable an operational capability? 2.3 How would you allocate those functions within and between the different element segments (space and ground)? 2.4 What is ground operations concept? 2.5  What critical space-based interceptor functionality can be demonstrated in ground-based testing?  What will remain for space demonstration?   2.6 How would your ground-based, risk reduction program benefit both space and terrestrial based missile defense? 2.7 What is the enabling technology for a space based test bed? What are the key space and ground segment technologies you would initially focus on? 2.8 What level of element/component miniaturization and any associated performance increase can be achieved as a function over time?  2.9 What is the necessary ground-based, risk reduction program required to bring these key technologies to an appropriate technology and engineering manufacturing readiness level? 2.10 What is the spiral development path of a space based test bed? What advances are required for each spiral? 3. Describe a high confidence risk reduction, development and test schedule of production representative (stable configuration, built in a manufacturing facility by manufacturing personnel) space based interceptors for test: 3.1 What are the key development milestones and tests necessary to build and test a production element? When do these events occur? 3.2 What is the necessary flight test progression to produce three intercepts with production representative interceptors? 3.3 What test and evaluation assets and infrastructure are needed to support the development and operation of a space test bed? 3.4 What are the key production processes that you plan to employ? 3.5 What processes should be used to ensure mission success? 4. Identify Production Off-ramp Opportunities: 4.1 What is your operational concept? 4.2 How can you trace your test bed concept to an operational concept? 4.3 What is the schedule for producing and deploying an operational concept? 4.4 What is your launch segment concept? 4.5 What is the boost/ascent performance of your operational concept against ballistic missiles of various types and ranges? 4.6 What is the inherent midcourse capability of an operational concept? 4.7 What Ballistic Missile Defense System sensor (s) and/or Command and Control, Battle Management and Communication capabilities are required to enable your approach? 5. Contact information: 5.1 Company name, address and primary engineering and program management points-of-contact with name, phone number and email address. 5.2 Provide a brief description of current and/or previous spacecraft and ballistic missile defense interceptor development experience. If you have questions related to this RFI, please contact Mr. Fred Renz, frederick.renz@bmdo.osd.mil. The Program Office will respond individually to each request. Your response to the RFI should be received at MDA no later than 4:00 PM EDT, 20 June 2003. The Program Office will conduct an Industry Day regarding a potential procurement in August 2003. The Government may elect to conduct one-on-one meetings as necessary with respondents to obtain further clarification on the proposed approach.  Instructions for responses: You may submit your response, not to exceed 25 pages or 50-scripted power point charts, either electronically (soft copy) or physically (hard copy). Proprietary information may be submitted; however, industry is advised that restrictions that inhibit the Government?s ability to disclose the information within the Missile Defense Agency may preclude us from considering that information in developing the acquisition approach. Information submitted by industry will be reviewed by MDA, support contractor personnel. Personnel from the following firms will be involved in the review: Millennium Engineering and Integration Modern Technology Solutions, Incorporated Andrulius Corporation. In addition, Representatives from the Missile Defense National Team Agreements (Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed-Martin, Northrop-Grumman and Raytheon) may be involved in reviewing this RFI.  Unless clearly marked otherwise, submission of a response to this RFI signifies agreement to allow personnel from the above-listed firms and from MDA to use the information to develop the acquisition approach. Technical Point of Contact: Mr. Richard S. Matlock Richard.Matlock@bmdo.osd.mil 703 695-6637 MDA/KI Failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future competition, nor will information provided in response to this RFI be used to exclude anyone from responding to any future Request for Proposals. THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT TO ULTIMATELY ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR AWARD A CONTRACT. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.

<DESC>CLARIFICATION:    The Library of Congress solicitation, RFP#S-LC03013, for Information Retrieval services for the FEDLINK Program offers customers two service options for contracting with FEDLINK vendors which are as follows:   (1) RFP section F.2.2(a)  Direct-Pay.  Under the direct pay option, customers send their agency generated purchase order directly to the vendor.  An interagency agreement between the customer and LC is not required and the customer does not pay the FEDLINK administrative fee.  The vendor provides service, invoices the customer directly against the agency purchase order, and the vendor pays the FEDLINK administrative fee.  Direct-pay processes are described in detail in section F.3 of the RFP.   (2) RFP section F.2.2(b)  Transfer-Pay.  Under the transfer pay option, a customer transfers both FEDLINK administrative fees and estimated annual service dollars to LC via a signed interagency agreement or other LC-approved customer agency document authorizing the transfer of funds to LC.  On behalf of the customer, LC/Contracts issues a delivery order to the vendor in the amount specified on the interagency agreement or funds transfer document.  After receiving the delivery order, the vendor provides service to the customer and submits the customer's invoices to FEDLINK.  FEDLINK reviews the invoices, rejects improper ones, and pays acceptable ones from the customer's account.  Transfer pay processes are described in detail in section F.4 of the RFP.   THE TRANSFER PAY OPTION IS REQUIRED under this solicitation; all vendors responding to this solicitation must offer the Transfer Pay option.  The Direct Pay option may be offered in addition to the Transfer Pay option but is not mandatory.  Vendors shall NOT offer the Direct Pay option only.

<DESC>Amendment 2 has been issued for this statement of interest which  replaces the NAICS code.  The new NAICS code for this is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services (500 employees).

CH2M HILL Hanford Group, Inc. (CH2M HILL) in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Tank Farm Contract, is soliciting interest and information from qualified firms having the capability of performing analytical services (laboratory management; inorganic, organic and radiochemical analyses; methods development and process troubleshooting) for the analysis of radioactive and/or hazardous waste samples.  The DOE has announced the pending transfer of the 222-S Laboratory to CH2M HILL, the primary user of the Laboratory’s analytical services.  In addition to supporting CH2M HILL, the Laboratory provides site-wide analytical services for the Hanford site.  CH2M HILL is interested in contracting with a nationally recognized laboratory organization to gain commercial efficiencies in operations. 

This will be a local business preference solicitation. To be considered local, interested parties must be operating in the local vicinity of the Hanford site for the duration of any resulting contract.  For interested parties not presently operating within the local vicinity, but plan to respond to the proposed solicitation, sufficient details showing such planning so as to be fully operational at the time of contract award (September 2003) shall be required to be submitted with their proposal.   

Further it is the intent of CH2M HILL to provide the maximum practical opportunity for small businesses to participate in contract performance.  Therefore, small businesses, small women-owned businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and small service-disabled businesses are encouraged to apply and/or participate in teaming agreements to participate in contract performance.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for determining size status is 541380.     

Interested parties are hereby requested to review and provide comments on the information provided herein.  Closing date for this RFI is May 14, 2003. An informational session on the existing analytical services will be conducted on April 24, 2003.  Tour schedules of the facility will be announced at the meeting. Participants will be advised where to meet for the tour.  The tour will be restricted to two individuals for each firm who will participate.  A draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is anticipated to be released on or about June 18, 2003.  There will be a second tour conducted after the draft RFP has been issued for those parties who wish to attend.


CH2M HILL is requesting interest and information on 3 options for analytical services:
1.	Management and direction of the 222-S Analytical Laboratory on the Hanford site that is being transferred to CH2M HILL, as a member of the CH2M HILL team.
2.	Becoming an approved subcontractor to CH2M HILL in charge of the analytical services scope performing the analyses for CH2M HILL including absorbing the current equipment and staff (augmented as appropriate) into the subcontract organization to complete the necessary scope.
3.	Performing some or all of the analytical services scope at offsite operations 

The successful Contractor shall be required to accept the Labor Agreement in place with the Hanford Atomic Metal Trade Council (HAMTC-AFL-CIO) at the time of contract award. The terms of this Labor Agreement will be applicable to these employees until the Contractor executes a new labor contract with HAMTC.  The successful Contractor will be required to offer employment to transferring HAMTC represented personnel.  These bargaining unit employees will become employees of the Contractor as of the effective date of the Contract for Options 2 and 3.  Any grievances/arbitrations occurring after the start of this work shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.  The number of personnel, craft specialties, wage rates, etc. will be made available in the draft RFP.

The successful Contractor will be expected to consider offering positions to the existing exempt and non-exempt staff.  The number of exempt and non-exempt personnel and their specialties will be made available in the draft RFP.

The existing equipment and instrumentation located in the 222-S Laboratory will be made available to the Contractor for Options 1 and 2, provided it is deemed suitable for release under Government and CH2M HILL procedures.  Equipment and instrumentation that can be made available and is deemed suitable for use by the Contractor will be made available for use at no additional cost to the Contractor. 

The successful Contractor shall be required to give priority to CH2M HILL’s and other Hanford site contractors’ analytical services requirements. The total annual volume of analytical services work is estimated to be $30M with currently around 25,000 analyses consisting of 20% organic analyses (PCB, VOA, SVOA), 30% radiochemistry and 50% inorganic analyses (primarily metals). Additional analytical service needs and equipment in support of the Office of River Protection Project may become a part of the final Request for Proposal. 

The successful Contractor must comply with the following codes, standards and other requirements as specified within task orders as well as applicable Federal, State and local laws, licensing and regulations: 

·	A Quality Assurance Program based on voluntary national consensus standards such as the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program (NELAP), NQA-1 etc. and meeting the requirements of Code of Federal Regulations 10 CFR 830, Nuclear Safety Management, Subpart A, Quality Assurance and the Hanford site’s analytical quality requirements document, HASQARD.
·	A Safety Management Program designed to ensure the facility is operated in a manner that adequately protects workers, the public, and the environment, and consistent with 48 CFR 970.5223-1, “Integration of environmental, safety and health into work planning and execution”. 
·	OSHA 1910.1450 
·	Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)

<DESC>Questions and Answers For the Installation of Lights, Radios, Sirens and Associated Parts.

This modification is to answer questions, received for solicitation Number USS0300031 and to amend line item 0006.  

Line Item 0006 is amended to delete, “Mount Siren Speaker in front of vehicle (hidden) in a manner, which allows maximum sound projection to the front of the vehicle”.

1.)  Question:

What is the make and model of the 20” and the 12” Light Sticks, The USSS is supplying for these vehicles? Number of Conductors in the cable?

Answer:

Reference Line item 0002 of the solicitation:  “All equipment needed for line item 0001 installations including, but not limited to, (490) 20” LED light sticks”.  The number of conductors in the cable is solely at the discretion of the contractor and dependent upon the type of lights offered.

2.)  Question:

The IFB requires water tight quick disconnects for the Light Sticks.  Please specify a make and model of connector desired?

Answer:

The make and model of the connectors is dependent upon the type of watertight quick disconnects offered by the contractor.

3.)  Question:

Are there any Lights, Sirens, Radios or Antennas that will need to be provided by the Vendor?

Answer:

As indicated in the solicitation; “The USSS will provide Radios, Sirens, Siren Speakers, relays for siren/horn operation, plywood mounting boards, fused leads and components relating to the installation of the Radios and Sirens.  The USSS will provide antennas and connectors”.  Reference Question #1 for the supply of the LED light sticks. 

4.)  Question: Does the vendor need to provide the location for the installation or will there be a building at your location to conduct the installation? 

Answer:

As listed in the Solicitation; “All work will be performed at the USSS facility in the Laurel/Beltsville area of Maryland”.


5.)  Question:  In the USSS0300031 bid it doesn’t specify if the contractor provides all the lights needed or does the USSS provide some? 

Answer:

Reference Question #1.

 
6.)  Question:  Does the aforementioned solicitation require installation of armor plating? 

 
Answer:

No.

7.)  Question:  Could you provide any additional information, formal bid packet or any related material that would assist us in successfully completing the bid process?

Answer:  No.  In reference to the solicitation, “This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued”.

8.)  Question:  Because the bid requires work to be performed at Beltsville in provided facilities, I would like to visit there to see the space that is available for my staff to work at.  Would I have to schedule overtime and weekend work?

Answer:  A site visit will not be possible.  The work area consists of four (4) Bays, approximately 15 Ft by 25 Ft.  As stated in the solicitation, “It is the contractor’s responsibility to schedule work in order to complete all installations by August 1, 2003”.

<DESC>NA The Northern Region Contracting Center, Mission Support Division, Fort Leavenworth, KS, is seeking sources among GSA schedule contractors.  The service requested is analytical support for the Army Transformation Concept Development and Experimentation Prog ram (AT-CDEP) and American, British, Canadian and Australian (ABCA) Armies Interoperability Exercise Program.  The vendor must have operational experience with Objective Force concepts within battle command scenarios.  Specifically, the vendorÃ¢Â€Â™s opera tional experience should include:  1) at least two years of objective force battle command concept and implementation experience; 2) experience in planning and coordinating objective force battle command experiments and actual participation in at least one  objective force battle command experiment that included human-in-the-loop role players, C2 devices, and an objective force federation of models; 3) experience in coalition planning to include on site participation with any of the ABCA nations, and 4) at l east one year of experience with objective force scenario development.   This project is a continuation of the Analytic Support for the Command and Control, Communications, Computers Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Modeling and Analys is Working Group (MAWG) Program.  In the C4ISR experiment, the aim was to see how C4ISR impacted the unit of action (UA) commander's ability to command and control his unit.  The contractor was Booz-Allen and Hamilton.  The current requirement, Army Transf ormation Concept Development and Experimentation Program (AT-CDEP), addresses the human-in-the-loop (HITL) process.  The human inter-action required for interface with the  model and/or simulation.  This means a willful, decision-processed action must occu r before the simulation can proceed.  Typically, the HITL process includes battle command decisions; applying the art of war more than the science.  Responsibilities include perform tasks associated with the development and management of the analysis porti on of the Army Transformation Concept Development and Experimentation Program (AT-CDEP).  Tasks include developing and coordinating the analysis plan to ensure synchronization with TRADOCÃ¢Â€Â™s experiment plan and to ensure level of analytic rigor that is  planned can support required transformation decisions.  The deliverable is an analysis annex to the AT-CDEP.   Perform tasks associated with the development, management and execution of the Integrated Study Plan (ISP) in support of Army experimentation. Develop and coordinate the ISP with TRADOC staff and subordinate battle labs to ensure a synchronous body of analysis is produced from several experiment venues.  Deliverable is the ISP and its continuous refinement.  Conduct scenario development in suppor t of Army and joint experimentation integrating events.  Develop scenarios that will support experimental events in FY04 and coordinate with multiple TRADOC battle labs to ensure consistency among different experiment venues.  Deliverable is a scenario tha t will support FY04 experimental events.   Provide support to develop and manage a database management tool that harvests, stores, and disseminates critical analytic insights that underpin objective force requirements.  Provide developmental and analytic s upport to the Australian British Canadian American (ABCA) cooperative interoperability experiments that will take place June 2004.  This task requires review and de-confliction of four separate nationsÃ¢Â€Â™ analysis and data collection plans in order to e nable sufficient resources for exercise execution.   Provide planning and execution support, to the Army Transformation Exercise 2004 (ATEX04) that will take place September 2004.  The complete requirements are included in the Statement of Work (SOW).  The  Federal Supply Classification (FSC) code for this project is R421, NAICS code is 541519, and SIC code is 7379.  If no responsive/responsible replies are receiv ed, an order will be negotiated with Booz-Allen and Hamilton under GSA contract GS-35F-0306J for these services.  All responses will be considered and must include proof of the ability to provide analytical support for the Army Transformation Concept Devel opment and Experimentation Program (AT-CDEP) and American, British, Canadian and Australian (ABCA) Armies Interoperability Exercise Program including performance information and references on the contractorÃ¢Â€Â™s abilities.  The response should also provi de GSA schedule, contract labor categories and rates for this service.   All responses must include company name, address, POC, phone number, fax number, email address, business size, taxpayer identification number, DUNS number and CAGE code.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential sources to privatize the electrical, natural gas, water and wastewater infrastructure systems at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, New York. The station occupies approximately 985 acres on the northern part of the Niagara Falls International Airport in Niagara County New York. The 914th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve is the host unit at Niagara Falls ARS. The 107th Air Refueling Wing of the New York Air National Guard is the largest tenant. The station has expanded several times and currently has 107 buildings (industrial and commercial type buildings). In addition, the station has Visiting Officer Quarters but no permanent on-base military family housing. The electrical distribution system is supplied power by Niagara-Mohawk Power Corporation by two separate feeds. The 914th Airlift Wing is supplied by a 13.2 kV electrical line that enters the base on the north side. The 107th Air Refueling wing is supplied by a 13.2 kV electrical supply line that enters the base on the west side. Each Air Wing has its own electrical distribution system, but they are connected by a switch that is locked in the open position. The electrical distribution system for the 914th portion of the base consists of approximately 24,400 feet of new overhead primary line and 2200 feet of overhead secondary line. The electrical distribution system for the 107th portion of the base consists of approximately 5,100 linear feet of underground primary line and 500 feet of underground secondary line. Pole mounted and pad mounted transformers of various sizes are used throughout the system. The electrical system supports approximately 130 outside area lights. The water distribution system is supplied by the City of Niagara Falls, New York. Water is distributed throughout the base in approximately 48,300 linear feet of cast iron, transite, and PVC water mains. Sizes range up to 10 inches in diameter. A pump station, located approximately one quarter mile south of the southeast corner of the base boosts pressure. The water system also includes approximately 88 fire hydrants. The town of Wheatfield provides an emergency water source to the water system through a clay valve that releases if pressure in the base system drops to an unacceptable level. The natural gas distribution system is supplied by National Fuel Gas Company at two locations. Natural Gas for the 914th Air Wing is fed by a line that enters on the north side of the base. Natural gas for the 107th Air Refueling Wing is fed from the west side of the base. Approximately 25,000 feet of steel and plastic pipe make up the gas distribution system for the 914th Air Wing. Approximately 6,800 linear feet of steel and plastic line make up the natural gas distribution system. The wastewater system is discharged to the Niagara County Sewage District No.1 sewer system east of the base. The Niagara Falls wastewater collection system includes approximately 36,600 linear feet of pipe (ductile iron, reinforced concrete and PVC). Sizes range from 4 inch to 12 inch. The wastewater collection system is a combination of gravity flow and forced main and includes 3 pump stations. The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right of Way as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  At this time, no solicitation exists: therefore, DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION.

(CH2M HILL) in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Tank Farm Contract, is soliciting interest and information from qualified firms having the capability of performing analytical services (laboratory management; inorganic, organic and radiochemical analyses; methods development and process troubleshooting) for the analysis of radioactive and/or hazardous waste samples.  The DOE has announced the pending transfer of the 222-S Laboratory to CH2M HILL, the primary user of the Laboratory’s analytical services.  In addition to supporting CH2M HILL, the Laboratory provides site-wide analytical services for the Hanford site.  CH2M HILL is interested in contracting with a nationally recognized laboratory organization to gain commercial efficiencies in operations. 

This will be a local business preference solicitation. To be considered local, interested parties must be operating in the local vicinity of the Hanford site for the duration of any resulting contract.  For interested parties not presently operating within the local vicinity, but plan to respond to the proposed solicitation, sufficient details showing such planning so as to be fully operational at the time of contract award (September 2003) shall be required to be submitted with their proposal.   

Further it is the intent of CH2M HILL to provide the maximum practical opportunity for small businesses to participate in contract performance.  Therefore, small businesses, small women-owned businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and small service-disabled businesses are encouraged to apply and/or participate in teaming agreements to participate in contract performance.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for determining size status is 541380.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-TIRNO-A76-SeatManagement
<RESPDATE>061703

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is seeking sources for a Seat Management Services A-76 Competitive Sourcing Study.  This pilot program presents a variety of service environments, including locations with a high concentration of customers and few mobile users and other locations which will require the majority of support for mobile and off site customers.  The service delivery timeframes will depend on the priority of the trouble ticket as listed out in the Corporate Problem Solving Guide IRM.2.14.2 (see below listed web site for specific details).  The web will also provide a description of the customer segments, required support hours, as well as the location of those customers. 

This is not an end-to-end effort.  The service provider shall provide support for approximately 15,000 seats in the service area (35% of the seats have laptops and 65% of the seats have desktops).  At present approximately 40% of the total computer stock is 400 MHz or below, but will decline as equipment is refreshed.  Services include desktop support, asset management,  applications touchpoint (warm hand off from Help Desk to subject matter experts for application support), performance evaluation, and establishment and staffing of a help desk. Desktop hardware includes, desktops, laptops, docking stations, monitors, printers and other desktop peripherals (e.g., scanners, zip drives, desktop video camera).  Support will also include the non-LAN/Server functions for security operations, database management/administration and configuration management. Service Provider must have the potential to compete in a potential follow competition for providing seat management services for all IRS locations, which is approximately an additional 100,000 seats.  

Desktop Support:  Desktop support comprises performance of technical activities for client computers and peripherals including desk-side support and problem resolution, user administration(moves, adds and changes to users), operating system support, maintenance labor, software deployment, hardware configuration/re-configuration, hardware deployment, and seat management support for hardware and software.  Software support includes supporting IRS Common Operating Environment (COE) which includes but is not limited to the most current version of: Adobe Acrobat, Advance Checker, Attachmate Infoconnect Millennium II, Exceed, Interix, Internet Explorer, Windows media Player, Microsoft Office, Access, Binder Outlook, Excel Photo Editor, Publisher ,and Snapshot Viewer. 

Asset management:  The service provider will be responsible for recording acquisitions, deletions, moves, and changes of IT components including asset identification and tracking, asset database management, change recording, and reconciliation. 

Help Desk:  Help Desk requirements include applications touchpoint, the screening of tickets and calls, diagnosis of customer problem and problem resolution.  Problem resolution may include assignment to service provider or utilization of other assets such as warranty or maintenance contracts.  

Other considerations:  This pilot effort spans three IRS territories (geographically centered around Detroit, Kansas City and Chicago).  The territories are comprised of approximately 200 office locations located 16 states.  There are mobile users in each of the 200 office locations.  The web site referenced below will provide the office locations. The tax-processing mission will require a service provider to have the ability to adapt to cyclical (surge) workload situations.  For the Service Center, during the filing season, the number of seats could increase by approximately 2000.  For all other surge activities the number of desktops would not necessarily increase but the service delivery standard for providing support would be elevated and hours of support will increase.  

The objective of this RFI is to obtain capabilities statements, based upon the requirements outlined above, from all (large and small) businesses interested in this opportunity. Contractors should identify any information they consider to be sensitive or proprietary.  Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside, restrict competition in some way or solicit offers from all responsible sources. Identify your interest in either being a Prime or Subcontractor for this requirement. Should the procurement be set-aside for small business, FAR clause 52.219-14 “Limitations on Subcontracting ” (DEC 1996) will apply. A small businesses interested in bidding as a prime contractor under a set-aside program must provide sufficient information to demonstrate that compliance with this requirement can be met. 

 All interested businesses are hereby invited to submit a capabilities statement of no more than ten pages (not including past performance information) to demonstrate their ability to provide the services outlined above. The capabilities statement should be tailored to this request and identify the source’s capabilities to complete the requirements listed above, including information on key staff experience and a description of corporate experience with similar projects of like size and complexity, including the number of seats per location where the service was provided, and present and past performance information.  For each reference listed include the name of a contact person, telephone number and e-mail address.  In addition to addressing the requirements listed above respondents must provide information concerning gross revenue, number of employees in company, number of years in existence and primary focus of business.  

All employees need to be able to pass the IRS Minimum Background Investigation (MBI) requirements. In order for the IRS to assess acquisition strategy and set-aside possibilities, interested parties shall also include a cover letter that includes company name, points of contact, telephone numbers, fax numbers, e-mail addresses, prime or sub-contractor interest, and identifies the company as one or more of the following: 1) small business; 2) 8(a) business; 3) HUBZone small business; 4) small disadvantaged business; 5) woman-owned small business; (6) veteran-owned small business; (7) service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or (8) large business. Please note: This Sources Sought is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Response to the request will not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Address responses to: Internal Revenue Service, Tax Processing Systems Branch, A:P:I:S, Attn: Ms Donna M.

<SUBJECT>A-- Advanced Uncooled Infrared (UCIR) Focal Plane Array (FPA) Manufacturing Technology Research
<DESC>Technical POC: Dr. James C. Brown, CERDEC/NVESD; Contractual POC: Ms.Eileen Bradley (DOI/NBC). The Program Manager for the Advanced UCIR FPA Manufacturing Technology Improvement program will host an unclassified review of the program for interested representatives of Government and industry on Wednesday, 18 June 2003.  The briefing will be held from 9:00 to 12:00 in the NVESD S&T Conference Room in building 357, room 240 at Fort Belvoir, VA.  Directions, maps, and information on accommodations are available through the NVESD web site: http://www.nvl.army.mil/home.html.   The purpose of the UCIR FPA Manufacturing Technology Improvement Program is to addresses the development and refinement of the manufacturing processes for the advanced small pixel uncooled detector and associated calibration and vacuum packaging technologies. The detector and packaging tasks will address the needs for both the 320x240 and 640x480 arrays, with emphasis placed on the 640x480 array. The overall goal is to substantially reduce the cost and improve the availability of these UCIR FPAs for current and future Army applications in order to maintain US warfighter overmatch.

<SUBJECT>99 -- F61521-99-W-5065   Fuels O & M
<DESC>Description of Action:  Rhein Main Fuels Contract, Frankfurt, Germany:  Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the government intends to issue a modification to the current contract F61521-99-W-5065 for fuel services, written with Pacific Architect & Engineering (PAE) Inc., Los Angeles, CA, for a 15 months only contract extension from 01 Oct 04 through 31 Dec 05, for continued fuels services.  Current contract with PAE expires 30 Sep 04 and comprises contractor provided operation and maintenance of fuels facilities,  7 days a week fuel servicing and contingency support services.  At this time, it is projected that all air operations will cease on 30 Sep 05 and in the last calendar year quarter ending 31 Dec 05, the final close-down of the facilities and operation will take place, at which time the facilities will be turned over to the Federal Republic of Germany.  There is no current indication that the mission will require Rhein Main AB to remain open beyond 31 Dec 05.  This action is considered necessary to mitigate mission disruption and avoid unacceptable delays in fulfilling the government’s requirements and in the interests of cost effectiveness, by avoiding substantial duplication of costs to the Government that are not expected to be recovered through competition.  For information purposes, no logistics support is provided under this contract.
All interested and responsible sources may submit a response to the below POC not later than 17 Jun 03 which, if timely received, will be considered.

FACSIMILE: 202/685-5850 ATTN: SEALIFT, TANKERS PROGRAM

ADD PART V. CLAUSE (G): 
The Military Sealift Command has implemented a fully automated satellite tracking system (ASTARS) for the purpose of providing In-Transit Visibility (ITV) of its vessels.  To support this system MSC utilizes position data provided by a ship's INMARSAT-C Terminal (the terminal must have a GPS input). This is a critical requirement and is therefore mandatory. 

In order to initiate reporting and start receiving the required data from a ship, MSC needs to know the make and model of the vessel's  INMARSAT C terminal, its registered identification number, and the specific satellite (POR, AORE, AORW, or IOR) it is currently logged on to.  Once this information is received, MSC technicians will remotely communicate with the terminal to activate reporting.  When no longer required, MSC technicians will stop the terminal from reporting.  MSC technicians may require some assistance from ship's personnel should problems occur.  The ship's terminal will accrue a nominal cost associated with the sending of small data packets.

E. OFFERORS SHALL PROVIDE A CERTIFIED CREW LIST PRIOR TO AWARD AND NO LATER THAN 96 HOURS PRIOR TO DELIVERY OF THE VESSEL AT THE LOAD PORT.  A LIST OF ANY RELIEFS SCHEDULED ON THE VESSEL IS REQUIRED WITHIN 6 HOURS OF PERSONNEL CHANGE.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14. 

****The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is unrestricted and all responsible Parties may submit a quote.

****The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has a requirement for one (1) tunable, near infrared femtosecond (fs) laser system, including a pump and a Ti-Sapphire oscillator.  This laser will be used as part of a coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) system.  It will also be used in time-resolved macromolecular dynamics, and holographic grating experiments (the latter using the pump beam).  All interested parties shall provide a quote for the following line item:

****LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each Tunable, Near Infrared Femtosecond (fs) Laser System with the following required specifications:****Ability to precisely synchronize a second laser system in a ps – fs, or ps – ps, configuration; Synchronization for the system must be ± 250 fs or less; Low Noise.  Pulse-to-pulse power noise should be no more than 0.2%, over a period on the order of 100 ms. This corresponds to 0.2% noise in a bandwidth of 10 Hz to 80 MHz.; Repetition Rate of at least 76 MHz; Pulse Width- 90 fs at 780 nm; Average Output Power- 1.0 W; Separate CW cavity arm to facilitate alignment and to produce tunable CW output if desired; An auto ranging, five decade fluorescence detector/power meter to facilitate alignment and optimization; A monitor to verify CW spectral content to insure spectral integrity of output and maintain pure modelocked operation; A biased, fast photodiode to provide a synchronization signal for detector triggering; and On-Site installation at NIST*****Specifications for Reliability of Pump Laser*****The system performance must be impervious to humidity swings in the range of (15 to 80)% relative humidity, and temperature swings of ±5°C about a mean; The pump laser should be hermetically sealed so as to prevent dust and excess humidity from entering the cavity and so that no alignment or cleaning of optics is needed; Should include integrated diagnostics to maintain peak performance in the presence of humidity and temperature changes; Diode bar material should have no aluminum in the active area so as to eliminate damage due to oxidation of aluminum at the diode facet; The laser must be passively modelocked and use a variable saturable absorber for preferential control between CW and modelocked operation since this configuration provides a means for controlling loss differential as well as gain differential which is necessary for reliable operation and control of the spectral purity of the modelocked output; The system shall include a starter mechanism, which actively and reproducibly initiates modelocked operation. This system shall include a sensor to automatically restart the system should modelocked operation be interrupted.*****DELIVERY SHALL BE FOB DESTINATION.  The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.*****Award shall be made to the Party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered.
