<DESC>This is not a Request for Proposal.  DoDDS Pacific/DDESS Guam  is conducting a Market Research to determine if sources are available to provide Commercial Internet Access Services, and to determine how these services are provided in the commercial marketplace.  All potential sources are requested to provide background information on their company, means and ways that they provide Commercial Internet Services, prices offered to the general public and their Quality Control Plan to insure that services provided meet the customers needs.  All information provided by potential sources shall only be evaluated to determine the most efficient and effective method of obtaining Commercial Internet Access Services.  All information provided by potential sources shall be withheld for official use only and shall not be divulged to the general public.

DoDDS Pacific/DDESS Guam is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for Commercial Inernet Access Services.  The contractor shall provide all services, labor, materials, and equipment necessary to install, deliver, and maintain persistent, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, total Internet Access Services to 26 DoDDS Pacific/DDESS Guam facilities located on U.S. Military Bases in the Pacific.  Because the locations are physically on U.S. Military Bases, the contractor will be responsible for negotiating with each base's command to allow access for their tranmission media.  There are five locations in Korea, five in Okinawa, four in Guam, and twelve in Mainland Japan.  Any resulting contract will be a firm-fixed price, single award contract, therefore, any potential successful contractor must have the capability to provide these services in all of these locations.  Any potential subcontract arrangements will be acceptable.  Bandwidth requirements will vary from location to location and will range between 1.5Mbps and 100Mbps.

All Market Research information shall be submitted to Mr. Henry Taylor, via either email Henry.Taylor@pac.dodea.edu or by Fax No. 011-81-98-957-4535.
