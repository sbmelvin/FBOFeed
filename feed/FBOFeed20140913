(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT AND NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with University of North Carolina (UNC)-Renaissance Computing Institute (RENCI), Chapel Hill, NC 27517 , pursuant to 41 U.S.C.3304(a)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The RENCI will provide consulting and support to NIEHS to establish a scientific data management system using the iRODS software. The NIEHS requires a data and information management solution for data, sample, budget, and resource management mandates that are being implemented at the NIH level. These requirements include cost and inventory tracking impacting workflow, safety, security, mandatory registration documentation, and related work with viral vector stocks. . iRODS technology has the capability to run automatic quality and completeness checks across files, sample entries, and data within the files. Additionally, the management of multiple file systems transparently, a key feature of the iRODS design, allowing for multiple users to identify and access files and samples as needed, meaning that the sudden loss of a member of the research group does not mean a loss in access to the needed data or samples. Much of the iRODS functionality is dependent upon user metadata inclusion that can be enabled by customization of the system. The NIEHS requires iRODS expertise with an understanding of genomics, environment sciences, and data management analysis for scientific high performance computing. After conducting market research, RENCI is found to be the only provider of iRODs consulting for applied science. The iRODs software was originally developed by the RENCI at UNC. The RENCI conducts significant software development and scientific usage of the iRODS software. The UNC's RENCI is the only group responsible for developing and maintaining the base software used for this consulting category. The NIEHS requires the following tasks: 1. The consultant shall customize the NIEHS software to meet the agency's specific needs. The NIEHS instance of the software will be configured for optimal best practices; 2. The consultant will assist the NIEHS scientific teams to interface with and auto-populating the iRODS metadata catalogue with descriptors. Results from the scientific equipment and instrumentation present in the laboratories will be added to the database's capabilities; 3. Specific files that are produced by the NIEHS website Core Lab Submission Forms shall be setup with iRODS to be utilized by the research group for labeling and later searching of files, as well as producing reports specific to each research group; 4. The consultant will provide a data management structure and a customized reporting capacity that will provide researchers with the ability to find data and samples quickly and meet the requirements of the NIEHS participation in the Clean Sweep program; 5. The consultant will provide analysis to the NIEHS on using this technology for our specific types of research data. The analysis shall provide a set of recommendations to include some analysis on how to take advantage of combining multiple disconnected data sources and creating a centralized system for tracking and controlling data, requests, samples, and expenditures within research groups; 6. The consultant shall customize the open source iRODS software to interface with the instruments utilized by the Viral Vector Core (VVC); 7. The consultant shall customize the open source iRODS software to utilize the specific files (structured csv files) that are produced by the NIEHS VVC submission form on the NIEHS Junction webpage. Assistance will be provided to produce reports such as Principal Investigator usage reports, quarterly budget analysis reports, and Clean Sweep tracking reports. The training and consulting will include methods to provide real-time reports that accurately reflect the current status of budget and samples and allow us to monitor and ensure that research groups have the information to operate within budget; 8. Data Management training will be provided on the software, its configurations, its setup parameters, and how its interface operates. Six training sessions not to exceed 2 hours each will be provided. The training will include content to the NIEHS on how to use the iRODS technology; 9. Presentations to executive management are required. Three 1 hour presentations are required to include specific information from the above tasks. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 5 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no affirmative responses are received within 5 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, the order will be issued to UNC. NAICS Code/Size is 541519/$25.5 Million. Award is subject to approval of Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition. This procurement is to be processed using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12 Commercial Item Acquisition of Commercial Items. There is no solicitation package available. For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Dee Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov.

<DESC>Pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1) (i), Contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Secretary (OS) Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health (OASH) Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) has a requirement to provide logistical and technical support services for organizing and implementing a number of activities critical to upholding OHRP's regulatory and educational mandate. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Program Support Center (PSC), Acquisition Management Services (AMS) intends to sole source to: Seamon Corporation, Greenbelt, MD.
<p>The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) anticipates planning, developing, and implementing a number of activities critical to upholding OHRP's regulatory and educational mandate. These activities will be undertaken largely by OHRP's Division of Policy and Assurances (DPA) and Division of Education and Development (DED) and will include technical services related to meetings of the Secretary's Advisory Committee for Human Research Protections (such as producing Committee minutes).</p>
<p>DPA is expecting to draft new regulations and guidance pursuant to its policymaking mandate, including the White House and HHS Secretary's initiative to overhaul the regulations for the protection of human research subjects. The staff workload for the conduct of such policy and educational initiatives is massive and the use of outside contracts for logistical and technical support is critical.<br /><br />DED is expecting to plan, develop, and implement up to 10 educational offerings during the period of contract, including Research Community Forums and Quality Assessment Workshops. DED also expects to plan and implement webinars on human subjects protections issues for the broad research community. In addition, DED is expecting to utilize e-learning technologies to develop informational materials directed toward the general public to better inform them about biomedical research and human subjects participation. The purpose of the contract is to provide the logistical and technical support services for organizing and implementing each activity.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive proposal. No solicitation document is available. All responsible sources that have determined that they can provide the requisite services may submit capabilities statements. The email subject line must reference OS139572 Capability Statement. All responses are due by September 17, 2014, 4:00PM Eastern time and are to be emailed to David.Morgan@psc.hhs.gov.. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK


Purpose:

To provide remedial training for Government employees requiring skills applicable to the performance of their designated work functions through a School at Work (SAW) career development program at the VA Cincinnati Medical Center. Contractor shall provide a blended and comprehensive program of on-line, E-Learning materials delivery and classroom training during designated training times of their normally scheduled work hours and that incorporates longitudinal elements of current School at Work training program in place. The training shall provide learning opportunities to employees in GS-01 thru GS-05 and employees in Wage Grade equivalent. In the School at Work program, employees develop computer skills, math, reading, grammar, writing, medical terminology, patient safety and satisfaction skills, and organizational skills. 

Currently, VA Cincinnati Medical Center has limited opportunities for employees in grades GS-01 thru GS-05 and equivalent Wage Grades. To improve upward mobility, diversity, loyalty, talent, and patient care, those employees who "feel stuck" in entry-level positions need to be provided with new learning opportunities and better chances to succeed. To improve diversity within the organization and to improve EEO performance, there is a need to have employees learn new tasks and learn how to develop their skills in order to be successful in their career advancement.  


Program requirements: 

Contractor is to provide a six month career development system that will be delivered within the a blended learning system: on-line coursework, DVD classroom sessions, and participant workbooks. Contractor will manage a workplace education and E-Learning training program. The curriculum shall focus on two key components: education and career development. Throughout the program, the students develop a Career and Learning Plan (CLP) that helps them identify and achieve personal career goals through self-assessments and other exercises. Contractor shall offer class two hours per week for twenty-two (22) weeks for a total of six months in sessions coordinated with the using service.

The provided by the medical center shall provide a Coach and Career Advisor, who facilitates the blended learning system, and can come from a variety of department/positions. The Coach should commit 4 hours per week, two hours in the classroom with the students, and approximately two (2) hours in the management of the program. The coach serves as a project manager for the entire School at Work (SAW) class, oversees and facilitates SAW, works closely with internal SAW support staff, keeps attendance records, and monitors the completion of the online components. The Coach should have good computer skills, strong communication and facilitation skills, previous experience in education, recruiting, or human resources, and must be familiar with the healthcare organization.  

The Career Advisor will meet one-on-one with students throughout the course to help them map out their Career and Learning Plan.  The Career Advisor is recommended to meet with each student one-on-one twice during their six-month SAW class. The meeting should last from 30 minutes to 1 hour.


Qualifications for Entry in the Program:
Contractor is responsible to conduct a basic competencies assessment of reading skills/reading comprehension and to identify areas of deficiency for each student. Students enrolled in the program have a minimum reading level of 9th grade in order to be successful. 

VHA High Performance Development Model (HPDM):

Contractor shall provide a training program compliant with the VHA High Performance Development Model (HPDM) and the workforce development program 2008.

Students in the program will spend 45 hours over the 6 month period in the classroom and 2 hours per week in self-study on their own time.  Most facilities allow students to use two hours clock-time per week to attend class. Student recruiting and testing takes 6 to 8 weeks prior to the start of SAW and requires 3 to 4 hours per week of Coach time to oversee this process.  Once classes begin, the Coach will spend approximately 4 hours per week facilitating and managing the program.  The contractor shall provide assistance to the Coach through their Client Relations Coordinators who are available every business day, all day, to answer questions, solve problems, and advise for maximum outcome results.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to award a one-time sole source contract to X-RIS (X-ray Imaging Solutions) SPRL, Rue de la Ferme 75/1, 4430 ANS - Belgium for two (2) battery and AC powered, portable, continually controllable, variable-energy x-ray source, real-time imaging x-ray systems including two large format imaging panels under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Technical Specifications</span></strong>:<br />The FBI has a requirement for two (2) battery and AC powered, portable, continually controllable, variable-energy x-ray source, real-time imaging x-ray systems including two large format (41cm x 41cm or greater area), 200&micro;m or better pixel size, imaging panels. One of the variable energy x-ray sources must be capable of producing x-rays at energies from 20kV to 160kV and the second source must be capable of producing x-rays at energies from 50KV to 200kV. The&nbsp;FBI also requires one higher definition imaging screen with an imaging area of at least 10cm x 5cm. A pixel size of 50 micrometers or smaller is required for this imaging panel. Two laptop computer workstations with compatible system software and all necessary power controllers, computer controls, and cabling are required for the operation and image manipulation on the required systems. The x-ray generator, x-ray imager, computer hardware and software, and all accessories must be compatible. The systems must be capable of both wired and wireless operation. To utilize the systems in the Laboratory building, the FBI requires a compatible radiation shielding cabinet for the 200kV system, certified by the manufacturer to provide adequate shielding to protect the user at levels mandated by applicable Federal safety standards in force at the time of contract award. The cabinet shall have all necessary interlocks designed to operate with the x-ray generator and shall have all required radiation lights, buzzers and warning symbols. Systems have a minimum 1 year warranty on components and 1 year of remote technical support.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sole Source Justification</span></strong>:<br />The FBI has the need to take high quality, highly detailed x-rays with an imaging area of at least 41cm x 41cm for both forensic examination and research purposes. The FBI also requires this equipment to be portable and battery operated so that examinations can be conducted in the field as needed. Therefore, the FBI requires a portable, real time EOD DR x-ray which has a continually variable energy x-ray source which enables the user to begin x-raying the evidence, examine the results on a remote computer in real time, and to adjust the x-ray energy to obtain the best possible image. Two battery powered, portable generators are needed, one which produces controllable x-ray potentials of 20 to 160 kilovolts(kV) at 160 watts, and one which produces controllable x-ray potentials of 50 to 200 kV at 200 watts. The lower kV range is required for very light packages with subtle density gradients. The higher kV range is required for items which may be heavily shielded or contain components which are made of dense metals or liquids. A pixel size of 200 micrometers or smaller is required for the imaging panels on these systems.<br />Accurate x-rays are also required, for example, in making very fine measurements of detonators, which are then dissected using tools which measure drilling depth to the hundredths of millimeters. High quality radiography is needed to examine the construction techniques of detonators and IEDs prior to their disassembly. An imaging are of at least 10cm x 5cm is required for this purpose. A pixel size of 50 micrometers or smaller is required for the imaging panel on this system. It is required that this panel be compatible with the x-ray generator and software utilized by the larger format panels.<br /><br />The FBI has a requirement for two different, continually variable, controllable energy, x-ray sources, which can be met by X-ray Imaging Solutions of Ans, Belgium (XRIS) by supplying one Gem-X 160 x-ray generator and one Gem-X200 x-ray generator. The Gem-X 160 can produce continually controllable, variable energy X-rays from 20kV to 160kV. The Gem-X200 can produce continually controllable, variable energy X-rays from 50kV to 200kV.<br /><br />The system also requires compatible real-time x-ray imaging panels. For general x-ray imaging, two (2) portable panels, each at least 41cm x 41cm imaging area with 200 &mu;m resolution are required. A fluoroscopy refresh rate of 1 frame per second or better on all panels is required. The XRIS DeReO WA-1 imaging panels meet these requirements. For detonator examination, a separate high resolution panel of at least 10cm x 5cm with at least 50 &mu;m resolution is required. The XRIS DeReO HR1 meets these requirements. <br />The FBI also requires a compatible, radiation shielding cabinet supplied by XRIS designed to prevent personnel exposure to x-ray radiation from the equipment when it is being operated in the Laboratory environment. The cabinet shall have all necessary interlocks designed to operated with the XRIS imagers and shall have all required radiation lights, buzzers and warning symbols.<br /><br />Market survey has concluded that the only company that can produce a portable, variable energy, real time x-ray system meeting these requirements is X-ray Imaging Solutions in Ans, Belgium. The system was compared with systems available from OpenVison, Logos Imaging, Vidisco, NexRay, Scanna and ScanX. The systems from Logos, Vidisco, NexRay, Scanna, and ScanX do not meet the requirements of the FBI because they are designed to work with a pulsed X-ray source. OpenVision offers a system with available x-ray panels of suitable size and resolution and an available portable x-ray generator with continually variable x-ray potential (model CP-1201), however it can only produce x-ray output energies from 60kV to 120kV. <br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to this office by 2:00 pm, Eastern, September 17, 2014, by email to the attention of Lynda M. Theisen, Contracting Officer, at <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lynda.Theisen@ic.fbi.gov</span></strong> or by fax at 703-632-8480. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br /><br />Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.

<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON INDEMNIFICATION REQUESTS UNDER CONTRACTS FOR A QUALIFIED ANTI-TERRORISM TECHNOLOGY (NOV 2004)</p>
<p>a. General Information. (1) This contract provides for the delivery of a product, service, technology, or other matter that has been or could be designated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as a Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology (QATT) under the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies (SAFETY) Act, 6 U.S.C. 441-444. The SAFETY Act defines a QATT as "any product, equipment, service (including support services), device, or technology (including information technology) designed, developed, modified, or procured for the specific purpose of preventing, detecting, identifying, or deterring acts of terrorism or limiting the harm such acts might otherwise cause." The statute provides sellers of QATTs with significant legal protections against third-party products liability lawsuits.</p>
<p>(2) The SAFETY Act is administered by DHS. The DHS regulations implementing this statute are found at 68 Federal Register 59684 (October 16, 2003) and 6 CFR 25.1-25.9. Additional information about the SAFETY Act is found on the DHS internet site at: https://www.safetyact.gov. Offerors are encouraged to contact the DHS for additional information about this program, and, in appropriate cases, to submit an application to the DHS requesting that their product, service, or technology be designated as a QATT.</p>
<p>(3) Eligibility for a SAFETY Act designation does not preclude the granting of indemnification under Public Law 85-804. The SAFETY Act's liability protections, however, were designed to substantially reduce the need for the United States to provide indemnification to the sellers of anti-terrorism technologies.</p>
<p>(4) Executive Order (E.O.) 10789, governing the indemnification process, has been amended to require all Federal agencies, including the Department of the Army, to follow certain procedures to ensure that the potential applicability of the SAFETY Act is considered before any indemnification is granted for an anti-terrorism technology. Section 25(a) of E.O. 10789 provides that indemnification may not be approved with respect to any matter that has been or could be designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security as a QATT, unless, after consideration of the authority provided by the SAFETY Act, there has been a determination that indemnification is necessary for the timely and effective conduct of Unites States military or intelligence activities.</p>
<p>b. Contents of Indemnification Requests. In addition to providing the information required by Federal Acquisition Regulation 50.403-1, contractors are encouraged to fully explain why indemnification is necessary for the timely and effective conduct of United States military or intelligence activities, in view of the protections available under the SAFETY Act. <br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>AFFARS 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (April 2014)</p>
<p>a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact Mr. David E. Jones, HQ AETC/A7K 2035 First Street West Ste 1, Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4304, (210) 652-7907, fax (210) 652-8344, david.jones9@randolph.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU or ARISRA level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>WAWF Electronic Invoicing Instructions</p>
<p>All payments are to be paid via the Internet through the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) system. WAWF may be accessed at https://wawf.eb.mil. WAWF training may be accessed online at http://www.wawftraining.com. Payment information may be accessed using the DFAS website at https://www.dfas.mil.

Acceptable certification qualifications for this requirement are as follows: <br />- Court interpreter <br />- Department of State Interpreters Examination<br />- Accreditation as an interpreter from a school of languages and linguistics.</p>
<p>Additionally, simultaneous interpreters must have a minimum of 3 years experience with Department of Defense and/or State Department related terms and terminology during briefings simulation exercises and lectures and must be able to interpret "all dialogue" to include titles and government affiliations to interact with senior foreign representatives and diplomats.</p>

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered as an amendment on Friday, September 19, 2014. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Offerors or quoters are urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable. In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award. Site Visit will be conducted on September 17, 2014 at 10:00AM, Fort Irwin, Building 505. Please R.S.V.P. attendance and number of personnel that will attend and provide a by name list (full name, date of birth and drivers license number)to SFC Diana McInnis, Diana.p.mcinnis.mil@mail.mil by September 16, 2014 9:00 AM PST. No questions will be asked during the site visit. Contractor will present questions by September 18, 2014 10:00 AM PST, questions will be answered and posted on September 19, 2014. <BR> <BR>

PURPOSE <br>  <br> 	The services to be provided under this contract are those required to survey and characterize mussels and their habitats at the James River Streambank Protection Project located in Amherst County.  These semi-quantitative surveys will describe both the extent and composition of mussel beds within the survey boundaries.   <br>  <br> II. PROJECT BACKGROUND <br>  <br> The Amherst County Service Authority (ACSA) maintains a 24-inch interceptor gravity sewer line running along the James River that is in imminent danger of being damaged through streambank erosion.  Should the erosion continue and the sewer line become compromised, large quantities of sewage would be released into the James River causing significant environmental and human health impacts.  The 24-inch interceptor gravity sewer line that runs along the James River is located along a narrow area between the James River and Blackwater Creek Trail and the access road that is used to service and maintain it.  Restoration and protection of the streambank is required in order to protect this vital piece of infrastructure.  The Norfolk District is contracting the services described in this scope of work as required for compliance with the Virginia Endangered Species Act, the Federal Endangered Species Act Cooperative Agreement and the Federal Endangered Species Act.   <br>  <br> III. CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY <br>  <br> Task 1. CREATE INITIAL SURVEY WORK PLAN AND RELOCATION PLAN: Prior to beginning the mussel survey, the contractor must provide a survey work plan and relocation plan to US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in order to receive approval from the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VDGIF).  Protocols for the mussel survey and relocation plans must comply with  quote mark Freshwater Mussel Guidelines for Virginia quote mark , most recently updated 9-4-13.   <br>  <br> Task 2.  CONDUCT MUSSEL SURVEYS MUSSEL RELOCATIONS: The contractor will perform a  quote mark Full Survey quote mark  as described in  quote mark Freshwater Mussel Guidelines for Virginia quote mark , i.e. delineating mussel beds that may be influenced by streambank stabilization activities 200 meters upstream and 800 meters downstream of the project site. <br>  <br> During the survey, if mussel species that are not federally listed are found within the direct project footprint or within imminent danger from project impacts, these mussels may be relocated to suitable habitat unless otherwise directed by VDGIF.  The relocation protocols which must be followed are described in the  quote mark Freshwater Mussel Guidelines for Virginia quote mark  (updated 9/4/2013).  If Federally-listed mussel species are found during the initial survey, they will not be relocated.  Instead, the USACE will be notified and the location of each animal will be recorded and photographed.   <br>  <br> B.  Task 3.  PREPARE A REPORT:  The Contractor shall prepare a report consolidating the data obtained from Task 1.  GIS files shall be included in the report showing spatially correct drawings of the survey areas.  At a minimum these GIS drawings must also include: <br> 		- perimeter of the survey areas <br> 		- bottom substrate characterizations <br> 		- transect locations <br> 		- qualitative survey locations <br> 		- point locations for significant resources (i.e. federally protected species) <br> 		- mussel bed delineations of 1 per 2 square meters <br> 		- mussel bed delineations of 1 per 1 square meters <br> 		- edge of water during survey <br> -locations of Federally-listed individual <br> The report shall also include descriptions and tables of the unionid fauna collected in Task 2 including trends in species characteristics, age distribution, habitat preferences, spatial distribution, catch per unit effort, copies of all field sheets, and conclusions and recommendations from the Contractor pertaining to this survey area.   <br>  <br> Boat and Diver Support (Optional Item) <br>  Depending on the depth and/or condition  of the river, the contractor may or may not need a boat and divers to complete that survey.  <br>  <br> Full Request for Quote is attached.
