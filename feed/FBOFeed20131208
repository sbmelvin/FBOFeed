<p>PASS/BASE ACCESS TO THE 106TH RESCUE WING, F.S. GABRESKI ANG</p>
<p>Contractors should be aware that this is a Military Installation and that all access to this installation is granted by the 106 Rescue Wing Security Forces. Prior to making deliveries please contact (631) 723-7478 and follow instructions provided by the Security Forces for access to the 106th Rescue Wing, Gabreski Airport, NY. If a gate pass is not granted to a contractor allowing the delivery of goods, execution of warranty support, or performance of services please contact the contracting officer.<br />A contractor's badge will be issued once the contractor enters the main gate at F.S. Gabreski Airport. Be sure that all of your employees have the proper ID (drivers license, state ID, immigration card, U.S. Passport, etc.). If they do not have the proper ID, they will be turned away.</p>
<p>A list of all prospective contractors (full name, date of birth, social security number, and home address) will be provided to Security Forces by the vendor no less than 21 business days from the date work is expected to start, for the purposes of a criminal history check. Note: All additions, deletions and/or changes to the contractor list provided to security forces will require the 21 work day lead time, unless otherwise agreed upon between Security Forces, Environmental, and Base Contracting, for the purposes of a criminal history check. The following is a guide to who will be allowed access to the installation.</p>
<p>1. All prospective contractors MUST be U.S. citizens or MUST have established and maintain legal residence in the U.S., and be authorized by the US government to work in the United States (i.e. Green card, worker authorization, etc.). All prospective contractors MUST have at least one form of U.S. government issued photo identification (driver's license, U.S. passport, U.S. work visa, etc.) for entry to the installation. Security Forces will review any questionable identification documents for determination as to whether or not said identification is authorized for access to the installation.</p>
<p>2. All prospective contractors, once it has been established that they maintain the appropriate credential as described in paragraph 1 above, are subject to a Criminal History Check. If a prospective contractor is found to have been "arrested" (conviction not required) within the last ten (10) years for any of the following offenses as defined in The New York State Penal Laws: any felony assault; draft evasion; any felony drug charges; Indecent acts or liberties with a child under 16; molestation to include child pornography and sex abuse; kidnapping; manslaughter; murder; rape and related sex offences; robbery; arson; felony criminal mischief; fire arms offences; any grand larceny; burglary and felony larceny charges; any charges related to terrorism; any active warrants from any jurisdiction; and any other offense deemed to be in the best interest of the government to refuse entry to having persons committed them, the prospective contractor will not be allowed legal access to the installation for the purpose of employment, unless otherwise agreed upon by Security Forces, Civil Engineering, Base Contracting, and authorized by the Base Commander.</p>
<p>Note: For the purposes of Contracting services at the 106 RQW, it is implied that, by the contracting agreement, that any and all parties agree to a Criminal History Background Check once entering into any contract with the 106 RQW. Any documents that are provided and found fraudulent to include, but not be limited to driver's licenses, contracting licenses, etc., will result in an arrest and potential termination for default of the contract. All contractors are subject to search in order to obtain entry onto the installation and while working on the installation. Any refusal to submit to a search of their person or vehicle will be deemed as a violent act of aggression against the installation and will be cause for dismissal from the installation and revocation of future privileges and installation access.</p>
<p>A contractor's badge will be issued once the contractor enters the main gate at F.S. Gabreski Airport. Be sure that all of your employees have the proper ID (drivers license, state ID, immigration card, U.S. Passport, etc.). If they do not have the proper ID, they will be turned away. The U.S. Government will not be held liable for any delays or breach of contract caused by refusal of the 106th RQW Security Forces.</p>
