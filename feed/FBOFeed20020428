THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation number RFQ NC-AJF100-2-40028 is issued as a Request For Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. This procurement action is full and open. The NAICS code is 541620.   A firm is a small business for the purpose of this requirement if it size standard is $6 million.  The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), National Marine Sanctuary Program (NMSP) is contemplating the award of a contract with a five year ordering period  to conduct a series of education, training, and assessment activities on the distribution and abundance of marine fishes and invertebrates in various National Marine Sanctuaries (see www.nos.noaa.gov/) Specifically,  the NMSP seeks at a minimum to:  (1) Conduct a continuing series of education and outreach activities for the general public concerning the conservation and protection of fishes and invertebrates in the NMSP. The  contractor shall provide  the qualifications and fitness of qualified candidate SCUBA divers as evidenced by submission of  recent dive logs and documented qualifications from diving organizations such as PADI, YMCA, and NAUI.  The contractor shall  assist the NMSP in the identification of suitable venues and locations within the sanctuaries for these activities at local dive shops, dive clubs, recreation clubs, conservation organizations, government organizations, academic organizations, etc.  The NMSP expects between 5-10 of these activities every 12 months; (2) Coordinate and lead a series of continuing  in-situ surveys and assessments  of the distribution and abundance of fishes and invertebrates with qualified volunteers (e.g. SCUBA divers) at preselected and agreed upon locations selected by the NMSP and the contractor in various Sanctuaries.  The contractor responsibilities shall include arranging transportation, training of volunteers, etc.  The government expects  between 5-10 of these activities every 12 months; (3) Develop and maintain contractor proposed government materials for education, outreach, and training associated with surveying the distribution and abundance of fishes and invertebrates in the Sanctuaries; (4) Develop and maintain the capacity quickly and efficiently to collect, organize, distribute, and analyze survey results for use by the NMSP; and (5) Prepare and distribute to the Sanctuary Program the survey reports on individual surveys, summary reports for individual sanctuaries, and an annual report on all surveys conducted in NMS.

The base requirements and potential optional requirements are  intended to seamlessly build upon and expand recent surveys and training activities; the contractor shall be familiar with these surveys with assistance from personnel in the Sanctuary Program, which are conducted at most of the NMS and continue for a period of five (5) years.
