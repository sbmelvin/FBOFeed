<RESPDATE>043010
<CONTACT>Jack May, Phone (310) 416-1703, Email jack.may@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW), SBSS F/O Program Office, intends to release a solicitation to acquire a second SBSS satellite that is integrated with the existing SBSS Block 10 ground system infrastructure, in order to ensure continuity of service for the space situational awareness (SSA) space tier. SBSS F/O is an Acquisition Category ID program. The NAICS code for this announcement is 336414 with the applicable size standard of 1,000 personnel.
<p>The objective of SBSS F/O is to deliver space surveillance capabilities to address the SSA needs of the warfighter. The SBSS F/O mission is to collect metric position and Space Object Identification data on manmade Resident Space Objects. SBSS F/O will operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to serve users who require SSA of deep-space and near-earth resident objects. SBSS F/O will be part of a "Family of Systems", interoperable with existing systems, and enhancing the global reach of command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence for Air Force Space Control. The F/O capability will be fielded to mitigate the end of life of the SBSS Block 10 satellite, and the acquisition will be based on existing Block 10 requirements with an expected award in 2nd qtr FY11 and anticipated launch by early 1st qtr FY15. This contract will also include options for interim contractor support, transition support, special studies, and sustainment for up to five years. Proposal instructions and timelines will be communicated via the Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>In order to receive the bidder's library password, a copy of any secret collateral documents, and participate in future Industry Days, potential Prime Contractors must submit a copy of their Facility Clearance Level (FCL) certifying they have a facility authorized for storage and they are authorized to process Secret collateral information as well as the name and number of the respective security and technical POC. The FCL and POCs must be submitted no later than 30 April 2010 to Jim Austin at jim.austin@losangeles.af.mil who will in turn coordinate appropriate method and manner for delivery of the Secret Technical Requirements Document (TRD) to an authorized facility. Response to this notice from small and small disadvantaged businesses qualified to prime this opportunity is encouraged.</p>
<p>Potentially interested prime contractors will be invited to attend our planned Industry Day(s). Our first Industry Day is tentatively planned for 18 May 10. While the TRD is Secret collateral, industry discussions will be held at a higher level. Additionally, the potential bidders must have a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) in place for receipt of additional materials. Each Prime Contractor will be limited to six attendees. Each person attending must have a current TS/SSBI with DCID 6/4 eligibility and be briefed SI/TK that can be validated via the joint personnel adjudication system (JPAS). If JPAS verification cannot be provided, then verification of sensitive compartmented information access from other agencies will be accepted. A Prime Contractor will submit for each person a Personnel Access Request (PAR), Special Access Program (SAP) Format 1, a SF86 that is signed/dated within the last year, a JPAS printout and evidence of a local records check in the last year. If a person is currently accessed to an Air Force SAP sponsored by SYSW, the SF86 is current within the last year and the local records check was accomplished within the last year, then only a PAR with JPAS printout is required. In all cases, the justification for SAP access is "To participate in SBSS Follow-On Industry Day". Anyone not meeting Tier 1 standards will not be allowed to participate in industry discussions.</p>
<p>As stated above, each Prime Contractor must have a SCIF that is either currently accredited by SYSW or must provide documentation showing the Prime Contractor has a currently accredited SCIF sponsored by another agency. Further, Prime Contractors must identify via a one or two page concept of operations, how they will store/process and segregate SBSS Follow-On information, what building/rooms will be used and, if applicable, identify the sponsor of your SCIF who will approve processing and storage of SBSS material in their sponsored facility.</p>
<p>Potential Prime Contractors invited to the industry discussions will receive separate instruction via the invitation to attend identifying the POC for submission of SAP Format 1 PARs and facility documentation.</p>
<p>BIDDERS LIBRARY<br />The RFP and attachments along with any subsequent document releases will be attached and posted under this GPE, https://www.fbo.gov/.</p>
<p>OMBUDSMAN: The SMC Ombudsman is Mr. James Gill. You can reach him at james.gill@losangeles.af.mil or at (310) 653-1789. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors. The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate concerns with potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels to communicate his concern during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman will communicate certain offeror issues, disagreements, and recommendations on this acquisition into the proper channels. The Ombudsman's role is not to diminish the authority of the program director or the contracting officer but to advocate an offeror's concern on a non-attribution basis. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as the source of the concern when requested by the offeror. <br />Pursuant to the SAFETY Act and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 50.205-2(b)(1)(i), SYSW is requesting a pre-qualification designation notice and it is under review by DHS.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice (synopsis) for a full and open competitive procurement in accordance with FAR Part 5.203; to provide notice of the Government's proposed contract action listed herein.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a requirement to explore the predictive validity of Drug Evaluation and Classification (DEC) program tests. NHTSA's Office of Behavioral Safety Research (OBSR) directs a national behavioral research, test, demonstration, and technology development program to build a scientific information base supporting the development and implementation of programs to prevent or reduce unsafe behaviors of road users and to promote safe driving behaviors. Research areas include: alcohol-impaired driving, drug-impaired driving, non-use of occupant protection restraints, speeding and unsafe driving behaviors, pedestrian safety, motorcyclist safety, novice drivers, older drivers, driver education and training, enforcement, prosecution and judicial services, and emergency medical services. The Office of Behavioral Safety Research conducts research in the development of promising countermeasure programs to determine effectiveness and evaluates selected State and local countermeasure programs and NHTSA demonstration programs aimed at reducing or eliminating unsafe actions and crash-generating situations. Examples of these studies can be found at: http://ntlsearch.bts.gov/tris/ntlc/nhtsa/index.shtm.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Research investigating the impairing effects of various drugs on a driver's ability to safely operate his/her car has not been definitive. Tests used to assess impairment from drug use are usually developed for the specific study in which they are used, and are, in many cases, unstandardized. Those tests used more widely, especially by law enforcement officers, have not been specifically validated to determine impairment based on drug use (other than those that have been thusfar standardized for determining recent alcohol use). Law enforcement officers who are certified as Drug Recognition Experts (DREs) are trained to utilize a variety of readily observable signs and symptoms that are accepted in the medical community as reliable indicators of drug influence. The program enables officers to determine whether a suspect is under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs; and if so, the DRE combines basic medical knowledge about drug pharmacodynamics with the administration of psychomotor tests to determine the category of drugs. This form of training is costly in time (it is a 9-day course) and resources.</p>
<p>During an evaluation, the DRE collects information on the suspects's current condition, a brief medical history, and also assesses the suspect's pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, pupil size and reaction to light, and psychomotor function. The DRE also examines the suspect's visual tracking, visual convergence, smooth pursuit and Horizontal and Vertical Gaze Nystagmus (HGN and VGN, respectively). This information is documented consistently on a form, the Drug Influence Evaluation (DIE) "Face Sheet", by all DREs. Using the DIE, the DRE captures about 60 different elements, in numerical, pictorial and narrative form. The DRE also summarizes his or her observations in a narrative statement. Based on the information gathered, the DRE determines whether the subject is under the influence of drugs, the specific category of drugs, and requests that the suspect provide a biological specimen for confirmation.</p>
<p>Purpose:</p>
<p>There has been no systematic investigation of whether it is necessary for the DREs to collect all of the information or whether a core set of the measures are more directly relevant. Therefore, the OBSR is interested in conducting a study to collect and code all the information found on a large sample of DIE data sheets to determine which combination(s) elements coalesce to predict the toxicology-confirmed results of the evaluation.</p>
<p>The objectives of this study are to:<br />(a) gather a sample of DIE Face Sheets from several Law Enforcement Agencies that participate in the DEC Program along with the corresponding toxicological test results based on blood samples;<br />(b) code the numerical, pictorial, and narrative information found on the data sheets and the confirmation results, and create a database of measures from the sample;<br />(c) determine accuracy of the DRE opinions using the corresponding toxicological confirmation results; and<br />(d) analyze the data to identify of groups of interrelated variables to see how they are correlated to each other and the drug class confirmed by blood samples.</p>
<p><br />Solicitation Information:</p>
<p>The Government contemplates that a Time and Material type Contract with a period of performance not to exceed eighteen (18) months will be awarded. The forthcoming solicitation and any related documents to this procurement will only be available electronically for download at https://www.fedbizopps.gov referenced by the solicitation number (DTNH22-10-R-00376). The anticipated issuance date of the forthcoming solicitation is on or about May 7, 2010. However, it is the Offeror's sole responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential Offerors will also be solely responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any), as well as other related documents.</p>
<p>NO FURTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVALABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>

<DESC><p>Introduction:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Human Factors/Engineering Integration Division, conducts studies to identify and evaluate how vehicle subsystems can affect crash risk and what countermeasures would minimize that risk. Development of effective countermeasures requires an understanding of how the driving population processes information from the vehicle and roadway environment and then responds with vehicle control actions to avoid collisions. This interaction between the driver and the vehicle occurs through operation of controls, reading displays, interpreting signal light cues from other vehicles, and observing roadway events through direct and indirect visibility systems (i.e., windows and mirrors). These interactions define the interfaces between the driver and the vehicle.<br /><br />To understand the role of driver/vehicle interaction in crash avoidance, various types of human factors studies are needed to obtain data on driver performance and behavior in response to various vehicle system design parameters that comprise this interface. Examples of crash avoidance systems of interest to NHTSA include:</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc">
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Advanced technology displays and controls, including driver assistance technologies</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Forward and rearward lighting/signaling systems</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">Mirrors and other indirect visibility systems (i.e., video)</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in">Vehicle glazing that affects driver visibility</li>
</ul>
<p>Detailed information on how drivers interact with these types of vehicle subsystems is needed to better understand how they affect crash risk, to define system performance requirements that are compatible with the range of driver capabilities, and to predict the effectiveness of possible countermeasures. This information might include such topics as:&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc">
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2">Driver decision making during different driving tasks (e.g., lane changing)</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in">The effects of driver age-related factors on performance</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in">The factors affecting driver brake application reaction time and pedal force</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in">Driver expectations and their influence on driver behavior</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in">Driver risk taking and effects on decision making</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in">Measurement of driver distraction </li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in">Driver visual search behaviors</li>
<li style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2; tab-stops: list .5in">Driver reaction to automation</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific Requirements: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The objective of this Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract is to provide NHTSA with the capability to award Task Orders that require a range of research skills that could be called into use to quickly plan, conduct, and document studies which evaluate how various vehicle-based systems affect driver behavior and performance using experiments in a laboratory setting, test track, or on public roads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The human factors tests and experiments performed under this IDIQ Contract will provide the support needed by NHTSA to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc">
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Advance deployment of new in-vehicle technologies;</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Assure that safety is maintained;</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Evaluate regulatory options; and</li>
<li style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1">Identifying potential safety problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>This high quality research capability would permit rapid initiation and completion of research efforts as NHTSA's needs are identified. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Contract Award:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>NHTSA intends to award a single, Time and Materials contract with a base year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract will also include a provision by which four (4) one-year option periods can be exercised (in one-year increments) resulting in a total possible performance period of five (5) years.<br /><br />The Solicitation will be a full and open competition.<br /><br />Solicitation:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The solicitation DTHN22-10-R-00359 will be available for downloading from http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ on or about June 1, 2010.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Questions regarding this synopsis must be submitted in writing via e-mail to NHTSAOAM@dot.gov, no later than May 20, 2010.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The anticipated award date for this resultant contract is expected on or about July 20, 2010.</p>

                                                                Grand Canyon National Park                                                      P25 Narrowband Radio Conversion Phase II 
                                                           GRCA ASTRO 25 Phase 2 System.
Grand Canyon National Park is requesting a proposal for the upgrade and implementation of three new P25 Digital Narrowband repeater systems throughout several Grand Canyon National Park (GRCA) communication sites, as well as the addition of Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO) to the existent LE Communications Network. By adding the existent PEFO P25 Digital Communication system to the GRCA Radio system, the existent Dispatch capabilities can be utilized for the Flagstaff area parks, Grand Canyon, and Petrified Forest National Park.
The proposal should be divided into 4 different National Park Service (NPS) communication sites, that once they get upgraded they will encompass the new GRCA Phase 2 P25 Digital communications system.
O'Leary Peak: The first communication site and probably the most complex of all site modifications is the replacement of the existent O'Leary VHF Analog Wideband repeater; the new proposed site will include a set of Daniels VHF/UHF P25 Digital Narrowband repeaters, enhancements to the current site solar system, as well as the addition and replacement of the existent antenna system. 
The Daniels repeater equipment will include a UHF module set that will communicate with the existent PEFO P25 UHF Linking system. As it stands right now PEFO already has two repeaters located at the north and south end of the Park, both repeaters are currently linked to each other via UHF; the proposal will modify the existent PEFO UHF Link to connect to the O'Leary Site thus allowing the access to the GRCA Law Network. This new design will allow any LE Ranger located in any of the FLAG, and PEFO area parks to communicate between each other utilizing the new radio network; GRCA will be able to use this network via Dispatch with the already included P25 receiver that Motorola will be installing at the EMS system. 
PEFO Repeater sites (North and South): Both PEFO Sites will require reprogramming of the UHF Links as well as modification to their link antenna systems to point to the new UHF Repeater located at the O'Leary Peak site. These changes will be transparent to the PEFO users and will not disrupt their local communications at any time during the construction and or alignment process. 
Mount Emma: This site will be retrofitted with two Daniels VHF Repeaters, weather tight enclosure, new DC Power system (battery bank and solar array), as well as new Omni-directional antennas. The new antenna system will be installed in the existent site tower and will serve the MED and FIRE Networks. These two systems will also be connected to Dispatch based on the new Motorola designed EMS system.
VT Ridge: This site will use three existent Motorola Quantar repeaters that will become available once the transition to the new Motorola system starts; these repeaters are currently located at the O'Leary site and will have to be re-tuned with the new site frequencies (it is also expected that accompanying duplexers will be available for use as well). The only new addition to the site will be the installation of an antenna system (new coaxial and three new Omni-directional Dipole antennas will be installed at the existent site tower) 
NOTE: The base of the site existent tower is corroded as it is seen in the included pictures, and will have to be determined safe by the tower team prior to the installation of the antennas.
General Notes:  System design shall be based on current installation being performed by Motorola, so that all systems will work with each other efficiently.  
This work is for design, construction and installation.  The Government will purchase equipment (parts and repeaters) separately.  However, design will include listing of all equipment needed, and assistance in finding and purchasing equipment.  
Assume Government will provide helicopter to transport equipment to sites (primarily Mt. Emma).  Plan on 1000 pounds to 1200 pounds of weight can be carried by the helicopter.  Based on this, estimate the hours needed to transport equipment to the sites.

<DESC>Exterior and Interior Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC), Various Locations, State of Hawaii.  The work includes, but is not limited to preparing surfaces, priming, providing exterior and interior coatings to buildings and other structures.  It also includes providing fluid applied resilient (resinous) flooring for various interior and exterior surfaces.  The work will be for the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and various Federal Agencies located in the State of Hawaii.  The contracting Officer will specify the exact locations on each task order.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 238320 and the annual size standard is $14 million.  
The proposed contract is limited to qualifying 8(a) firms in the Hawaii District Office (HDO) of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).  The Government will not consider offers from other 8(a) firms or from 8(a) firms outside of the HDO.  It has been determined that competition will be limited to 8(a) firms located within the geographical area serviced by the SBA Hawaii District Office (HDO) and other 8(a) firms with a bona fide place of business within the geographical/competitive area and with the assigned NAICS code.  All other 8(a) BD participants are deemed ineligible to submit offers.
This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent of awarding a minimum of two (2) Firm Fixed-Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts.  The Government reserves the right to cancel the procurement if only one proposal is received that offers the best value to the Government.
The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures, which require Offerors to submit a technical and price proposal for evaluation by the Government.  Offerors shall provide coefficients to adjust unit prices established by the Government, which will be specified in the contract.  The Government's unit prices are in place costs, which shall include, but not limited to, all direct and indirect costs for labor, equipment, tools, transportation (i.e., travel time to and from the site of work and other transportation costs such as pick-up trucks, etc.), records, reports, overhead, profit, taxes, insurance and cost estimates.  There will be no adjustments made to the listed unit prices after contract award.  The Contractor's coefficient will be multiplied by the unit price from the Unit Price List for the line item ordered.  This amount will be multiplied by the quantity to obtain the line item amount.  The technical factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than price.  The anticipated technical factors are:  FACTOR 1: Past Performance of the Construction Contractor; FACTOR 2: Experience and Qualifications of the Construction Contractor's Key Personnel; FACTOR 3: Management Plan for the Contract.

The Government intends to purchase, on a sole source basis in accord with FAR 6.302-1, perpetual right-to-use licenses and updates to systems engineering software, proprietary to Vitech Corporation, 2070 Chain Bridge Rd Ste 320 Vienna VA 22182-2536.  The requirement includes the following:  (1) licenses and software, quantity 2 each, to CORE Workstation software, part number WS-50-100; (2) licenses and software, quantity 2 each, to COREsim Workstation Add-on, part number WS-50-110; (3) subscriptions to software updates, term of the subscription to be 12 months from date of software acceptance, quantity 2 each, to CORE Workstation, part number MN-00-100; (4) subscriptions to software updates, term of the subscription to be 12 months from date of software acceptance, quantity 2 each, to COREsim Workstation Add-on,  part number MN-00-110.  Software licenses shall be delivered electronically FOB Destination to NSWCDD within 7 business days after award of order/contract.  (Software is currently onsite and maintenance updates shall be delivered over the term of the subscriptions.)  
No other software will satisfy this requirement at this time due to interoperability/ compatibility requirements with current work in progress.  This site currently has two other licenses to CORE software.  CORE is approved for use on the NMCI network, and is one of the few known Systems Engineering tools that meet all the capability requirements for multiple work efforts, which include (1) requirements management, (2) integrated, executable architecture development, to include specifications for all of the DoD architecture Framework (DoDAF) views, (3) mission decomposition analysis, and (4) integrated document and configuration management.  Continued use of CORE will allow current work to continue without interruption for retraining or for conversion of previous CORE files to other applications:  any substitution of software for the instant requirement would be expected to result in replacement costs far exceeding the cost of the immediate requirement.  Consideration may be given to competitive software for possible future use, particularly for Systems Engineering tools that are well-established within the acquisition community and are supported with appropriate training.
The Government will consider statements, from all responsible sources, which clearly evidence capability to provide the required proprietary items within the required delivery schedule.  Capability statements must be submitted via email to DLGR_NSWC_XDS13@navy.mil, must be received NLT 7 days after publication date of this notice, and must reference Quotation Number N00178-10-Q-3543.  All responsible sources may submit a quote, however, quotations that are not accompanied by a capability statement that evidences the ability to deliver the items specified herein will not be considered for award.  A best-value award is to be made under Simplified Acquisition (FAR Part 13) and Commercial Items (FAR Part 12) Procedures.  The Government will not issue a written solicitation as all items are specified in this notice.  Closing time and date is 7 business days after publication of this notice.

The subject items require Government Source Approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.  Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items has been solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx U.S. Naval Inventory Control Point Source Approval Information Brochure.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in repair of the same or similar items.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 561920   The Office of Air Programs, Stratospheric Protection Division of the Environmentl Protection Agency (EPA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to AgriculturalResearch Consulting for support of the 2010 Methyl Bromide Alternative Outreach (MBAO) Conference. The support will include conference planning, conference organization and inmplementation and distribution of conference proceedings.
The annual Methyl Bromide Alternatives Outreach (MBAO) conference is the only worldwide conference focused on sharing research and field trial experience relating to methyl bromide alternatives. The MBAO conference has been in effect since 1994 and continues to serve as a useful platform for sharing information, as the January 1, 2005 phase out  of methyl bromide has taken effect. The period of performance will be date of award through March 31, 2011.
Only Agricultural Research Consulting has the knowledge and past experience to organize and host a conference on alternatives to methyl bromide in a timely, inexpensive and effective manner that avoids a significant waste of government resources and insures government objectives will be successfully accomplished. First, obtaining conference services from a different source would require organizing a completely new conference from its initial stages. Second, EPA's contribution is joined by that of USDA and other entities towards Agricultural Research Consulting for the MBAO conference. Were EPA to organize and host a conference on its own, the cost of doing so would be greater than the amount EPA contributes to the organization of the MBAO conference. Third, any new conference would not have the reputation or institutional history of the MBAO conference and would not attract the same caliber of presenters or the same attendees.
Due to the nature of this procurement, EPA believes there is only one responsible source capable of meeting these requirements. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the requirement may submit a response, which is received by COB, Friday April 30, 2010, will be considered. Responses must be submitted in writing via the email link below. No telephone calls will be accepted. The point of contact for this procurement is NIcole Schuller, Contracting Officer, at schuller.nicole@epa.gov.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Water, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford in order to assist the EPA to conduct in-house research expanding the suite of environmental impact assessment models to include sustainable water use for biofuels.  Recent US biofuel standards have mandated that more of the future gasoline and diesel be manufactured from biobased feedstocks.  This work supports the efforts of the STD to provide recommendations concerning the sustainability of water use related to increased biobased feedstock production.
Related in-house research in the area of Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) in the past has lead to the development of the Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and other environmental Impacts (TRACI) which allows quantification of various impact categories such as: ozone depletion, global climate change, acidification, eutrophication, smog formation, human health cancer, noncancer, criteria pollutants, ecotoxicity, and fossil fuel depletion.  
The in-house research of expanding the suite of environmental impact assessment models to include sustainable water use for biofuels will be supported by this work which will apply a probabilistic analysis to guide a scientifically based simplification to existing water yield/use/scarcity models found within InVEST and will assist in a demonstration of the impact assessment of water use for increased biofuels production based on scenarios developed by the EPA.
A case application using InVEST will quantify the impacts of water yield/use/scarcity based on changing water use over the entire nation to determine the impacts of additional biofeedstock production over various time scenarios. The scenarios for analysis will be developed by the EPA.  A probabilistic analysis using InVEST will identify the most sensitive input parameters to the water analysis models to allow future scientifically defensible simplification of the models and increased ease of use.  

The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541620.  The size standard for this code is $7 million.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation document is available.   However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability of meeting EPA requirements by submitting technical documentation to William M Yates, Contracting Officer, at the office identified above, by e-mail yates.william@epa.gov.   The technical documentation must establish that the instrument to be provided meets all requirements.  Anticipated award date will be in June 2010.  Documentation must be submitted to William M Yates by 3:00 PM, May 11, 2010 in order to be considered by EPA.  
A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Point of Contact for this requirement is William M Yates, Contracting Officer, at (513) 487-2055, or via e-mail at yates.william@epa.gov.   Questions must be submitted in writing to William M Yates via e-mail.  Telephone queries will not be honored.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) will be conducting a follow-on study [the Cleveland Multiple Air Pollutant Study (CMAPS)] to determine the impact of local and regional air pollution sources on air quality in Cleveland, Ohio.  This requirement requiresevaluation of the association between address-level pulmonary and cardiac emergency department health effects data and CMAPS air pollution data including receptor, deterministic, and exposure modeling estimates.  Also, this requirement requires evaluating the impact on health effects estimates of using exposure and source estimates compared to using the data from the GT Craig monitoring site as well as using spatial analysis, time-series, and case crossover methodologies to understand the impact of sources and exposure on health effects.
This action is being pursued on a sole source basis because, The Metro Health System (TMHS), to the best of our knowledge, is the only known source who has collected pulmonary and cardiac outcome data from Cleveland metropolitan area hospitals at the address-level and conducted post-ER visit interviews with patients during the CMAPS study period under EPA purchase order # EP09D000599.  In addition, TMHS is the only known source who has conducted research to characterize the human health impacts of local steel mill activity in Cleveland that meets our professional requirements (peer-reviewed research which has been presented at professional conferences).
NAICS Code 541620 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development in Nicaragua requires the services of a contractor to implement a comprehensive three-year local governance program (hereafter referred to as the Program) with an optional two-year extension period. The purpose of the program will be to help municipal governments improve the delivery of basic public services to their constituents. The program will support three main objectives: 1) helping local governments become more accountable, more competent at the core tasks of governance, and more capable of managing public resources, 2) supporting citizens to more effectively engage with municipal governments in order to influence decision making and demand accountability and transparency, and 3) the implementation of municipal services and infrastructure projects.
<p>&nbsp;This program seeks to leverage significant counterpart contributions from local governments and other public and private institutions. The contractor will achieve the objectives through several modalities, including technical assistance and training, grants and subcontracts in targeted geographic areas of assistance, and establishment of a competitive grants fund open to municipal governments and civil society organizations nationwide.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

All three sites are located within Washington State along the Snake River.   Lower Monumental Dam is located near Kahlotus, Little Goose Dam is near Starbuck, and Lower Granite Dam is near Pomeroy.<BR><BR>The Diesel Generators to be replaced consist of the powerhouse emergency diesel generators.  Currently, the generators are 4160V, 500kVA, 1970s vintage engine generators with relay control systems which are difficult to maintain and operate.  Three Generators are scheduled to be replaced at three different locations:  Little Goose Lock and Dam, Lower Monumental Lock and Dam, and Lower Granite Lock and Dam.<BR><BR>The switchgears scheduled to be replaced are designated as SQ2, includes 300kVA, 4160V-480V step-down transformers and feeds power to auxiliary systems, primarily for units 5 & 6.   The switchgear is currently Federal Pacific Electric, is considered unreliable and is difficult to maintain.  Switchgears are scheduled to be replaced at two of the three locations:  Lower Monumental Lock and Dam and Lower Granite Lock and Dam.<BR><BR>The contract will require the supply and installation of three Diesel Generators and the associated control system components along with two SQ2 switchgear.

SQ2 switchgear system replacement will include associated cabinets, circuit breakers, transformers, high resistance ground, and associated conduit, cabling and wires. Modifications to the existing switchboard will also be required. Additionally, the contract will require the removal, demolition and disposal of existing switchgear, relay control system and removal and salvage of the existing diesel generators.  Concrete Patching, grouting and repair will also be required.<BR><BR>The period of performance for the contract is approximately three years.  The period of performance for onsite work is dependent upon the spring runoff and fish passage windows that generally provide seven to nine calendar months of on-site work access, each year.  Submittals, manufacture, delivery and site preparation outside of the allowable outage windows may start anytime after award.  Project site priority and coordination with other project work windows may also dictate other construction schedule requirements and restrictions.<BR><BR>Contractor is required to follow the procedures in the Army Corps of Engineers Safety Manual, at http://www.usace.army.mil/CESO/Pages/EM385-1-1,2008NEW!.aspx located at US Army Corps of Engineers homepage.

<a href="mailto:monica.pileggi@us.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>The United States Congress directed the Department of Defense (DOD) to manage appropriations totaling more than $5 Billion, since fiscal year 1992 (FY92), for intramural and extramural programs directed toward targeted medical research initiatives.  The US Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) is responsible for administering these targeted research program appropriations, and manages them through its office of the CDMRP.  The CDMRPs vision is to find and fund the best research to eradicate diseases and support the war fighter for the benefit of the American public.<BR><BR>The DOD Breast Cancer Research Program was established in FY92 by Appropriations Conference Committee Report No 102-328, which provided $25 Million (M) for research on breast cancer screening and diagnosis for military women and their family members.  In 1993 grassroots efforts by the breast cancer survivors and advocacy communities led to a FY93 congressional appropriation of $210M for peer reviewed breast cancer research.  <BR><BR>The CDMRP sought the advice of the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine (IOM) on how to best invest the $210M congressional appropriation.  While the IOM made several important recommendations, a pivotal one outlining a two-tier review process for evaluating and selecting research applications has become a cornerstone within CDMRP.  This novel two-tiered process involves reviewing every research application for scientific merit as well as programmatic relevance.  <BR><BR>The first tier of the two-tier review process is peer review.  Peer review is a criteria-based process where applications are evaluated based on their scientific and technical merit.  Applications are evaluated by scientific discipline, specialty area, or award mechanism by scientific, technical and consumer peer reviewers.  This process is supported under a separate support contract.<BR><BR>The second tier of review is programmatic review.  Applications are programmatically reviewed by members of the programs Integration Panel.  Programmatic review is a comparison-based process in which applications from multiple research areas compete in a common pool.  Programmatic review balances the potential outcomes and risks of scientifically meritorious applications.<BR><BR>This support is currently performed by an external scientific peer review contractor because the CDMRP office does not have the capability or the expertise to perform these duties in-house. <BR><BR>The CDMRP is the USAMRMC subordinate organization responsible for planning, coordinating, integrating, programming, budgeting, and executing these programs. For a better understanding of the CDMRP, a web site is available to provide a wealth of information about each of the programs: http://cdmrp.army.mil. <BR><BR>The Government intends to award a Time and Materials Task Order Requirements Contract to provide continued contractor support for scientific, technical, logistical and administrative requirements of conducting business meetings and conferences; and providing scientific and administrative support to leadership staff and multiple Integrated Program Teams within the CDMRP. <BR><BR>It is anticipated that the award will be for a two-year base period and include three single year options. Separate task orders shall be awarded under this contract for each research program by FY. The Contractor shall provide all necessary qualified personnel to provide these services for each of the selected scientific programs. All interested parties should email their interest to Ms. Monica J. Pileggi at monica.pileggi@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The primary goal of this acquisition is to establish a Department-Wide Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award Contract vehicle for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide technical, acquisition, and business support services. The acquisition and resulting multiple award contracts will be collectively referred to as TABSS (Technical, Acquisition and Business Support Services). The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting this department-wide acquisition with on behalf of DHS and all of its components. Use of this contract vehicle will be limited to all DHS components. <br />
<p>The technical, acquisition and business support services to be acquired can be categorized into three domains: (1) Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services, (2) Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services and (3) Contract Management Support Services. These domains comprise the professional services necessary to support a wide-range of Departmental requirements, to include DHS component organizations as well as those more specific in meeting the programmatic needs of the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9).</p>
<p>The objectives for this acquisition include:<br />a) Providing a comprehensive range of support services for use throughout the DHS.<br />b) Providing a continuous alignment between business strategy, business processes, and various management support services while simultaneously maintaining an acquisition approach based on flexibility and efficiency.<br />c) Leveraging the DHS spend in acquiring essential support services in an effective, economical, and expedient manner consistent with the DHS mission through the use of this enterprise-wide contract.<br />d) Promote and support DHS socio-economic goals and initiatives.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to replace numerous disparate contracts at USCG, as well as 3 multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) awarded by the DHS Strategic Sourcing Program Office. Said multiple-award BPAs consist of those for Acquisition Support Services, Financial Management Support Services and Program Management Support Services, which are scheduled to expire between May and June 2011. TABSS will also serve in companion to the Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (PACTS) contract. Although PACTS may appear to provide similar services as the TABSS Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services domain, the PACTS services are more generalized in nature. Under the TABSS vehicle, program management services are intended to meet a full range of specialized Program, Business, and Acquisition support services across multiple domains ensuring business continuity and integration. In the case of requirements overlap for a specific task order, PACTS will remain DHS' preferred vehicle.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize both unrestricted and small business set-aside award tracks. DHS intends to award a sufficient number of contracts to maintain effective competition in each of the domain tracks. There will be multiple unrestricted and Small Business award tracks, as shown below. The number of awardees per track will be determined later, and may not be uniform among tracks.<br />1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />2. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />3. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track<br />4. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />5. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />6. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; preferred SDV Track<br />7. Contract Management Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track</p>
<p>The resulting IDIQ contract will have an ordering period of five (5) years from award.</p>
<p>A draft solicitation for this acquisition is currently planned to be released in May 2010. Interested parties will have 1-2 weeks to submit questions and comments related to this draft. These questions and comments will be addressed at an Industry Day/Pre-solicitation Conference in late May or early June 2010. DHS anticipates release of a final solicitation shortly following this event. Contractors will be provided sufficient time after solicitation relaserelease to develop and submit proposals.</p>
<p>An email address has been established for this acquisition - TABSS@USCG.MIL. Due to the large number of parties interested in this acquisition, use of email communication (sent to this address) is strongly encouraged to ensure timely response to questions.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This Sources Sought Synopsis is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for providing Item Unique Identification Part-Marking services for the Air Force Automatic Identification Technology Program Management Office (AF/AIT/PMO). Please review, in this order, the Sources Sought Synopsis, the Performance Work Statement (PWS), the Capabilities Matrix spreadsheet and the List of Locations where services may potentially be performed.
<p>The Item Unique Identification (IUID) Part-Marking for the Air Force Automatic Identification Technology Program Management Office (AF/AIT/PMO) includes, but is not limited to, a contractor part-marking team to complete a defined marking scope of work at given installations and the training required for appropriate Air Force personnel to continue marking efforts in sustainment. The Air Force installations where service will be provided are worldwide and require contractor personnel to travel to these locations. A list of likely locations is provided as an attachment to this synopsis. Individual task orders will consist of anywhere from 15 to 45 locations with 275,000 to 350,000 total items to be marked. These task orders will have a 120 day period of performance. The first 30 days will consist of planning and the final 90 days will consist of part-marking. The contractor will provide all necessary supplies, services and personnel to complete these tasks; however, the government will provide the necessary barcodes and terminal devices.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates utilizing a multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreement for this award. The Air Force anticipates the ordering period will be 1 SEP 2010 through 30 JUN 2012. The Air Force anticipates this acquisition will utilize procedures outlined in FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time.

The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541519, size standard $25,000,000.00. All prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their CCR. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package. Interested contractors shall review, fill-in and return the attached Capabilities Matrix and may also submit a 4-8 page capabilities document. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements.

Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Interested contractors will clearly explain how they intend to meet the stated requirements, including the requirement for personnel to plan and part-mark 15 - 45 locations worldwide simultaneously and how the contractor will finance these operations.

<DESC>The Air Force is currently conducting a feasibility study evaluating options to upgrade the C-5 antiskid system. The C&#8209;5 Galaxy heavy cargo transport aircraft, built by Lockheed, entered operational service in 1970 and has a projected service life beyond 2040. The C-5 fleet consists of four models of aircraft (59) C-5A&rsquo;s, (46) C-5B&rsquo;s, (2) C-5C&rsquo;s and (3) C-5 M&rsquo;s. The antiskid system has known, long-standing deficiencies which affect both maintenance and flight operations. During flight-testing of the recent wheel and brake system upgrade, several of these known deficiencies were witnessed. It is for this reason the Air Force is assessing the feasibility of upgrading the antiskid system. The feasibility phase is scheduled for completion in September of 2010 and based on results of this study, the Air Force will decide whether to upgrade the entire system, replace individual components, or continue with the existing system. The decision to pursue this upgrade will be based on the ability of a new system or components to solve the known deficiencies and the estimated cost to develop and implement. If the Air Force elects to pursue development of an upgraded system or components, Request for Proposal (RFP) preparations would begin in early 2011. The retrofit may be performed on a forced attrition basis over a two-year period following certification of the new system/components. The planned upgrade will apply to all C-5 models. It is requested that all RFI responses are due no later than 28 May 2010.&nbsp; <br /><br />All requests for the RFI package shall be made to the Primary Point of Contact provided.&nbsp; <br /><br />In developing your response, you are reminded that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or pay for the information requested.&nbsp;This is not a request for proposal or an invitation for bid. The government assumes no responsibility for costs incurred by the contractor in responding to this RFI. These costs remain solely the responsibility of the responding contractor and response is voluntary.

<p>The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold"> the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit's (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory. </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Acquisition Division-Kansas City office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and FAR Subpart 13.5 Test program for Certain Commercial Items with Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems Support Company, Marietta, GA to assess the NOAA fleet of three WP-3D aircraft in order to manage the fleet into the future. The purpose of this assessment would be to accurately define the service life remaining on its WP-3D aircraft; and to define actions necessary to sustain the aircraft, such as inspections and/or other maintenance, modification, or operational actions and identify the corresponding time frame/flight hours associated with each option. NOAA recognizes that critical portions of the data required for a complete Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) of the P-3 airframe are Lockheed Martin proprietary data. This unpublished and unreleased data has been developed at Lockheed Martin's expense over the years during the development of numerous military and commercial aircraft and was used during the development of the P-3. Some of this data includes but is not limited to: structural analysis methods documented in Stress Memo Notes (SMN's), historical material property test data used in the SMN's, P-3 aerodynamic and flutter models, analysis software such as the SPOT skin panel buckling analysis program, original loads and stress analysis reports developed during the commercial L-188 Electra aircraft from which the P-3 was derived, airframe internal loads derived from proprietary unit beam methodology, and manufacturing material and process specifications.
<p><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the assessment of the WP-3D aircraft to accurately define the service life remaining on the NOAA WP-3D aircraft may submit substantiating documentation in writing within ten days after publication of this notice. Responses can be faxed to Sharon Clisso at (816) 274-6922 or sent via email to Sharon.Clisso@noaa.gov. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>DOC, Eastern Acquisition Division-Kansas City Office requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register, all offerors must have a Dunn &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dunn &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dunn &amp; Bradstreet on-line at http://www.dnb.com/eupdate or by phone at (800) 333-0505.

<DESC>REQUIREMENT: Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Senior Leadership Command, Control, and Communications System (SLC3S) Engineering and Test and Evaluation Support
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>This sources sought announcement is published for market research purposes. This market research will be used to help identify small and large sources in the market. Request that prospective offerors complete and return a Capabilities Statement as described below to determine which contractors possess the capability, experience and financial ability to provide the security operations services. The Government is in no way obligated to do business with or to enter into any form of contract with any person, firm, or other entity that receives or responds to this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) serves as the National Military Command System (NMCS) systems engineer for the Joint Staff and as the Senior Leadership Command, Control, and Communications System (SLC3S) engineer for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Networks and Information Integration (OASD/NII). In direct support of these missions, DISA's Strategic Communications Division, SLC3S Engineering Branch, (Code GE242) provides system engineering for the Survivable Mobile Command Center (SMCC) elements, executive transport aircraft, ground fixed and mobile assets, maritime assets, and the executive travel support teams that provide trip communications for the President of the United States (POTUS), the Secretary of Defense (SECDef), the Secretary of State (SECSTATE), the Combatant Commanders (COCOMS), the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), and other designated senior Government leaders. To ensure that the SMCC elements, SLC3S assets, and the executive travel support teams satisfy the complex, demanding, and dynamic set of operational requirements, it is necessary that: (1) implementation support is provided to ensure that they are prepared to integrate new or upgraded systems and that a smooth transition to new systems is effected, (2) tests be conducted and the results evaluated to verify that system improvements/capabilities actually satisfy operational requirements, and (3) engineering assistance is provided to the SLC3S program offices and the Service O&amp;M agencies to resolve operational problems encountered with SLC3S communications and information processing system interfaces with ground- and space- based communications networks. The engineering, test, and evaluation (ET&amp;E) activities accomplished in this delivery order will assist in the engineering design and development process, estimate and verify the operational effectiveness and suitability of systems, support the transition process, identify shortfalls and needed modifications, and support changes to meet readiness and performance goals.</p>
<p>Due to the requirement for senior leaders to execute their responsibilities wherever they are and because of the DoD-wide migration to Transformational Communications, wideband connectivity to SLC3S platforms is essential. Migrating wideband communications onto SLC3S platforms is of utmost importance in order to ensure that the assets can fully participate in the Transformational Communications concept including Global Information Grid (GIG) NETOPS, Network Centric Enterprise Services (NCES), and the Unified Command Structure (UCS). Throughout execution of this contract, it is necessary to maintain cognizance with the information technology evolution as dictated by the DoD-wide Transformation guidance, other influential DoD-wide programs, terrestrial and satellite communications infrastructure advancements and changes, national policy, and advanced technology trends. Full performance under this contract will require that the aforementioned concepts play an integral part in the development of all technical solutions with the view toward providing to the Services, agencies, and Joint Staff the systems engineering guidance to achieve transformation communications and network-centric full participation by the entire SLC3S and NMCS.</p>
<p>DISA has the responsibility of chairing the Satellite Star (SATSTAR) Working Group, supporting the Northstar Ground Entry Point Working Group (GEPWG), and supporting the SLC3S Governance Structure in direct support of its NMCS and SLC3S engineering missions. In these endeavors, the SLC3S Engineering Branch periodically hosts or supports the various working groups, resolves pertinent action items and provides technical papers and reports on specific subjects of interest to the working groups. GE242 is also the Northstar and SATSTAR systems engineer. As such, it will be supporting the Headquarters, Air Force Pentagon Communications Agency (HQ AFPCA) 844th Communications Squadron (CS) in the planning, engineering, and testing of Northstar and SATSTAR system modifications as well as providing troubleshooting support in conjunction with currently installed systems.</p>
<p>DISA's responsibilities also include supporting the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) 546th Aircraft Sustainment Squadron (ACSS), which is the System Program Director (SPD) for the E-4B aircraft and is responsible for maintaining, updating and/or modifying the aircraft, and its systems/ subsystems to meet the aircraft's mission requirements. As the E-4B's aircraft mission communication systems are developed and fielded, DISA's specialized engineering, test, and evaluation assistance is necessary to ensure that currently installed and potential new systems and/or subsystems installed onboard these aircraft (1) meet given specifications and user requirements, (2) are interoperable and compatible with existing systems, and (3) do not adversely affect the mission capability of the aircraft. DISA also assists in the development of an E-4B communications roadmap that identifies changes in major communications networks and systems and their impact on the E-4B aircraft.</p>
<p>In addition to its primary National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) role, the E-4B supports the transportation requirements of the SecDef and SECSTATE and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) emergency response requirements. Therefore, the E-4B aircraft must adhere to directives from both the Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Transportation (DOT). In both departments, there are ongoing evaluations, testing, and prototyping efforts for upgrading existing and/or installation of potential new communications systems. DISA's continuous evaluation of these efforts is essential for obtaining valuable information for applicability and/or installation on the E-4B.</p>
<p>TASK OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this requirement is to provide the engineering expertise and oversight to ensure that the baseline configuration, upgrades, integration, and test and evaluation of SMCC elements, SLC3S assets, and travel team components provide the President, SecDef, SECSTATE, the COCOMS, CJCS, and other SLC3S principals with the necessary emergency messaging, situational awareness, crisis action, and operational capabilities to fulfill mission requirements.</p>
<p>SCOPE: The scope of this requirement includes, but is not limited to, support of mission communications systems of the SMCC elements, SLC3S elements, travel teams, and communication initiatives by the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), and is to provide technical support to DISA in the mission of performing ET&amp;E. It also includes Northstar and SATSTAR engineering support to the 844 CS and SLC3S, and National C2 messaging support to OASD/NII. It includes participation in investigations, assessments, test, and analyses of Transformational Communications, Network-Centric Enterprise Services, GIG-BE, NETOPS, and other advanced concepts as they relate to end-to-end connectivity to SLC3S and NMCS platforms.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR CAPABILITES STATEMENT: Interested small and large businesses should provide a capability statement to address their ability and experience to perform the tasks associated with the requirements stated below, and submits them to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Corporate Experience: Clearly describe your background, capability and experience providing and supporting mission communications systems as well as engineering, test and evaluation support as described above.

TITLE: Officer Carrying Case

DESCRIPTION: 

This is a request for information only.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  All information received will be for planning purposes only. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information present or the use of any such information. All proprietary information shall be marked as such. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is seeking sources to provide carrying cases to deputized officers. 

Officers are required to maintain possession of the weapon at all times, safely and securely store the weapon to prevent unintentional discharges, unauthorized access, loss, theft and misuse.  To prevent such occurrences, the Program requires a carrying case that must be inconspicuous for air travel and must contain a locking device. The carrying case must be locking containers that could be used to discreetly transport (i.e., move from place to place by hand) a loaded, holstered, semi-automatic firearm with two extra magazines inserted in a double magazine pouch.  The carrying case must be inconspicuous for air travel; lightweight; flexible; durable; transportable; lockable; and resistant or impervious to penetration or cutting by bladed tools or implements.

REQUIREMENTS: 

The DESIRED performance parameters for the new firearm and magazine containment device are as follows:

Weapon to be carried: Compact Pistol (Law Enforcement Model), or similar.

Size: The device must fit inside a safe with the following dimensions, in inches: 6.75H x 14.75W x 9.75D.  

Weight: It is desirable for the case to weigh no more than 4 pounds, empty.

Configuration: The device may be of a type that can be placed inside another container (i.e. travel bag or briefcase) for concealment during transport.

Materials: The interior of the device should be made of a material that will not damage or deface the surfaces of the firearm, magazines, magazine holder, and ammunition, and will not promote corrosion of the metals used in their manufacture. The material should also be resistant to deterioration from exposure to commercially available solvents and lubricants used to clean and maintain modern firearms, and should not pill or shred into pieces that might interfere with the operation of the firearm and/or magazines. 

Penetration resistance: The device should be able to deter an individual of average strength and dexterity for a period of one minute  from opening, cutting or puncturing with bladed tools or implements that include knives, box cutters, razor blades, scissors, nail files, screwdrivers, corkscrews, or pliers, to an extent that allows the firearm and/or magazines to be removed. 


Locking mechanism: The locking mechanism must be enabled by combination lock. It should resist tampering, picking, or removal from the containment device by wrenching, drilling, sawing, prying, pulling, driving, or burning, using tools or implements that include, but are not limited to items currently authorized by the Transportation Security Administration to be carried onboard an aircraft by the public. The lock should not have any protrusion or exposed surface that is capable of becoming lodged, inserted, or caught on the firearm, magazine, magazine holders, and ammunition. The locking mechanism must be capable of being read and/or manipulated from a standing or seated position, in various lighting conditions, including low light.

Additional desirable characteristics: The device should open in a way that allows the condition of the weapon (i.e. seating in the holster, position of the slide) to be determined without having to remove the weapon from it. The device should also allow the contents to move about within and/or be removed without catching or snagging on any fabric, seam, or surface.



INFORMATION SOUGHT:

Potential offerors are invited to describe their capabilities to provide the product as described herein.  All respondents shall provide sufficient supporting documentation to the government to determine if a competitive environment can be established for this effort. This shall include a description of currently available commercial products, as well as the ability to modify existing products or develop new products that could meet the requirements described herein. All assumptions, including any assumed government support, shall be clearly identified.  All information shall be submitted on or before May 6, 2010, 3 PM EST.  All responses shall be emailed to the following addresses: robert.kirzow@dhs.gov; alisha.m.willis@dhs.gov. In addition to the written response, respondents are also invited to provide product samples. The Government will not pay for any product samples provided, nor does the Government intend to ship the samples back to respondents after reviewing. If interested in providing a product sample, please send an email to robert.kirzow@dhs.gov and alisha.m.willis@dhs.gov to obtain all necessary shipping information.

<DESC><p>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought notice only. This is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought notice is to gain knowledge of commercially available repair services that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The USCG Aviation Logistics Center is conducting market research to determine manufacturers and suppliers described as follows: Repair the APS-143C(V)3 OceaneyeTM Maritime Surveillance and Imaging Radar system that is manufactured by Telephonics and utilized on the HC-144A model aircraft. For this sources sought notice the radar system consists of the following sub-systems: antenna pedestal, signal data processor, and receiver-transmitter. All of these components are contained in various racks inside of the aircraft, except the antenna sub-system, which is contained within the radome. Other components associated with this system, but not included in this sources sought notice, are: multi-function display units which are contained in the aircraft cockpit and the Mission System Pallet, and power supplies which are contained in various locations in the aircraft. While failure to provide repaired parts would not ultimately result in grounded aircraft, it does limit the missions the aircraft can perform. Search and rescue missions would be able to be performed at a reduced level of effectiveness, and the law enforcement mission would be even more limited. This radar system provides the capability to detect and track targets at long range for the search and surveillance missions. This requirement is necessary to allow the USCG to maintain the capability to adequately support their deployed aircraft and carry out their assigned missions. The OEM for this radar system is Telephonics Corporation, 815 Broadhollow Road, Farmingdale, NY 11735. The USCG will NOT be able to provide manuals or drawings for this requirement. Interested parties must have access to the OEM data and manuals. Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your repair service, configurations, auxiliary equipment, and options. Also, state the approximate lead-time for acquiring your repair service. Please provide the details and terms of any standard warranty included with the repair service. Indicate whether and how your company has access to the OEM data and manuals. Additionally detail if this radar system has been qualified for use in any DOD or Federal Government Aircraft. The Government believes the applicable NAICS code is 334511 -- Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing. Please respond to the following questions: (1) Is your business a large or small business and how many employees? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act? (4) Is your firm a certified HUBZone firm? (5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? (7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? (8) Do you have other government agencies using the service, and if so which agencies, POCs and contract numbers? (9) If possible, any POCs for civilian users for general usage of service questions. After the review of the responses to this sources sought notice, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities web site: https://www.fbo.gov/. A response to this sources sought notice is not an adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought notice. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. Responses to this sources sought notice shall be faxed to Tonya Bush at 252-334-5427, U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center (MRS), Elizabeth City, North Carolina, 27909-5001 or e-mailed to Tonya.W.Bush@uscg.mil. TELEPHONE RESPONSES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. Responses must be received no later than 03 May 2010 at 3:45 P.M. Eastern Time. Firms responding to this announcement that fail to provide all of the required information cannot be used to help the Government make the appropriate acquisition decisions which is the intent of this sources sought notice. This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this notice. A response to this sources sought notice is NOT a request to be added to a prospective offerors list or to receive a copy of the solicitation.</p>

<p>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado has a Brand Name Only requirement for the purchase of Dell Optiplex 580 Small Form Desktop PC's each with a Dell 22 Inch 2209WA Flat Panel Monitor and Dell Optiplex 580 Small Form Desktop PC's (please see attached for configurations). This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40, 23 March 2010. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334111 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>The USAF Academy has a Brand Name Only requirement to purchase Dell Desktops, Laptops, and LCD Monitors. Dell Desktop Personal Computers, Notebooks, and LCD Monitors have been approved by the 10th Communications Squadron as the standard across the USAFA .mil network. Per AFNetOps Functional Concepts, para 6.5, "Standardization of configurations, processes, and applications across the enterprise, from the gateway to the desktop, will facilitate centralized management, enhance security through configuration control, and save manpower in certification and accreditation, patch implementation, hardware/software upgrades, and asset tracking." Also per para 6.1 "Robust, redundant data paths and nodes with both physical and logical diversity are needed to maximize effectiveness and eliminate single points of failure. This will enable the integration of distributed capabilities, improve real-time detection/correlation of network anomalies, and give the AFNetOps Commander a comprehensive picture of any potential network degradation, outage, or attack. As importantly, it will help the NetOps community better understand the impact of network actions and the war-fighting operations that rely on their support."</p>
<p>This guidance lends itself to procuring, configuring and maintaining one standard platform per network that can be cannibalized if necessary, switched out with no impacts and easily repaired physically or remotely when needed. Also, a single platform is easier to track when products are under warranty.</p>
<p>The Academy server farm is standardized on Microsoft Operating Systems, ensuring continuity of training for our Network Administration staff. Limited platforms enable fast and accurate troubleshooting and reduce training overhead.</p>
<p>Although other brands, such as HP or IBM would meet our need from a technological standpoint, they incur much greater complexity for management and administration, due to the increasing number of discrete hardware platforms and the fact that USAFA has multiple independent networks. In addition, purchasing other brands would not meet the guidance of the AFNetOps Functional Concepts decribed above.</p>
<p>By standardizing on Dell, USAFA is able to manage and administer multiple networks, multiple platforms and the associated training and troubleshooting tasks that are unique to each. Standardizing on Dell to support the machines with Microsoft operating systems enables our desktop technicians to do more with less in an ever-changing technological environment.</p>

<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.

<p>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado has a Brand Name Only requirement for the purchase of Dell OptiPlex 580 Small Form Desktop PC's, Dell Latitude E6400 Notebooks with Docking Station (2 Batteries, + Charger, + Keyboard, and 2 Button Optical Mouse), Dell Professional 1909W Widescreen 19 Inch Viewable Image LCD's, and Dell Precision T5500 Workstations. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40, 23 March 2010. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334111 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>The USAF Academy has a Brand Name Only requirement to purchase Dell Desktops, Laptops, and LCD Monitors. Dell Desktop Personal Computers, Notebooks, and LCD Monitors have been approved by the 10th Communications Squadron as the standard across the USAFA .mil network. Per AFNetOps Functional Concepts, para 6.5, "Standardization of configurations, processes, and applications across the enterprise, from the gateway to the desktop, will facilitate centralized management, enhance security through configuration control, and save manpower in certification and accreditation, patch implementation, hardware/software upgrades, and asset tracking." Also per para 6.1 "Robust, redundant data paths and nodes with both physical and logical diversity are needed to maximize effectiveness and eliminate single points of failure. This will enable the integration of distributed capabilities, improve real-time detection/correlation of network anomalies, and give the AFNetOps Commander a comprehensive picture of any potential network degradation, outage, or attack. As importantly, it will help the NetOps community better understand the impact of network actions and the war-fighting operations that rely on their support."</p>
<p>This guidance lends itself to procuring, configuring and maintaining one standard platform per network that can be cannibalized if necessary, switched out with no impacts and easily repaired physically or remotely when needed. Also, a single platform is easier to track when products are under warranty.</p>
<p>The Academy server farm is standardized on Microsoft Operating Systems, ensuring continuity of training for our Network Administration staff. Limited platforms enable fast and accurate troubleshooting and reduce training overhead.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNSTN), intends to negotiate with COMSOL, Inc.; Burlington, MA, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to provide additional licenses for COMSOL Multiphysics and related modules for use with COMSOL Multiphysics platforms.
<p><br />The COMSOL Multiphysics and Multiphysics add-on modules have been in use at NIST since 2003. It would be prohibitively expensive to replace this software with software of a comparable nature. This purchase will increase the number of licenses for the COMSOL Multiphysics and the RF Module, and add two additional modules, which can only be used with COMSOL Multiphysics software. These additional licenses will serve to support the increasing user base of the product at NIST. <br /><br />Based on recent market research, COMSOL is the manufacturer and sole provider of the COMSOL Multiphysics software, as well as any modules or attachments to the software. NIST is not aware of any other vendor authorized to provide licenses for the subject COMSOL software applications. <br /><br />The following is a description of the items required:<br /><br />COMSOL Multiphysics for All Platforms, Floating Network License for one (1) concurrent user<br />Qty:1 ; Unit: Each<br /><br />Chemical Engineering Module for use with COMSOL Multiphysics for All Platforms, Floating Network License for one (1) concurrent user.<br />Qty: 1 ; Unit: Each<br /><br />RF Module for use with COMSOL Multiphysics for All Platforms, Floating Network License for one (1) concurrent user.<br />Qty: 1 ; Unit: Each<br /><br />Optimization Lab for use with COMSOL Multiphysics for All Platforms, Floating Network License for one (1) concurrent user.<br />Qty: 1 ; Unit: Each</p>
<p><br />The associated NAICS Code is 511210 with a Size Standard of $25.0 million. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to COMSOL, Inc. for this requirement. <br /><br />The following standards of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 apply to this acquisition:<br />1194.31<br />1194.41<br />1194.41</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST and are authorized by COMSOL, Inc. to provide these services may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Keith Bubar at keith.bubar@nist.gov.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Information Services Division, intends to negotiate with Elsevier, Inc.; New York, NY, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, to provide one base year and 2, one-year option periods of subscription services to Compendex on Engineering Village.
<p><br />Compendex on Engineering Village is a database that offers journals and articles published solely by Engineering Village that are critical to the research conducted at NIST. Compendex on Engineering Village is a tool that has been in use at NIST for several years. NIST researchers have consistently published their own journals and articles in Engineering Village so that other NIST researchers are able to collaborate their research efforts. NIST has purchased and has access to journals, articles, and conference proceedings dating back to 1969 in Engineering Village. A tool other than Compendex on Engineering Village would not allow the integration of these existing articles.&nbsp; NIST's research would be lost, and there would be an interruption of service.&nbsp; Furthermore, it would prove to be too costly for NIST to purchase engineering backfile articles from 1969 to the present time through a tool other than Compendex on Engineering Village.</p>
<p>No other source will meet NIST's requirements to have access to Compendex on Engineering Village.<br /><br />The following standards of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 apply to this requirement:<br />1194.22 - Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and Applications<br />1194.31 - Functional Performance Criteria<br />1194.41 - Information, Documentation, and Support</p>
<p>The associated NAICS code for this requirement is 519120 - Libraries and archives, with a small business size standard of $7 million. NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Elsevier, Inc. <br /><br />It is NIST's belief that Elsevier Inc is the only source of Compendex on Engineering Village. Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements&nbsp;of NIST and&nbsp;are authorized by Elsevier, Inc. to provide these services may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source basis with Vernier Software &amp; Technology, LLC, 13979 SW Millikan Way, Beaverton, OR 97005-2886. The Vernier LabQuest Middle School Science Deluxe Package is a hand-held stand-alone scientific laboratory interface with over 50 available sensors/probes including a motion deatector, pH sensor, voltage probe, stainless steel temperature probe, light sensor, dual-range force sensor, gas pressure sensor, hand-grip heart rate sensor, conductivity probe, and magnetic field sensor. NIST has purchased LabQuests for use by the teachers in the NIST Summer Institute for Middle School Science Teachers during the summers of 2007, and 2009, and needs to continue to purchase from the same source so that the new teachers coming into the program in summer 2010 will have the same equipment. Teachers from all four years of the Summer Institute meet together to learn new experiments and teach each other, and must all have the same equipment to make these interactions beneficial to all involved. The Vernier LabQuest Middle School Science Deluxe Package could not be found by any other sources; other companies sell the components in bits and pieces; and NIST must have the complete Vernier LabQuest Middle School Science Deluxe Package. The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) because the Government has not identified any other source that can meet the requirements specified above. Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that clearly and unambiguously demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to provide the Vernier LabQuest Middle School Science Deluxe Package. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for quotation. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br /><br />

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure the modification of the current Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) #SA2429CE for the Hawker Beechcraft KingAir 350CER (B300), N68RF, for the U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), located at MacDill AFB, FL on a sole source basis with AVCON Industries, Inc. The Hawker Beechcraft KingAir 350CER (B300), N68RF, is specially modified to conduct aerial remote sensing operations. The aircraft is currently modified under STC #SA2429CE which describes dual instrument ports that may be fitted with optical glass for operations in the restricted category. Alternately, the STC allows that the ports may be fitted with aluminum pressure plates, or left open but covered with aluminum pressure domes for operating in the normal category. NOAA requires a revision or amendment to the STC #SA2429CE so that the aircraft may also be operated in the restricted category with no glass, no pressure dome, and no pressure plate installed on either, or neither instrument ports. The government intends to acquire the modification to the current STC #SA2429CE under the authority of FAR Part 13, 106-1(b). The government intends to issue a fixed price purchase order to AVCON Industries, Inc. for the modification of the current STC #SA2429CE. AVCON Industries, Inc. owns and maintains the proprietary data associated with the current STC. Because of this, AVCON is the only reasonably available source that can modify STC #SA2429CE for the NOAA aircraft N68RF. This is a simplified acquisition purchase. NOAA requires complete delivery of application materials to the FAA within 30 days of the award date.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses. However, all responses received within ten days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the government. Responses can be faxed to Sharon Clisso at (816) 274-6922 or sent via email to Sharon.Clisso@noaa.gov. A determination by the government not to compete the acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Bay Pines Veterans Healthcare System (Bay Pines VHS) Bay Pines, FL. 33744, intends to negotiate and procure the Aquarius APS Server Software, Aquarius Gate Dicom Router Software, AquariusNET Server Software including Rendering Node Hardware, Aquarius APS Node Hardware and Aquarius Gate Node Hardware, on a sole source basis, from TeraRecon Inc., 2955 Campus Drive, Suite 325, San Mateo, CA 94403-2517. The applicable NAICS is 334111. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source for the required equipment under authority of FAR 6.302-1; that only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. To the best of our knowledge TeraRecon, Inc. is the only company that can provide this vital equipment. The AquariusNET Server, Aquarius Gate dicom router and Aquarius APS system is the only equipment approved for use VISN wide; insuring a Unified Patient List and collective licensing agreement which shares and upgrades the 3D rendering resources of all currently owned TeraRecon advanced visualization investments, to all seven VISN locations. The following are Features/Functions and Descriptions which further clarify Bay Pines VHS Requirements: Feature/Function: Independent Automatic Pre-processing Capability. Description: Automatically applies manipulations and algorithms to DICOM datasets based upon user-defined rules to perform tasks that would otherwise require the time of a technologist or physician. Feature/Function: Thin-client deployment of advanced visualization capabilities such that the rendering and manipulation is performed on the server-side and the required thin-client application supplying the functionality can be loaded on any number of ordinary PC systems throughout the enterprise.  (AquariusNET Server with Aquarius iNtuition Client). Description: Clinical capabilities must include capabilities for performing calcium scoring, vessel analysis, CT cardiac function, soft plaque analysis, brain perfusion, CT/PET fusion, CT colonography, volumetric subtraction (including dual energy CT), breast MR analysis with parametric mapping, CT Lung CAD and CT Colon CAD. Feature/Function: Ability to create user-defined workflows. Description: System automatically generates the specified volumetric views and performs volumetric hanging protocols on specific studies when opened. Feature/Function: Ability to save entire read cases with the workflow steps as a DICOM series to PACS for archival, future reference or subsequent volumetric review and manipulation. Description: Read images are comprised of saved states, clearly marked as having been validated by a clinician or physician, all measurements and centerlines present in these images along with any labeled anatomy.  The entire workflow can be restored and any changes made to these images and objects. Feature/Function: Browser-based volumetric viewer using only JavaScript technology. Description: Delivery of the processed workup as a URL link via e-mail or other means, which opens up a browser-based viewer allowing interactive image manipulation and review saved states, without using Active X technology. Uses only JavaScript and is hence compatible with Windows, Mac, Unix.  Security is SSL (natively supported in the web browser). Feature/Function: Unified patient list from multiple image server databases. Description: Servers are mutually-aware of the DICOM data residing on each server.  A client session connecting to one server is automatically re-directed to the server which has the desired clinical data set, rather than moving the data set to the local server. Feature/Function: Enterprise software licensing. Description: Software licensing model provides the ability to deploy any number of processing and rendering servers to meet the needs of the enterprise, without additional fees for such access or additional support fees when these are deployed.  Allows for multiple facilities to share their rendering capacity (software investment) and utilize surplus rendering capacity from one facility to cover the needs of others during peak times.  Additional increments of concurrent rendering capacity can be purchased. Feature/Function: System architecture and scalability. Description: The ability to increase the capability of the system in an efficient and incremental manner is critical to deploying an enterprise visualization system affordably as needs increase. Feature/Function: Recovery of previous investment value through upgrade conversion. Description: The ability to apply the full value of certain previous advanced visualization purchases to the enterprise visualization software license purchase being considered. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any vendor that believes it can meet these requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within five (5) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. Information can be sent to the Contracting Specialist via e-mail at Alonzo.Jacobs@va.gov. Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the Bay Pines  VHA will proceed with the sole source negotiation with TeraRecon Inc. as noted herein. Cost associated with the preparation and submission of information and/or any follow-up information requests are the responsibility of the vendor and these costs will not be reimbursed by the Government.

<p>Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) is incorporated by reference with the following inserts under (a): "The following three factors (technical, past performance, and price) shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Technical- <br />1. The offeror must provide letters, model-specific configuration instructions or other verification from both Quantitative Risk Management (QRM) and Polypaths confirming that the behavioral modeling software is fully integrated with those applications in accordance with the definition of full integration specified in 3.0 a) of the Statement of Work: Offerors not fully integrated with QRM and Polypaths, in accordance with 3.0 a) of the Statement of Work will not be considered for evaluation.</p>
<p>2. The offeror must list and describe in detail the types of mortgage and mortgage-related instruments processed by the behavioral models in accordance with 3.0 b) of the Statement of Work. If the models also process multifamily loans, CMBS, reverse mortgage, credit cards, and student loans, identified in 3.0 b) as preferred, lists and descriptions of those should be included here. Descriptions of instruments processed by prepayment models should be identified separately from those processed by credit models. In both cases, the offeror should specify the minimum, maximum and mean number of instruments processed by its customers along with approximate run-times for each.</p>
<p>3. For mortgages, the offeror must further list and describe in detail the differentiable characteristics covered by the behavioral models in accordance with 3.0 c) of the Statement of Work. Descriptions of mortgages processed by prepayment models should be identified separately from those processed by credit models. Offerors are encouraged to describe the characteristics at the lowest level of granularity, e.g., if Alt-A mortgages are identified only a low doc/no doc flag that is either "yes" or "no" versus if models are predicated on data that differentiates mortgages with full documentation versus those with no income/stated assets, stated income/no assets, no income/no assets, etc.</p>
<p>4. For agency instruments, the offeror must describe its prepayment modeling and credit modeling methodologies, respectively, in accordance with 3.0 d) of the Statement of Work. If agency instruments are processed at the loan-level and from the Enterprise as well as the investor perspective, identified in 3.0 d) as preferred, details should be included here.</p>
<p>5. For non-agency instruments, the offeror must describe its prepayment modeling, credit and loss severity modeling methodologies, respectively, in accordance with 3.0 e) of the Statement of Work. If non-agency instruments are processed with loan-level data other than that available through Intex, and the linkages to the loan-level database and back to Intex are established in QRM and Polypaths, as identified in 3.0 e) as preferred, details should be included here.</p>
<p>6.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(A)<em> The tax liability is finally determined. </em>The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(B)<em> The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment.</em> A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2in">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<DESC>This notice replaces the previous posting associated with SAQMMA10R0005.  The Department of State (DOS) removed the previous www.fbo.gov posting associated with SAQMMA10R0005 for administrative convenience. DOS still considers SAQMMA10R0005 as an active solicitation and all dates and timelines including the mandatory synopsis period remain in effect.  

DOS  will now consider requests to attend the mandatory preproposal conference received by 4:00pm EDT Friday April 26.  


NOTICE OF PROPOSED SOLICITATION (Posted April 15, 2010)

Worldwide Protective Services (WPS)

The U.S. Department of State (DOS) intends to award a multiple award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract (IDIQ) to up to six (6) qualified U.S. firms. DOS anticipates issuing Task and Delivery Orders under the IDIQ comprised of labor hour / day rate, firm-fixed price, and cost-reimbursement components. 
This IDIQ will satisfy anticipated and unanticipated personal protective, static guard, and emergency response team security service requirements worldwide. The IDIQ focuses primarily on DOS requirements in critical or higher than critical threat areas. The anticipated period of performance is one year with four, one-year option periods (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). The NAICS code for these services is 561612. 

At a minimum, offerors must possess ALL of the following listed below: 
A. A valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance at the time of proposal submission for the base contract. If a firm with a valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance is selected for award of the base contract, the Government will sponsor that firm for the Top Secret Facility Clearance. However, if for whatever reason, within 60 days of contract award, the firm has not been granted an Interim Top Secret Facility Security Clearance, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract. Similarly, if for whatever reason, within 120 days of contract award, a final Top Secret Facility Security Clearance has not been granted to the contractor, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract.; and
B. Have at least two years of experience in managing and operating personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security services programs located in austere and hostile environments overseas (i.e. Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc); and
C. Personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security programs must have a total annual value of at least 15 million dollars; and
D. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating guard forces with at least 100 positions (posts) at each location, in multiple locations (different facilities, cities, states, regions, etc.); and
E. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating long term personal protective security details for executive level dignitaries; and
F. Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating emergency response teams comprised of at least four members.

The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirements contained in the statement of work for each task order awarded under the IDIQ contract. All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass background investigations conducted separately by the Contractor and the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract. Depending on position, all prime and subcontractor employees performing on this contract must possess either a personnel security clearance or a moderate-risk public trust certification, or have been vetted by the Regional Security Office at the U.S. Embassy where performance is requested (for instance U.S. Embassy Baghdad or Kabul). Firms that are not eligible for a facility security clearance are NOT ELIGIBLE for award of this contract as the prime contractor, nor can they be selected as a subcontractor if the positions require a personnel security clearance for contract performance. 

SPECIAL NOTES: 
1) All International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and other legal requirements shall be met at the time of contract award. DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract of a company that is not ITAR compliant. Contractors shall submit proof of ITAR compliance at the time of contract award; and 
2) DOS reserves the right to reject the proposal of any Offeror that the Government of Iraq or Afghanistan deems ineligible for a Private Security Contractor license, or that is ineligible for any reason to operate as a Private Security Contractor in Iraq or Afghanistan. Contractors shall submit proof of their legal ability to perform in any country where they are awarded work.

Anticipated Acquisition Schedule

DOS plans to post the complete Request for Proposal to www.fbo.gov approximately fifteen (15) days after this notice, no paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted, offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit a proposal for the IDIQ contract award along with four (4) task order proposals consisting of three (3) operational programs and a local program management office. The three operational programs include: a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Baghdad, Iraq, a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Kabul, Afghanistan, and a personal protective security service requirement in Jerusalem. DOS intends to award LPMO Task Orders concurrently to firms that are selected for award of an operational task order. Offerors who do not submit proposals for the IDIQ and all the Task Orders will not be considered by the Government for award. Offerors will also be required to submit a completely separate proposal detailing expenses to establish an LPMO in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Under this multiple award IDIQ contract, all offerors receiving awards SHALL propose 100% of the time on all task and delivery order requirements throughout the life of the contract. The Government reserves the right to terminate any contractor for default who fail to conform to this requirement. DOS anticipates contract award approximately sixty (60) to seventy-five (75) days after submission of proposals. As such, offerors shall certify that all proposals SHALL NOT EXPIRE for a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) days after submission to the Government. 

The Question and Answer (Q &A) period opens with the posting of the solicitation (and not before). The Government will allow interested parties to submit questions to the Government up to April 26, 2010; 1:30 PM EDT after the solicitation is issued. DOS intends to address as many of the industry questions as possible during the pre-proposal conference. DOS will post the answers to any questions not addressed during the pre-proposal conference via www.fbo.gov at a later date. Parties attending the pre-proposal conference may submit questions in writing at the end of the conference. Interested parties may submit additional questions up to May 12, 2010; 5:30 PM EDT. DOS will post answers to questions received at the conference and any additional questions via www.fbo.gov. 

Attendance at the site visit/preproposal conference is MANDATORY. DOS will reject proposals received from offerors who did not attend the site visit/preproposal conference. DOS intends to hold the conference in the Rosslyn area of Arlington, VA on Tuesday April 27 and Wednesday April 28. Offerors interested in attending must preregister by Monday 4:00pm Friday April 25, 2010. All interested parties SHALL FOLLOW-UP the e-mail correspondence with a phone call to Thomas C. Lemole at (703) 875-5852 to confirm receipt of the e-mail and to receive additional details and instructions concerning the site visit/preproposal conference. 
No more than three (3) representatives from each firm (to include potential subcontractors) may attend the site visit/preproposal conference. Interested parties SHALL BE READY to give Thomas C. Lemole notice of their interest by providing the name of the representative (s) who will attend the conference, name of the representing firm, address of the firm, telephone number of each person attending and Cage Code of the firm that will be the primary contractor. Each attendee of the conference SHALL PRESENT TWO FORMS OF PICTURE IDENTIFICATION confirming identity. Those representatives unable to present two forms of identification SHALL BE TURNED AWAY at the door. Preregistration is MANDATORY. Interested parties who do not preregister WILL BE TURNED AWAY at the door.

The salary will be negotiated within the listed market value based upon the candidate's past salary, work history, and educational background.</p>
<p><br />A. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>1. MISSION PROGRAM</p>
<p>USAID/West Bank and Gaza is at the core of U.S. Government engagement in the Middle East. In an extraordinarily complex political, policy, legal, and security operating environment, the Mission is committed to work towards the achievement of the U.S. foreign policy objective for a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Through assistance activities in five technical areas --- Democracy and Governance, Education and Youth, Water Resources and Infrastructure, Private Enterprise, and Health and Humanitarian Assistance --- USAID is working with key stakeholders within the Palestinian Authority (PA) to help build the institutions of a viable, democratic Palestinian state living in peace and security with Israel. In addition, the Mission maintains a robust engagement with the non-governmental and private sectors to support diversity and quality in social sector services (health, education) and effective civil society engagement.</p>
<p>2. OFFICE OF PROGRAM &amp; PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OFFICE (PPDO)</p>
<p>The USAID Mission for the West Bank and Gaza (USAID/WBG) manages the overall U.S. assistance program to the Palestinians. This assistance program is an integral part of the U.S. support for the Palestinian-Israeli effort to create and maintain a peaceful co-existence, and as such it reflects the demands of a continually evolving political and economic environment. It is implemented against the backdrop of ongoing conflict and negotiations between the <br />Palestinians and Israel. The USAID program is intended to improve the quality of life of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza; promote a competitive market economy; foster the effective use of scarce resources; promote the development of a democratic society; encourage sound public management and provide emergency or humanitarian assistance when needed. The program has obligated $2.9 billion since 1994 on the WBG development program, including nearly $800 million in FY 2009. In per capita terms, this is one of the largest USAID programs in the world.</p>
<p><br />B. POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>1. BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION</p>
<p>The Supervisory Development Outreach &amp; Communication (DOC) Specialist<br />plays a critical role in assisting the Mission to present itself and its programs in a manner which fulfills the goal of demonstrating to Palestinians the benefits of peace and stability, as well as to keep the U.S. public and policy makers informed of the program they support.</p>
<p>The Supervisory DOC Specialist supports USAID/WBG in the achievement of its objectives by managing the production and dissemination of public information about the Mission's activities for Palestinian and American consumption. High visibility is crucial to the success of the program, and maximum exposure of the Mission's activities to the public is imperative. The Mission is highly scrutinized by senior administration policy makers, Congress and the media (local and international). Information on USAID project activities is often requested by senior official visitors and other individuals with influence in the area of regional politics and development.</p>
<p>USAID West Bank and Gaza (USAID/WBG) shares its messages with its various audiences in five ways:<br />&bull; via story placements with local and international television, radio, print &amp; electronic media; <br />&bull; via web-based communications;<br />&bull; via its outreach programs, including public affairs campaigns, goodwill ambassador program, and other public diplomacy events aimed at reaching both Palestinian and international public and media conveying USAID objectives; <br />&bull; via public information materials prepared for general audiences and visitors; and<br />&bull; via program information prepared for inter-agency audiences.</p>
<p>The Mission's Development Outreach (DO) and Public Information (PI) activities need to expand beyond the management of public events in the West Bank and on press relations with the local media and focus increasingly on program information services to Mission technical teams and the production of public information materials for use within the Mission and with outside stakeholders, including inter-agency counterparts.

<DESC>Q)  The details of the notice seem to indicate that the generator will be for the destination of Fort Irwin, CA but the place of performance shows Natick, MA. Would you be able to confirm the delivery destination for the mobile generator?<BR>A)  The system will be retained at Natick, so all correspondance and contractual documents will be with Natick.  For computing shipping costs of the generator system, the shipping address will be to Ft. Irwin, CA.<BR><BR>Q)  What is the maximum allowed combined dry weight of the generator and trailer?<BR>A)  The trailer should weigh less than 2000 lbs.  So, acceptable weight for traler and generator should be 6800 lbs.

<p>All other information remains unchanged.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />This project is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and is subject to the reporting requirements of the act.<br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation. This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority to use simplified acquisition procedures for commercial requirements provided in FAR 13.5. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a separate written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. The solicitation number is RFQ No. NLM-10-107-CYC. This acquisition is not a small business set-aside and the NAICS Code is 541990.<br /><br />Project Purpose<br />In order to continue to provide leadership within the national research community in the area of software development for image analysis, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is currently revising and updating its open-source image processing application programmers interface (API), known as the Insight Toolkit (ITK). NLM has determined that it is time to revisit the foundations of the toolkit to assure its viability for the next ten years. In the intervening decade since the original design of ITK, computing technologies have made radical advances including the advent of multi-core microprocessors, 64-bit CPU architectures, and a proliferation of graphics processing units (GPUs) capable of general purpose computing. NLM is in the process of funding a major new software release, ITK version 4.0 (ITK-v4), which will take advantage of these emerging computing technologies.<br />We propose a new outreach effort to broaden the user community and deepen the impact of ITK. The objective of this program is to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of revisions and improvements planned for ITK-v4. The emphasis of this new effort will be testing the software framework, broadening application development efforts, and data sharing to promote open science. Awardees under this program will contribute to the redesign process by supplying user requirements during the planning of the revision effort as well as evaluating the new version, ITK-v4, through their proposed projects.<br /><br />Individual ITK development projects under this procurement should not exceed $150,000 in cost nor surpass 1 year in duration. <br /><br />A. Background<br />In 1999, the NLM Office of High Performance Computing and Communications awarded multiple contracts for the formation of a software development consortium to create and develop an application programmer interface (API) and first implementation of a segmentation and registration toolkit, subsequently named the Insight Toolkit (ITK). The original awards included six contractors: GE Global Research, Insightful, Inc., Kitware, Inc., the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Tennessee. The six contractors were partnered with five subcontractors: Harvard University Medical School, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Pittsburgh, Columbia University, and the University of Utah. The period of performance for the original ITK awards began in 1999 and ended in 2003.<br /><br />The resulting system was originally intended for computer-assisted exploration of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Visible Human (VHP) Male and Female data sets. The final deliverable for this group was an open-source software library concentrating on segmentation and registration algorithms, directly released to the public that now helps support research worldwide in image analysis and in other domains.<br />In 2002 and later in 2004, NLM funded outreach efforts known as the program for "ITK Algorithms, Adapters, and Data Distribution" (ITK-A2D2). These programs promoted ITK, tested the ITK API, evaluated the coverage of the algorithm collection, and explored the versatility of the software architecture. In the past, twenty separate awards were made including funding for:<br /><br />Kitware, Inc.

Revising ITK is considered a contribution to the nation's infrastructure through software. Careful thought has been placed on the cultivation and maintenance of this software, assuring developers that the software will remain supported with new releases, bug fixes, and continuing growth. <br />B. A general description of the required objectives and desired results<br />The Insight Toolkit (ITK) is currently available with the release, ITK version 3.16, announced in September 2009 (see the URL: http://www.itk.org). NLM is funding a major revision, ITK-v4, and we are seeking to exercise the new version through a series of 1-year awards to both broaden the user base and evaluate how the new software version performs.<br />The current funded effort for revising ITK (ITK-v4) will concentrate on four (4) areas:<br />1. Revise ITK - revise and restructure the toolkit with the intention of providing better organization, testing, and documentation.<br />2. Accelerate ITK - provide abstractions and infrastructure support to leverage emerging computing technologies and prepare the toolkit for use in the next decade.<br />3. Simplify ITK - ease the use of ITK through additional language bindings, better wrapping facilities, and possibly through restructuring of the software architecture.<br />4. Support for DICOM in ITK - update and revise DICOM facilities within ITK.<br />In order to help provide user requirement information during the redesign of ITK and to provide real working tests for the new version, NLM is seeking proposals for:<br />(A) algorithm validation, data collection, and data processing (with a focus on time-varying data applications such as longitudinal data collections on chronic, degenerative diseases) as well as tools for managing public data collections.<br />The validation data component will emphasize the assembling of test data, including implementation of existing statistical methods and generation of ground truth segmentations or collections that capture human variation, provided that all examples, data, and software tools are compatible with the existing ITK software base.<br />AND/OR<br />(B) contract programming that extends ITK through incorporating additional algorithm families not already represented in ITK or projects that incorporate ITK into software and hardware systems in support of clinical or medical research applications (with an emphasis on multidisciplinary, practical applications not yet coverd by ITK such as microscopic image analysis, ultrasonography, video processing, and other topics).<br />AND/OR<br />(C) contract programming to overhaul and upgrade some valuable or necessary existing applications, examples, or algorithm family within ITK with the express purpose of improving compile and performance testing, enabling streaming for large data, out-of-core computing, promoting thread safety and encouraging multithreaded programming, and leveraging ITK hardware acceleration techniques arising from the new revision.<br />Some example concepts for this work include incorporating ITK with:<br />&bull; Algorithms or families of methods not currently represented in ITK<br />&bull; Haptic or graphical visualization and segmentation assistance using ITK<br />&bull; A dashboard for 3D tumor evaluation, comparison, and validation (for example, a regression testing system for comparing ITK algorithms against manual tumor evaluations) providing regression testing and comparison of publicly submitted algorithms<br />&bull; Multiscale genome to physiological expression segmentation and visualization with ITK support.<br />&bull; Large data, out-of-core data processing applications including image analysis for microscopy<br />&bull; An image analysis framework for comparing algorithm performance which might include measure computer-aided diagnosis tools or biomarker evaluation through ROC analysis<br />&bull; Fast interaction techniques for low-latency visualization and segmentation navigation with ITK<br />&bull; Inner and middle ear modeling and segmentation including mechanical and electro-physiology simulation<br />&bull; Public data storage and deposition libraries and their supporting tools and infrastructure<br />&bull; Heart modeling<br />&bull; Tools for interpolating development and growth using time-varying data<br />&bull; A tumor volume measurement workstation with ITK plug-in capabilities<br />&bull; ITK supportable software for creating PACS research archives with automatic scrubbing and de-identification of patient information across PACS vendors.<br />This is a list of example projects that might be covered under this acquisition. The list is not exhaustive nor does it cover all areas of interest.<br />Multiple awards are expected, and a single group or offeror may receive more than one award for separate and discrete software development proposals. Individual projects are limited to one year in duration and a maximum of $150,000.<br />All deliverables will be released under the existing ITK license as public, open-source software, and so all deliverables must be free from encumbering licenses or restrictions. The funding for this requirement will be made available under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) and all qualification criteria that arise from the use of ARRA funding apply to this requirement.<br />NLM intends to make multiple awards to address these issues. NLM expects the final team to make approximately ten (10) separate awards. The period of performance for these awards is one (1) year.</p>
<p>C. A detailed description of the technical requirements. <br />Integration is considered the key to success for both this contract action as well as the success of the ITK toolkit in general. All offerors should be prepared to work closely with other NLM contractors and with the existing Insight software community. All software deliverables will be checked-in to the current source code control system and vetted through the style checker and regression testing dashboards currently in place.<br />All deliverables will reside in the public domain (either through controlled Internet distribution from the NLM or through a third party electronic publisher), including all source code. As with the VHP data, controlled access to the source code and image processing tools will be through the issuance of no-cost licenses. The licenses are required solely to allow NLM to track the use, distribution, and proliferation of VHP program products. The eventual software developers will be held to high software standards, and extensive documentation for the software tools (including tutorials, manuals, and examples) are required.<br />To meet the fairly rigorous demands of this collaborative software development project, in the case of algorithm-contributing contractors and software interface developing contractors, NLM is applying the following technical requirements:<br />&bull; Strong knowledge of C++ object-oriented programming.<br />&bull; Demonstrated experience with existing software either being ported to ITK or being adapted through a system interface.<br />&bull; Commitment to all software and documentation developed under these contracts being made available as open-source material. All software will be released according to the licensing agreements that apply to ITK.<br />&bull; Commitment to developing software or data collections under this contract under the style rules and architectural design of the Insight Toolkit.<br />The NLM encourages relationships between industry and academia in this development process. A FTE commitment for programming staff from each of the parties in the consortium is essential.<br />Since public distribution of all data and software is a fundamental principle of this project, in the case of data-contributing contractors, NLM requires that the contractor demonstrate, through the text of the proposal, a knowledge and understanding of the issues in distributing medical data including: the use of patient release forms for long-term authorization of data distribution; the scrubbing of metadata to protect patient privacy; and the reformatting of datasets to comply with standard forms of data files for use in medical software applications.</p>
<p>D. Subordinate tasks or types of work.<br />1. Attend a contractor meeting. The contract PI is required to attend and may bring such support staff as needed to participate in a technical software engineering and development discussion. This meeting will take place from June 28, 2010 until June 30, 2010 at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.<br />2. Develop or modify software for use with ITK exhibiting practical clinical applications of the software or its derivative software engineering tools. Particular emphasis will be placed on clinical relevance or biomedical research, multiscale/multidisciplinary applications, and practical exploration of the uses of ITK.<br />OR</p>
<p>Contribute a dataset or data collection to the ITK distribution system that will enhance or improve the ITK offering by supplementing the software with test data for evaluating, validating, and improving algorithm development. The NLM is placing an emphasis on multiscale, multidisciplinary data (such as sensor data that augments volumetric images) as well as time-varying data from longitudinal studies for clinical trials on chronic degenerative diseases or developmental data associated with neural tract imaging and child development. Another area of interest for NLM is a collection of human datasets that demonstrate normal variation across populations<br />3. If providing software not currently in ITK into the Insight Toolkit software base, the successful award winner must also demonstrate the efficacy of the deliverable by contributing a validation test to ITK. This test should measure how well the software performs its designated tasks and demonstrates the software working with multiple computing platforms. Contractors will contribute all test data and testing and validation software to ITK. <br />OR<br />If contributing datasets or data collections, the successful award winner must take all measures necessary to protect patient privacy and to reformat the data as necessary to comply with the requirements for data distribution under the Visible Human Project. <br />4. Move the developed code or contributed data to a public repository and assure its placement in the public domain.<br />5. Contribute documentation, tutorial materials, and courseware.<br />6. Develop examples of proposed algorithms in ITK or provide renderings of all contributed data.<br />7. Perform all software and documentation development under the style guidelines and architectural rules of the Insight Toolkit.</p>
<p>E. Quality Control.<br />In keeping with the practices for the development of the current Insight Toolkit, all software deliverables will be required to pass through the ITK dashboard, the open-source system for regression testing and quality control. No deliverables will be considered acceptable without checking in the software to the source code repository, and cleared through the dashboard regression testing process. All software, including examples, must be accompanied by software tests, both run-time and regression test, suitable for implementation in the dashboard system. All deliverables must pass their own tests as well as not break other tests in the toolkit.<br />Data deliverables will be checked to make sure that appropriate measures have been taken to protect patient privacy or that necessary releases have been secured in order to distribute the data.<br />Coding style will be checked as a part of the testing process. NLM will create a software editorial committee. Representatives from each of the contracted programming teams will comprise the editorial committee. If an offeror submits a deliverable, the representative from that team will be recused from the editorial evaluation of the deliverable. The remaining committee members will review the deliverable, the software style, documentation, completeness, comprehensiveness and coverage of the software tests, and the correctness of the implementation. Approval of the editorial committee will be required before receiving can be entered for any software deliverable.</p>
<p>F. Reporting Requirements.<br />Progress reports will be requested quarterly, and electronic copies of slides, handouts, or documentation will serve as quarterly reports. Weekly teleconferences, videoconferences, or virtual conferences will be held to provide continuing communication among the project team. Attendance at these weekly meetings is highly recommended. Software deliverables will be checked-in to a source code repository and testing of deliverables will be covered in an automatic build and regression testing environment.</p>
<p>H. Period of Performance.<br />The period of performance for this requirement is one (1) year.</p>
<p>I. Deliverables.<br />All deliverables will reside in the public domain (either through controlled Internet distribution from the NLM or through a third party electronic publisher), including all source code. The NLM will use the Visible Human Project rights and data clause with this requirement, claiming ownership of all data and software generated under this requirement, including all source code. NLM intends to place the ITK license on all software and release it in the public domain. The eventual software developers will be held to high software standards, and extensive documentation for the software tools (including tutorials, manuals, and examples) are required. All deliverables will be checked-in to a source code repository.<br />There will be one attendance deliverable. The contract PI is required to attend and may bring such support staff as needed to participate in a technical software engineering and development discussion. This meeting will take place from June 28, 2010 until June 30, 2010 at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>
<p>J. Technical Evaluations.<br />Peer review of the proposals will be accomplished by a Technical Evaluation Group (TEG) in compliance with NIH policy and procedure.<br />The technical evaluation criteria to be applied follow. Subcategories of each evaluation criteria carry equal weight. (Total Possible Points - 100)<br /><br />1. Understanding the Requirement and Technical Approach (scientific, technical, or analytical approach to achieve project objectives, including a demonstrated understanding of potential problems. <br />(35 Points)<br />The proposal must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the requirements of the Statement of Objectives and Research Requirements and describes an approach that will demonstrate the achievement of timely and acceptable performance. The proposal presents a comprehensive statement of the problem, scope, and purpose of the project to demonstrate an understanding of the requirements from a management and technical standpoint.<br />The proposal should describe:<br />(1) a pre-existing algorithm or set of algorithms to be added to ITK;</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>(2) a collection of relevant data and the analysis of that data to be added to the test and validation collection in ITK;</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>(3) documented development of a software system such as software for medical visualization, simulation, treatment planning, computer-aided diagnosis, or microscopic image analysis.</p>
<p>The proposal should describe how ITK and the software system should be integrated.</p>
<p>Specifically the proposal must demonstrate:</p>
<p>(a) Relevance of the proposed application area to the specific areas of interest outlined in the Statement of Objectives and Research Requirements, including the emphasis of the solicitation on 3D (or higher dimensional) algorithms or data suitable for algorithm validation.</p>
<p>(b) The importance of the proposed application area, that is, the potential for its use as part of the Visible Human Project Insight Toolkit. Importance will be judged on the contribution of the datasets, the algorithms, or system interfaces to the broadening of the community of ITK users. Classes of algorithms that are already represented in ITK will be scored lower than methods that are not currently covered by the toolkit. Importance of data collections will be evaluated on the breadth of the datasets proposed for distribution with ITK, the number of datasets and relevance of that data to the medical community. Comprehensive data collections will be preferred over single, unique, specialty datasets. Proposed system interfaces to software products will be evaluated on the perceived impact of ITK on that system, and the relative benefit to the Insight project. Interfacing ITK to software packages with established user communities will help</p>
<p>(c) amplify the contribution of the Insight project among researchers in medical image analysis. Proposals should describe the expected impact of their contribution both to the intended user group, and the concomitant benefit to the Visible Human Project Insight Toolkit.</p>
<p>(d) The demonstrated level of understanding of the image understanding issues and problems related to the proposed application as they pertain to the analysis and processing of medical images.</p>
<p>(e) The demonstrated level of understanding of the software development issues and problems associated with distributed code development among a consortium of programming teams; OR a demonstrated level of understanding of the data distribution issues and problems associated with the dissemination of biomedical data including privacy protection, licensing, copyright protection, and patient consent.</p>
<p>2. Qualifications and Availability of Proposed Personnel (demonstrated evidence of the qualifications, experience, and availability of professional and technical personnel comprising the necessary project staff.)(40 Points)</p>

<DESC>Modification to Previous NoticeApril 22, 2010Solicitation Number: VA-244-10-RP-0210Erie VAMC135 East 38th StreetErie, PA 16504Items to be procured:The requirement is to provide one of the following:Liebert 208 Volt, 60HZ, 3 Phase DS Precision Cooling System: Model DS035WUC0EI543A     "	Nominal 035 kW (10 ton) Water/Glycol Cooled Downflow System withCleanable paradenser heat exchanger with a net sensible cooling capacity of 98,100 BTUH at 72F, 50% RHMust purchase brand name as described and exact model in order to be compatible with current system in place.  This is essential to the government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  The purchase of this unit would preclude Erie VAMC from modifying the existing utility that is already in place, which would cause the Erie VAMC to incur additional costs. Purchasing this unit is compatible with the backup Liebert cooling system already in place and software that has been installed that automatically transfers units when one fails.  Current unit is failing - if the unit fails when the warm weather arrives, the Erie VAMC could be as risk for losing all data on IT servers.   Recent market research indicates that Liebert 208 Volt, 60HZ, 3 Phase DS Precision Cooling System: Model DS035WUC0EI543A is available from Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB's).    This procurement will no longer be pursued as a sole source requirement to Emerson Network Power - Liebert under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  6.302-1 entitled "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;" and will now be procured as a SDVOSB set-aside. The statutory authority permitting SDVOSB set-asides is 38 U.S.C. 8127 (c) of Public Law 109-461 as implemented by the VA Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) 819.7005 entitled, "Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-Aside Procedures."Modification to a Previous Notice was posted to https://www.fbo.gov/ on 04/22/2010 with the expectation that a combined synopsis/solicitation will be issued is no later than 04/23/2010 with intent to award no later than 04/30/2010.Any inquiries and/or requests for solicitation must be submitted in writing to Cynthia Grygier, Contract Specialist at cynthia.grygier@va.gov

The FAA annually obligates more than $3.5 billion in goods and services (over $1 billion a year in support services awarded to small businesses.)  In Fiscal Year 2009, the FAA awarded 29% of the total procurement dollars to small businesses, 9% to 8(a) certified firms, 12% to small disadvantaged businesses, 5% to women-owned businesses and 2.2% to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  In Fiscal Year 2010 (for the period beginning 10/1/09 - 1/27/10), the FAA awarded 30% to small businesses, 11% to small disadvantaged businesses, 6% to women-owned businesses, and 3% to service-disabled veteran-owned businesses.

Workshop sessions will address technical program requirements and business issues as well as provide detailed procurement information that will help increase small business opportunities with the FAA.
Small businesses are encouraged to market their capabilities during the forums with large primes, FAA technical and procurement subject matter experts, and by participating in the Exhibit Hall Trade Show.  Large businesses with major FAA contracts will also be on-hand to provide specific subcontracting opportunities and conduct industry subcontracting/mentor-protg workshops (i.e., SRA International, Computer Sciences Corporation, Serco, Northrop Grumman, Deloitte, Apptis Inc., A3 Technology, Harris, ITT, Tremco Inc., Advanced Management Technology, Lockheed Martin, Parsons, L-3 Communications, Raytheon, B3 Solutions, Veracity Engineering, ISSI, VMD Systems Integrators, Inc., Construction and Service Solutions Corp. and many more.)

<DESC>Introduction:  This announcement constitutes the annual posting of BAA, HQ0147-10-MSTAR-BAA.  The next submission date for submittal of white papers is established as 10 June 2010.  The original announcement language is included below.

Original Posted Information:
The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States (US), as well as US allies and friends from a ballistic missile attack.  The MDA Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost and Early Intercept Phases through Midcourse into Terminal Phase.  MDA efforts are focused on making the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and increasing capabilities to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries.  MDA must have the ability to detect, track, identify and kill the ballistic missile.

MDA Advance Technology Directorate (DV) instituted the Missile Defense Agency Science and Technology Advanced Research (MSTAR) program to fund relevant advanced research at qualified accredited domestic colleges, universities or institutions of higher learning and to support training of future scientists and engineers in the field of missile defense.  This BAA is a recurring, competitive solicitation and contract vehicle to allow DV to identify and acquire emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and advanced algorithms to improve the BMDS capability and fill technology gaps.  

This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d) (2), which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."  Any contracts awarded from this BAA must comply with the International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR).

Proposals are solicited only from eligible domestic accredited colleges, universities or institutions of higher learning registered by the U.S. Department of Education.  Any award resulting from this BAA will be made only to an offeror that is a qualified education institution at time of award.  If the proposal is based on a subcontract or teaming arrangement, the college, university or educational institution submitting the proposal is required to perform 50 percent or more of the effort.  For planning purposes, Firm-Fixed Price or Cost level of effort or completion type contracts are anticipated.  Although subject to official fiscal appropriation and availability, it is anticipated that each MSTAR contract is projected to be funded between $600,000 and $800,000 for a period of two or three years.  Funding ceilings are $300,000 a year during the two year base period of performance with a potential option for a third year of performance funded at a maximum of $200,000.  Inclusion of options in any contract is at the discretion of the Government.  The Government is also not obligated to exercise any option period included in an awarded contract.

MDA requires that lead Principal Investigators of institutions submitting a proposal under this program hold US citizenship. MDA desires that participating students conducting research for or sponsored under this program award, hold US citizenship.  In addition, the Government reserves
the right to request special justification for considering any student who is a non-US citizen, but who holds a valid green card, for participation in research for or sponsored through this program award. Students without valid green cards are ineligible for consideration and participation altogether.

If MDA decides to pursue a concept, the appropriate level of funding will be identified, and a final proposal will be requested by a MDA Contracting Officer in writing.  Funding of research within MDA areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during the budget cycle.  Therefore, those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the MDA technical point of contact, Richard Schwarz, MDA/DVI; 256-955-1835, to determine the likelihood of funding prior to committing resources to preparing a proposal in response to this BAA.  Coordination with the technical point of contact prior to proposal submission allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and avoids contractor and Government time spent on efforts that may have little chance of being supported.  Any awards are anticipated to occur in fiscal year (FY) 2010 through FY 2011. 

Research Topics
MDA/DV is interested in development of advanced technology research in technologies for each missile defense phase encompassing the entire engagement sequence to include Surveillance, Acquisition and Tracking, Discrimination, Communications, Engagement Planning, Threat Engagement, Evolving Threats and Countermeasures, and Kill Assessment.

The Government may use selected Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC), support contractors, and other non-governmental personnel to assist in the evaluation and administrative handling of proposals submitted in response to this announcement.  These persons are bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source selection information.  Additionally non-government employees must disclose all applicable corporate organizational conflicts of interest as well as any personal financial conflict.  Submission of proposals under this BAA constitutes the offerors acknowledgment and consent to the use of contractors during the evaluation process.  

The evaluation team will evaluate and make recommendations for award, based on a peer or scientific review process in accordance with FAR 35.016(d) and (e).  The primary basis for selecting proposals will utilize the below listed evaluation factors by applying the delineated criteria as follows: 
&#8195;
EVALUATION FACTORS AND CRITERIA
MDA will evaluate responses based upon the following five technical factors (weighted equally) and a cost evaluation: 

(1) Scientific and technical excellence of the research and its relevance to MDA goals with special emphasis on innovation, originality, and uniqueness; 
(2) The offeror's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; techniques, or unique combinations of these are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; 
(3) Qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and/or key personnel that are critical in achieving the proposal objectives; 
(4) Ability of the proposed effort to make progress toward demonstrating the feasibility of the concept in accordance with MDA programmatic needs; 
(5) Adequacy of management planning and controls; demonstrated ability to deliver results from research projects, on schedule, on or under cost; and

Cost will be evaluated against the government's estimate of the cost of completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed; total evaluated probable cost consists of the government's estimate of the realistic cost of completing the offerors proposals, to include the government's assessment of program risk, and additional costs to the government such as government-furnished property, government-furnished information, transportation, the duplication of previously awarded contracts submitted by the offeror, similar technology efforts pursued elsewhere and other cost related factors.

The following criteria will be applied to each factor for evaluation of each offerors proposal:
(1)  The scientific excellence and innovative quality of the proposed technology or application; 
(2)  The offerors capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and 
(3)  The relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program, to include maturity and level of risk;  
(4)  Demonstrated ability or clear plan to deliver results from research projects on schedule and under cost.  

No further evaluation criteria will be used.  The government intends to evaluate and recommend awards based upon its evaluation of proposals without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to hold discussions and solicit final technical proposal revisions if deemed necessary.  The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.

Offerors are reminded that this BAA is for the acquisition of advanced technology for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution.  Proposals related to the development of a specific system will be returned as non-responsive.  This BAA covers the fiscal year 2010 and 2011 timeframe.  The next response date for proposals submitted is not later than 10 June 2010.  

Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs (to include those proposals selected for award).

<DESC>NAICS Code: 561920   This amendment is to clarify the response due date of Friday, April 30, 2010
The Office of Air Programs, Stratospheric Protection Division of the Environmentl Protection Agency (EPA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Agricultural Research Consulting for support of the 2010 Methyl Bromide Alternative Outreach (MBAO) Conference. The support will include conference planning, conference organization and inmplementation and distribution of conference proceedings.
The annual Methyl Bromide Alternatives Outreach (MBAO) conference is the only worldwide conference focused on sharing research and field trial experience relating to methyl bromide alternatives. The MBAO conference has been in effect since 1994 and continues to serve as a useful platform for sharing information, as the January 1, 2005 phase out  of methyl bromide has taken effect. The period of performance will be date of award through March 31, 2011.
Only Agricultural Research Consulting has the knowledge and past experience to organize and host a conference on alternatives to methyl bromide in a timely, inexpensive and effective manner that avoids a significant waste of government resources and insures government objectives will be successfully accomplished. First, obtaining conference services from a different source would require organizing a completely new conference from its initial stages. Second, EPA's contribution is joined by that of USDA and other entities towards Agricultural Research Consulting for the MBAO conference. Were EPA to organize and host a conference on its own, the cost of doing so would be greater than the amount EPA contributes to the organization of the MBAO conference. Third, any new conference would not have the reputation or institutional history of the MBAO conference and would not attract the same caliber of presenters or the same attendees.
Due to the nature of this procurement, EPA believes there is only one responsible source capable of meeting these requirements. NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the requirement may submit a response, which is received by COB, Friday April 30, 2010, will be considered. Responses must be submitted in writing via the email link below. No telephone calls will be accepted. The point of contact for this procurement is NIcole Schuller, Contracting Officer, at schuller.nicole@epa.gov.

<a href="mailto:southerland.john@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) will be conducting a follow-on study [the Cleveland Multiple Air Pollutant Study (CMAPS)] to determine the impact of local and regional air pollution sources on air quality in Cleveland, Ohio.  This requirement requiresevaluation of the association between address-level pulmonary and cardiac emergency department health effects data and CMAPS air pollution data including receptor, deterministic, and exposure modeling estimates.  Also, this requirement requires evaluating the impact on health effects estimates of using exposure and source estimates compared to using the data from the GT Craig monitoring site as well as using spatial analysis, time-series, and case crossover methodologies to understand the impact of sources and exposure on health effects.
This action is being pursued on a sole source basis because, The Metro Health System (TMHS), to the best of our knowledge, is the only known source who has collected pulmonary and cardiac outcome data from Cleveland metropolitan area hospitals at the address-level and conducted post-ER visit interviews with patients during the CMAPS study period under EPA purchase order # EP09D000599.  In addition, TMHS is the only known source who has conducted research to characterize the human health impacts of local steel mill activity in Cleveland that meets our professional requirements (peer-reviewed research which has been presented at professional conferences).  Furthermore, only those who are a part of the Case Western Hospital system can have access to data.   Case Western Hospital System will not release health records, emergency room data, or any other data to anyone outside of their system.
NAICS Code 541620 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: John Southerland Jr (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

Contracting Officer: Thomas C. Lemole
email: LemoleTC@State.Gov  
phone: 1-703-875-5852


This notice addresses a typographical error included on page 3, paragraph 3 of the synopsis that states: within three (5) days.  The text now correctly states: within five (5) days.  

NOTICE OF PROPOSED SOLICITATION

Worldwide Protective Services (WPS)

The U.S. Department of State (DOS) intends to award a multiple award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract (IDIQ) to up to six (6) qualified U.S. firms.  DOS anticipates issuing Task and Delivery Orders under the IDIQ comprised of labor hour / day rate, firm-fixed price, and cost-reimbursement components.  
This IDIQ will satisfy anticipated and unanticipated personal protective, static guard, and emergency response team security service requirements worldwide. The IDIQ focuses primarily on DOS requirements in critical or higher than critical threat areas. The anticipated period of performance is one year with four, one-year option periods (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). The NAICS code for these services is 561612. 
At a minimum, offerors must possess ALL of the following listed below: 

A.	A valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance at the time of proposal submission for the base contract. If a firm with a valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance is selected for award of the base contract, the Government will sponsor that firm for the Top Secret Facility Clearance. However, if for whatever reason, within 60 days of contract award, the firm has not been granted an Interim Top Secret Facility Security Clearance, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract. Similarly, if for whatever reason, within 120 days of contract award, a final Top Secret Facility Security Clearance has not been granted to the contractor, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract.; and

B.	Have at least two years of experience in managing and operating personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security services programs located in austere and hostile environments overseas (i.e. Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc); and

C.	Personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security programs must have a total annual value of at least 15 million dollars; and

D.	Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating guard forces with at least 100 positions (posts) at each location, in multiple locations (different facilities, cities, states, regions, etc.); and

E.	Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating long term personal protective security details for executive level dignitaries; and

F.	Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating emergency response teams comprised of at least four members.

The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirements contained in the statement of work for each task order awarded under the IDIQ contract. All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass background investigations conducted separately by the Contractor and the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract. Depending on position, all prime and subcontractor employees performing on this contract must possess either a personnel security clearance or a moderate-risk public trust certification, or have been vetted by the Regional Security Office at the U.S. Embassy where performance is requested (for instance U.S. Embassy Baghdad or Kabul).  Firms that are not eligible for a facility security clearance are NOT ELIGIBLE for award of this contract as the prime contractor, nor can they be selected as a subcontractor if the positions require a personnel security clearance for contract performance.     

SPECIAL NOTES: 

1) All International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and other legal requirements shall be met at the time of contract award.  DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract of a company that is not ITAR compliant.  Contractors shall submit proof of ITAR compliance at the time of contract award; and 

2) DOS reserves the right to reject the proposal of any Offeror that the Government of Iraq or Afghanistan deems ineligible for a Private Security Contractor license, or that is ineligible for any reason to operate as a Private Security Contractor in Iraq or Afghanistan.  Contractors shall submit proof of their legal ability to perform in any country where they are awarded work.

Offerors who do not submit proposals for the IDIQ and all the Task Orders will not be considered by the Government for award.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />Air Education Training Command Contracting
<p><br />I. Contracting Activity<br />Department of the Air Force<br />AETC CONS/LGCI<br />2021 First Street West<br />Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4302<br />(210) 652-8228<br />DSN 487-8228</p>
<p>II. Nature and/or Description of Action Being Processed<br />The proposed commercial contract requires FlightSafety Inc, to provide Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers with King Air 350 Flight Training to include training in a full motion, level "D", fully functional, simulator with six degrees of freedom (roll, pitch, yaw, surge, sway and heave), equipped with the Collins Proline 21 Avionics package. This training also includes additional "Hands-On" maintenance on several sub-systems of the KA350 aircraft, to include specialized training on the Proline Avionics System and sub-systems, and advanced aircraft diagnostics on several aircraft sub-systems such as electrical power, communications, radar, and surveillance systems. This will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.</p>
<p>III. Description of Supplies/Services Required to meet the Agency's Needs<br />This simulator training will provide training for the Beechcraft King Air 350 commercial twin-turboprop aircraft. Training will include Pilot (Initial and Recurrent) to include the following specialized classes, Crew Resource Management, Controlled Flight into Terrain, High Altitude, Managing Fatigue, Line-oriented Simulation Training, Approach/Landing Accident Red. The required training will be contractor-provided, at their commercial facilities, in the Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas. Training is for FMS students in the King Air 350 aircraft level "D" simulator. <br /><br />IV. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition<br />10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p><br />V. Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition requires the use of the Authority Cited above (Applicability of Authority)<br />The Iraqi Government purchased several specially modified King Air 350 aircraft under FMS case ID-D-SAA and follow on pilot training was purchased through AETC CONS/LGCI under contract FA3002-09-C-0008. Several Iraqi students received training under the original aircraft purchase contract and the follow on pilot training contract from FlightSafety. The IqAF would like all pilots to receive the same training, to include a level "D" full motion simulator equipped with the Proline 21 avionics package. An extensive internet search resulted in three (3) companies that currently operate a level "D" full motion King Air 350 simulator. FlyRight Inc. located in Concord, North Carolina, CAE in Dallas, Texas, and FlightSafety, in Wichita, Kansas. Only FlightSafety's Level "D" simulator is equipped with the Proline 21 avionics package.</p>
<p>VI. Description of Efforts made to ensure that Offers are solicited from as many potential Sources as deemed practicable<br />Similar training was awarded by AETC CONS/LGCI in Sep 2009, with the period of performance ending in Dec 2009. Contract FA3002-09-C-0009 was awarded on a sole source basis to FlightSafety Inc in the amount of $274,005.00. This current requirement is for the exact same training for additional students. Additional market research was performed based on a review of the previous requirement. An extensive internet search was conducted along with a Dynamic Business Search on the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Web site. A Sources Sought Notice was also posted on the FedBizOpps web site for the original requirement on 26 Apr 09. The Internet search resulted in three (3) companies that currently operate a level "D" full motion King Air 350 simulator. FlyRight Inc. located in Concord, North Carolina, CAE in Dallas, Texas, and FlightSafety, also in Dallas, Texas. Only FlightSafety's Level "D" simulator is equipped with the Proline 21 avionics package. The Dynamic Business Search only turned up one additional source, Global Jet Services, Inc. in Weatogue, Connecticut. This company was contacted and replied that they only offer the maintenance training on the King Air 350 and not the pilot training. They were contacted again in February 2010 to confirm they still did not offer the pilot training. They responded that they still currently do not offer pilot training but they are looking into offering the training in the future. There were two responses to the original Sources Sought Notice that was posted on FedBizOpps. One was from Fidelity Flight Simulation in Pittsburgh, PA. They stated that they could provide a full motion KA350 simulation, but not in a level "D" simulator and not with the Proline 21 avionics package. They were contacted again in Feb 2009 and stated they still could not provide a level D simulator. The other response was from FlightSafety Inc, which can meet all requirements at either their Kansas or Dallas facility. In Accordance with FAR 5.2, a notice was publicized on FedBizOpps of the intent to award this requirement as a sole source set-a-side on 4 Mar 10.</p>
<p>VII. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable<br />The cost of this acquisition will be determined fair and reasonable by the Contracting Officer. FlightSafety currently holds several contracts with the US Air Force and several other Government Agencies. These contracts will be compaired to the proposal received from FlightSafety for this requirement and the pricing will be compaired to similar aircraft already under contract. Justification of price reasonableness will be documented in the Official Price Negotiation Memorandum.</p>
<p>VIII. Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of Reasons Market Research was not Conducted<br />In addition to the sources sought notice posted on the FBO web site, extensive research was conducted using the AF EZQuery database, the World Wide Web, and the industry's trade publications, i.e., Training &amp; Simulation Journal. This market research resulted in three (3) companies that currently operate a level "D" full motion King Air 350 simulator: FlyRight Inc. (Concord, North Carolina), CAE ( Dallas, Texas) and FlightSafety (Dallas, Texas). Only FlightSafety's Level "D" simulator is equipped with the Proline 21 avionics package and meets the customer's full requirement.</p>
<p>IX. Other Facts Supporting the use of Other Than Full and Open Competition<br />None.</p>
<p>X. List of Sources, if any, That Expressed Interest in the Acquisition<br />FlyRight Inc.<br />Fidelity Flight Simulation Inc.<br />FlightSafety International Inc.<br />CAE USA Inc.<br />Global Jet Services</p>
<p>XI. Statement of Actions to Remove/Overcome Any Barriers to Future Competition.<br />AFSAT and AETC CONS/LGCI will continue to perform market research for any future training requirements. Those interested vendors will be informed of any future requirements for KA 350 pilot training and AETC CONS/LGCI will continue to post future requirements to Federal Business Opportunities.</p>
<p>XII. Contracting Officer's Certification<br />The contracting officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document evidences that he has determined this document to be both accurate and complete to the best of her knowledge and belief (FAR 6.303-2(a)(12)).</p>
<p>XIII. Technical/Requirements Personnel's Certification<br />As evidenced by their signatures on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete (FAR 6.303-2(b)).</p>

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open CompetitionThis sole source justification is being submitted by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), National Cemetery Administration (NCA), Construction Support Division (CSD), 811 Vermont Ave NW, Washington DC 20571, for a project at Fort Scott, Kansas.Solicitation VA-786A-10-RP-0036 is stimulus project for roadway repair including resurfacing and new curb and gutter, at the Fort Scott National Cemetery, in Fort Scott, Kansas.  The request is for this  solicitation to be sole sourced in accordance with PL 109-461 and the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. 657f), to a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) . Fort Scott National Cemetery is a small historic cemetery located in rural eastern Kansas.  Currently there are two ongoing projects at the cemetery, both are currently shut down for the winter months.  One is to replace the historic wall that surrounds the original cemetery.  The other is a turf renovation project.  Since the cemetery is small the staging/storage area for contractor's equipment and material is limited.  The proposed road improvement project would introduce another contractor to the site, and a fourth project to repair and expand the irrigation system could introduce a fourth contractor to the already busy cemetery.  The larger problem with the irrigation and road projects is the fact that the main lines for the new irrigation system are in the roadway, which is to be repaired and/or resurfaced under this project.  The irrigation and the road projects need to be coordinated very closely, and with two different contractors performing the projects it may be a logistical nightmare for the Cemetery Director and his staff.  The onsite staff at the cemetery consists of three people.  Also we do not have a resident engineer on this project, so there is no VA presence to work out day to day problems that will arise between the different contractors. I have spoken to the Project Manager Dennis Gerdovich, the Memorial Service Networks Engineer, Rodney Duich, and the Cemetery Director, William Owensby; they all agree that it would make a bad situation even worse if we were to introduce additional contractors to the site, given the fact that there is no resident engineer to coordinate the work of the different contractors.  I recommend using the same contractor that will be doing the minor irrigation project, to insure proper coordination between the irrigation project and the stimulus road project.  We do not want to resurface the roads and in a month or two tear up the new pavement to install water lines.  I also recommend that this contractor is a SDVOSB.      There have not been any written expressions of interest in this project, but it will be advertised, as required, on FedBizOpps.Sole sourcing to a SDVOSB at this particular time, is in the best interest of the Government.To the best of my knowledge and belief the facts as stated above are true and correct.Michael J HannumContracting Officer

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRSJustification and Approval For Other Than Full and Open Competition1. Contracting Organization: Department of Veterans Affairs, Acquisition Service Area Office (ASAO) East - 8, VA Caribbean Healthcare System, San Juan, Puerto Rico.2. Description of Action: This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of design-build services to renovate an existing leased building in order to establish the new VA Comerio Rural Clinic at Coined, PuertoRico. VA intents to negotiate and award a firm-fixed price, sole source, contract with MTC Taller 34, a VIP database registered Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Company. Government estimate is $ 277,000.00. Requirement will be synopsized in accordance with FAR Part 5.3. Description of Supplies or Services: Contractor will develop as-built drawings, develop design, construction documents, construction cost estimate, and construction for the project at the VA Comerio Rural Clinic in accordance with the approved VA conceptual plan; all to be designed according to latest Federal standards and regulation and the Community Based Outpatient Clinic VA Design Guide, Life Safety Code Standards, Handicapped Accessibility Standards and all other federal government standards and regulations. This project will renovate approximately 1,260 gross square feet on the first floor of an existing building (annexed to the Major Office) located in Cuba Libre Street intersection Munoz Rivera Street, Comerio, Puerto Rico.4. Statutory Authority:	( ) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;( ) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;( ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;( ) (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4(X) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;( ) (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;( ) (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;5. Validity of Use of Statutory Authority: The timeframe for the renovation of an existing building for the opening of the new VA Comerio Rural Clinic at Comerio, Puerto Rico is under a tight schedule. VA is required to complete the renovation and open the clinic by May 2010. There is not enough time to request competitive proposals under a set aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns, comply with the time frames set by regulations, and be able to have the work completed by May 2010 as required. The only viable way to be able to accomplish this is to use the authority under the Veterans First Contracting Program to award sole source contracts to registered SDVOSB concerns under certain conditions. MTC Taller 34, a VIP database registered SDVOSB, has been determined to be a responsible contractor with the experience and capability to complete the work in the allotted time. Contractor is registered in the CCR.6. Actions to Promote Competition: This is a one time action.7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price: The anticipated price to the Government is $ 277.000.00. Contractor's proposal will be evaluated against the estimated cost. Negotiations will be held, if required, in order to reach a fair and reasonable price.8. Market Survey (FAR 10): MTC Taller 34 was selected since the company has the personnel that recently completed the build-out for a similar VA rural clinic at Utuado, Puerto Rico. Company was contracted by the Lessor of this4acility. Performance was excellent and project was completed on time, allowing the Government to open the clinic as scheduled. Contractor is very knowledgeable of VA procedures and requirements as demonstrated in previous work.9. Other Considerations: None10. Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: Refer to paragraph 5.11. Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: None. This is a one time action.12. Requirements Certification: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my  cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the hest ofy knowledge and belief.	 _______/S/______________ Jaime MarreroChief, Facilities Management Service (FMS) A Caribbean Healthcare System (VACHS)Date: 1/22/1013. Approvals in accordance with FAR 6.304 Contracting Officer's Certification: (required) I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.________/S/___________				 	Hector J. RiosContracting OfficerAcquisition Service Area Office East - 8 Construction Contracting Branch IDate: 1/22/10
