<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole-source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) hereby announces its intent to award a sole source contract to Sequoia Foundation, 2166 Avenida De La Playa, Suite D, La Jolla, CA 92037-3238 for the Development of Newborn Screening Quality Assurance Materials. <br /><br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541690, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services, with a size standard of $15,000,000.00. The period of performance for this procurement is 60 months from the date of award.
<p>The Sequoia Foundation is the only organization with a partnership with the California Department of Public Health that will allow CDC to obtain blood, with appropriate consent, from people who have newborn screening conditions or their parents. This blood is to be used by the CDC Newborn Screening and Molecular Biology Branch (NSMBB) to create newborn screening quality assurance materials.</p>
<p><br />The California Department of Public Health Institutional Review Board (IRB) names Sequoia Foundation as the administrative point of contact and project partner. There is no other organization identified in the IRB that would be able to partner with California Department of Public Health to do the blood collection. To get another organization approved at the state level to collect the blood would take 12-18 months. Since 2011, CDC has worked with the Sequoia Foundation to receive blood from more than 100 patients with cystic fibrosis or their parents. These blood samples have successfully been used to create newborn screening quality assurance materials for cystic fibrosis newborn screening tests. The foundation's relationship with the California Department of Public Health, is uniquely able to provide access to a diverse set of specialty clinics and a population of people who have newborn screening conditions or their parents. The CDC seeks to expand its request of the foundation to collect blood from people who have any of the newborn screening conditions listed on the HHS-endorsed Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) or their parents. No other vendor can fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps.com. We will only issue a solicitation to Sequoia Foundation. However, all responsible sources who believe they can meet these requirements, may submit their capabilities and/or qualifications statement to Tonya S. Justice, Contracting Officer, via email to TJustice@cdc.gov, no later than 12:00pm eastern standard time on February 21, 2018. Reference solicitation number RFP #2018-N-67780 in the subject line of the email.</p>
<p><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and is solely in the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________<br />Note: Executive Order (EO) 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal<br />Contractors, applies to all contracts subject to the Service Contract Act for which the contract is awarded (and any solicitation was issued) on or after January 1,<br />2017. If this contract is covered by the EO, the contractor must provide employees with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work, up to 56 hours of paid sick leave each year. Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their own illness, injury or other health-related needs, including preventive care; to assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is ill, injured, or has other health-related needs, including preventive care; or for reasons resulting from, or to assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is the victim of, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections under the EO is available at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.41 per hour or $176.40 per week or $764.40 per month</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE EO 13706: $4.13 per hour, or $165.20 per week, or $715.87 per month*</p>
<p>*This rate is to be used only when compensating employees for performance on an SCA- covered contract also covered by EO 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal<br />Contractors. A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA obligations for any<br />paid sick leave provided pursuant to EO 13706.</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor; and 3 weeks after 8 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same<br />Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or <br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **</p>
<p>An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This includes work such as<br />screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives,<br />and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder.<br />All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives. Demilitarization,<br />modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive<br />ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations involving re-grading<br />and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like;<br />minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.

<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1),<br />dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE, Standard<br />Form 1444 (SF-1444) **</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR<br />4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor<br />prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final<br />determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which<br />shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day<br />of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure<br />to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested<br />parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the<br />date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act<br />and this contract. (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are<br />included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage<br />determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the U.S.<br />Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the<br />contractor.</p>
<p>6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy<br />of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See<br />29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties<br />requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage<br />determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination (See 2</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>SECTION M--EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD</p>
<p>M.1. AWARD DETERMINATION</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items.<br />As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows: <br />EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Contractor Experience with this type of work &amp; Key Personnel - Identify key personnel and provide experience with this type of work - Complete the attached Questionnaire with additional information as necessary.<br />2. Past Performance- Provide 3 References with contact information<br />3. Quality Control Plan-See C.11. of Specifications</p>
<p>Price</p>
<p>Cost/Price is of equal importance compared to the technical criteria which includes the experience with this type of work, past performance and quality control plan. However, the importance of price may become greater as the difference between price and the technical criteria decreases. Where the technical evaluation criteria are substantially equal, price may control award. All technical criteria are essentially equal in importance to each other.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
