<DESC>The Vehicle Management and Operations program provides management of the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) fleet of approximately 864 vehicles as well as maintenance for the Air Force owned vehicles. The contractor is required to provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items, except that which is designated Government Furnished Property, and the services necessary to manage and perform vehicle maintenance, operations and analysis. Vehicles included in this fleet are general purpose, special purpose, construction, base maintenance, material handling, non-registered vehicles and equipment. The contractor will manage the U-Drive services and provide base taxi service, bus service/shuttle, cargo movement, protocol support and other associated services.
<p>The contractor manages the maintenance and operations of general, special purpose, construction, base maintenance vehicles and material handling equipment affecting every organization on WPAFB. A portion of this contract calls for the management of the U-Drive services, base taxi service/shuttle, cargo movement, and transportation support for the many distinguished visitors, Air Force teams, aircrews, and conference attendees traveling to the base for meetings here and in the near vicinity of WPAFB. Performance of timely and high quality maintenance and efficient operations management is critical to the day-to-day support of the base.</p>
<p>We anticipate awarding a commercial, firm fixed price contract with a period of performance of 1 Oct 10 - 30 Sep 11, with a transition period of 1-30 Sep 10 and three option years. The competition will be full and open. The Government plans to use a performance price tradeoff source selection, with mission capability, past performance, and price being the evaluation factors. Mission capability and past performance will be approximately equal in importance with price being somewhat less important. Offerors are cautioned that award may not be made to the offeror submitting the lowest cost. The place of performance will be Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433.</p>

<DESC>Using the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process, the Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) is soliciting technical and cost proposals to conduct the 6.2 Research and Development in the following topic of interest: Future Affordable Turbine Engine (FATE) Advanced Mechanical Systems Technology. The proposals are required to be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein. This Announcement constitutes the only solicitation. There will be no formal Request For Proposals (RFPs), other solicitation requests, or other information regarding these requirements.  INTRODUCTION: The Army is anticipating the development of a new centerline turboshaft engine for use in current and Future Force rotorcraft.  This effort, known as the FATE program, will demonstrate advanced turboshaft engine technology in a 7000 horsepower class engine. The FATE program will be conducted under the Department of Defense/National Aeronautics Space Administration/Department of Energy (DoD/NASA/DOE) Versatile Affordable Advanced Turbine Engine (VAATE) program and will consist of a five-year technical effort beginning in Fiscal Year (FY) 12 to demonstrate a reduction in specific fuel consumption (SFC), an increase in shaft horsepower to weight ratio, a reduction in production and maintenance cost, and a design life of 6000 hours.  In order to meet the aggressive goals of the FATE program, significant advancement in mechanical systems technology will be required.  The aggressive performance goals of the FATE program dictate a need for increased rotational speeds, temperatures, and pressures.  These conditions create significant challenges for the individual mechanical components within the turboshaft engine.  The higher rotational speeds will result in greater centrifugal forces, creating durability and damage tolerance challenges.  Additionally, the development of seals, bearings, rotor support systems, and lubrication systems that tolerate the increased cycle temperatures, pressures, and speeds while maintaining minimal weight and performance penalties will be a substantial challenge.  Therefore, the objective of this announcement is to develop and validate critical advanced mechanical systems technologies that improve the performance, durability, and/or affordability necessary to enable FATE technology level turboshaft engines. This program seeks to advance the Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of candidate FATE mechanical systems technologies from a TRL 2 to a TRL 4.  TRL 2 is defined as developing the technology concept and/or application, while TRL 4 is defined as having completed component validation in a lab environment. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:  It is the Governments desire to conduct a technology development effort focused on advanced mechanical systems technologies for FATE technology level turboshaft engines.  The program shall utilize a notional FATE turboshaft engine design to establish the operational requirements and potential payoffs of the proposed concepts relative to the FATE engine performance, cost, and durability/life goals.  The notional FATE engine should be a free shaft engine and designed to achieve the following goals that are based on a configuration that does not include a reduction gearbox, but does include an inlet particle separator: 0.32 Specific Fuel Consumption (based on 7000 SHP engine @SLS, IRP point); 9.7 Horsepower to Weight ratio @ IRP (7000 SHP); greater than or equal to 6000 hours design life, 15000 cycles cold parts, 7500 cycles for turbine blades and combustor liners (to crack initiation); 125 $/HP per engine production cost (including control system and IPS); 45% Reduction in maintenance cost in $ per engine flight hour (relative to Offerors proposed baseline); 20% Reduction in development cost (relative to Offerors proposed baseline); Efficient operation at part power is desired. Note:  For engine level goals, specific fuel consumption, horsepower to weight and life are weighted higher than development, production, and maintenance cost. The Offeror shall define the anticipated mechanical systems configuration and performance characteristics consistent with their FATE design.  The Offeror shall design, fabricate, and perform validation testing of the proposed mechanical systems technologies considered critical to their envisioned FATE goal achievement.  Validation testing shall be conducted at the bench and/or rig level in an environment that simulates notional FATE engine operational conditions and shall be performed to validate rotor dynamic, thermal, and/or mechanical performance. The Advanced Mechanical Systems Technology Program will be an integral part of the DoD/NASA/DOE VAATE program.  Although a Government approved Advanced Turbo Propulsion Plan (ATPP) will eventually be required for any successful Offerors, such a plan is not required in order to be eligible for an award under this solicitation. DELIVERABLES:  All agreements will require delivery of the following data items: (1) Program Plan (delivered 45 days after contract award), (2) Design Review Briefing Charts, (3) Test Plans, (4) Quarterly Progress, Cost, and Performance Reports, (5) Final Report, (6) Final Briefing at Fort Eustis.  All deliverable data may be in the format of selected Offeror(s). SECURITY REQUIREMENTS: Unclassified, subject to export controls. Performance will require access to and/or generation of technical data, the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec. 2751 et. seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended, Title 50 U.S.C. App 2401 et seq. Prior to award, the successful Offeror(s) will be required to provide an Export-Controlled DoD Data Agreement certification number issued in accordance with DoD Directive 5230.25. This certification may be requested from the Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FBA Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI    49017-3084, Telephone 1-800-352-3572. DATA RIGHTS: The Government desires, at a minimum, Government Purpose Rights (defined at DFARS 227.71), to all technical data and computer software to be delivered. The proposal shall clearly acknowledge or take exception to the Governments desire for Government Purpose Rights. DESIRED PERFORMANCE PERIOD: Efforts should not exceed 36 Months total (33 technical and 3 for Data/Final Report). EXPECTED AWARD DATE: August 2010.  If no meritorious proposals are received, the Government reserves the right to make no awards. The Government reserves the right to select for award only a portion of an Offerors proposal (i.e. certain tasks vs. total program).  ANTICIPATED FUNDING: The Government Funding for the program is $1,600,000 distributed by fiscal year as follows: FY10/11-$500K, FY12-$500K, FY13-$600K.  GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT, PROPERTY, AND DATA: Government furnished equipment, property, and data are not anticipated to be required. However, it is the Offeror's responsibility to identify, coordinate, and furnish supporting documentation for use of any Government furnished equipment, property, or data. TYPE OF FUNDING INSTRUMENT: Due to the commercial application of this technology, the Government anticipates an award of a Technology Investment Agreement (TIA) (Cooperative Agreement under 10 U.S.C 2358) or Other Transaction (OT) for Research (10 U.S.C. 2371) which are more flexible than traditional Government funding instruments. Under TIAs or OTs, it is DoD policy to obtain, to the maximum extent practical, cost sharing of half of the cost of the project to ensure the recipient has a vested interest in the project's success. TIAs with, to the maximum extent practicable, cost participation of 50% are anticipated because the technology has dual-use potential and performers of the program will benefit from commercialization. Cost participation may be in the form of cash or in-kind contributions, where cash is considered of significantly higher quality in demonstrating commitment to the project. Cost participation will be considered in accordance with the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, DoD 3210.6-R 37. DoD 3210.6-R paragraph 34.13 (Cooperative Agreement) but also see paragraph 37.530 pertaining to OT.  SIZE STATUS: Due to the complexity and technical considerations of this program, this solicitation is not set-aside for small businesses.

<DESC>THIS IS AN AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) ACTION.  
 
DESCRIPTION: RECOVERY  This is a PRESOLICITATION SYNOPSIS. The USDA Forest Service, Stanislaus National Forest (hereafter "the Government," "the Forest Service," or "the Stanislaus National Forest (NF)"), announces a requirement for reconstructing of Forest Roads 01S01Y, 01S01YB, 01S11, 01S13Y, 01S16Y, 01S56Y, 01S59, 01S61Y, 01S70, 01S71, 02S30, 02S40, and 02S87. The reconstruction includes reconditioning of roadbed, adding waterbars, aggregate base, hot bituminous plant mix, rolling dips, rocked dips, riprap, lead off ditches, curve widening, metal end sections, corrugated metal pipes, ditches and berms, removal of berms and ditches, removal of trees and stumps, cleaning and clearing of culverts, channel repair, ditch maintenance, and clearing and grubbing of those roads as shown on the plans. There is a Limited Operating Period affecting reconstruction on roads 01S71 and 02S87. The work includes the furnishing of all labor, equipment, supervision, transportation, lodging, supplies (except those designated as Government furnished), and incidentals to perform all work required under the terms and conditions of the resulting contract. Funds from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) will be utilized for this project. This acquisition is being advertised as a set aside for Emerging Small Business concerns and any resultant contract award will be issued pursuant to FAR Part 19.10. In accordance with FAR Part 36.204(d), the estimated magnitude of construction is between $250,000 and $500,000. Contract period of performance time is 90 calendar days after issuance of the notice to proceed. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237310. The Small Business Administration size standard is $33.5 million. Contractors are required to be actively registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis, the pending solicitation or any follow up information requests. The solicitation with supporting documents (if any) will be posted to the FedBizOpps website on or about April 17, 2010. No hard copies of the solicitation, supporting documents and applicable amendments, if any will be provided. To receive the entire solicitation package and any applicable amendments, prospective offerors must download them from the FedBizOpps website. This project is located at 19777 Greenley Rd, Sonora, CA 95370, in the county of Tuolumne. The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract.  A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of offers for this procurement. The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked. The Forest Service will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price. Technical factors consist of past experience, past performance and technical approach. Technical factors when combined are approximately of equal importance when compared to cost or price. Therefore, the offeror's proposal should contain the offeror's best terms.

<DESC>Introduction and Background 

The contractor shall apply DeltaDust to burrows in designated prairie dog colonies on the Wall Ranger District of Buffalo Gap National Grassland and Badlands National Park for sylvatic plague abatement.  For each fiscal year, dusting can start as early as 1 April but all designated colonies must be completed by 30 September of the same fiscal year.  

Sylvatic plague was discovered on the Wall Ranger District in May 2008.  A large-scale dusting effort resulted between four different agencies in an attempt to protect habitat for the endangered black-footed ferret.  A total of 11,239 acres consisting of 543,560 burrows were dusted in 2008 over a period of three-and-half months.  In 2009, a combination of federal agencies and a private contractor dusted basically the same acres.  Plague is still active in the area and nearly the same acreage is planned for dusting in 2010. 

SCOPE OF WORK

The contractor shall dust all burrows in designated prairie dog colonies.  Designation of colonies and subsequent acres to be dusted will vary on a yearly basis depending on funding and plague movement in the area.  A minimum of 500 acres will be designated in 2010 but could be adjusted as high as 20,000 acres depending on funding.  Subsequent years could be as high as 20,000 acres or as low as zero.  Most, if not all work will be conducted in the Conata and Scenic Basins on the Wall Ranger District and select colonies in Badlands National Park (Exhibit 1).   

The Contractor shall be licensed, registered and certified by the State of South Dakota, to provide pest control services in all the categories specified in this contract.  All Contractor employees who apply pesticides in any form shall be certified by the South Dakota Department of Agriculture in the appropriate category of service (Category G and 9).

<DESC>Subject to final approval, The Internal Revenue Service, National Office of Procurement, intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, to Bloomberg Financial L.P., 731 Lexington Ave., New York, NY 10022 for three (3) Bloomberg Professional Service subscriptions, for a base and four (4) option years each. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.

Bloomberg Professional is a subscription to access Bloombergs repository of financial data on its internet site. Pursuant to the subscription, Bloomberg Professional provides access to real time and historical market data for Equities, Futures, Options, Fixed Income and Currency Markets, historical dividend information, over the counter pricing from leading brokers, pricing data for oil and gas markets, financial data about foreign corporations and foreign stock prices, calculators to help price commodity swaps and options, credit default swap fundamentals and pricing, forward curve analytics, tools for calculating yield, spread, option-adjusted spread and total return, global foreign currency news, and other financial data and tools.

The Bloomberg Professional service is access to an online data suppository; therefore, deliverables include data queries including stock and bond issuance and pricing details, derivative values, derivative pricing models, foreign currency rates, market prices for securities traded outside of U.S. markets, and a mechanism to download financial data into Excel.

In support of the IRSs Fiscal Year 2010 Strategic Plan, IRS Field Specialists is committed to improving tax compliance, enhancing our ability to develop solutions for international compliance, and capitalizing on technology to improve our performance. 

Bloomberg is the financial service used by many of our taxpayers and is the most comprehensive financial service available. Bloomberg is the only service that will provide access to a full range of global financial data. Such data is crucial to Financial Product (FP) Specialists in the examination of complex financial product transactions. 

Access to Bloombergs global suite of global financial data and pricing tools will assist FP Specialists to check taxpayers pricing of sophisticated financial instruments and to target areas of compliance risk. Further, because many of the larger taxpayers FP Specialists examine price their financial products based on data in Bloomberg, FP Specialists need access to the same data upon which taxpayers may have relied.  A sole source is intended for this order; no other source is known that is fully capable and available to provide the required services.

Interested respondents shall demonstrate the capability to provide the same level of service, including user training, in a manner as cost effective as procuring services with Bloomberg. IRS will consider all affirmative responses received no later than 10 days after publication of this notice. Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show how it would be advantageous to the Government to switch providers for this requirement (i.e. software costs, training for employees, contingencies, and professional environment). A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. No solicitation document is available.

If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, and that it is more advantageous to the Government, the IRS intends to negotiate a sole-source award to Bloomberg Financial L.P.
A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The intended period of performance for this requirement is 12 months from the date of award, plus four (4) option years.

Description
The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Surveillance Research Program (CSRP) plans to procure services in supporting the Northwest Tribal Registry Project with Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB), 527 SW Hall, Suite 300 Portland, OR 97201
This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $7.0M.

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.

Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award.

The Northwest Tribal Registry (NTR) Project was developed in January 1999 by the tribally operated epidemiology program located at the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB) in Portland, Oregon.  The Tribal Registry uses state-of-the-art record linkage studies to increase the quality of health status surveillance data, especially for chronic diseases such as cancer, among AI/AN in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.

The purpose of this acquisition is to enable the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board to continue its activities within the Northwest Tribal Registry Project (NTR) to ascertain more accurate estimates of the occurrence of cancer among Northwest American Indians and Alaskan Natives and to expand and enhance the composition of the Registry (e.g., inclusion of patient rosters from the Seattle IHB and urban health clinics) to improve its completeness and representativeness.  The NTR shall continue to inform the state registries with which it links of racial misclassification, and incorporate the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program of Seattle, WA, in the linkage process directly.


The Northwest Tribal Registry collected complete data from 1996-2006 for Idaho, Oregon and Washington. By virtue of the linkages with the Tribal Registry, the registry identified over 3,000 incident AI/AN cancer cases for analysis during the nine-year period. The Registry Project has analyzed these linkages, including residual cases (i.e., those cases for which an individual is classified as AI/AN in the state cancer registry, but for which there is no record in the Tribal Registry), and using U.S. Census estimates (specifically the National Center for Health Statistics bridged-race estimates) as denominators, thus allowing for an even more comprehensive description of cancer burden among Northwest AI/AN.  These data have been analyzed in preparation for development of publications to be submitted to peer-reviewed journals.  No entity other than the NPAIHB Registry has access to these data or the analyses.

The Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB) is uniquely qualified to perform the required activities. The ability to provide more complete and accurate cancer data for Northwest AI/AN is dependent upon the successful and mutually beneficial relationships that have developed between this organization, its tribal members, and the Idaho, Oregon, and Washington State Cancer Registries.  The NPAIHB conducted repeat data linkages with all three state registries to obtain complete data through 2005.  No other entity has such a relationship with the three state cancer registries and the Native American tribal governments in the Northwest Portland Area.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research, Genetics Branch plans to procure on a sole source basis, a maintenance contract for two government-owned Affymetrix GeneChip Systems (s/n74900223; s/n 74900748) which include Fluidic Station Models (FS450U; s/n FS1214 &amp; FS450U; s/n FS1219, respectively) with Affymetrix Inc., 3380 Central Expressway; Santa Clara, CA 95051.
<p>The services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 811219 the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this procurement shall be for twelve months from date of award.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), is engaged in the study cancer genetics and the Gene Chip Instruments are an integral technique to the function of The Genetics Branch. By using SNP genotyping microarrays to analyze copy number alteration and loss of heterozygosity, and RNA expression chips to analyze gene expression alterations, the lab is able to investigate the role that specific genes or groups of genes play to influence carcinogenesis and cancer progression in tumor and cancer cell line samples.</p>
<p>The Gene Chip instruments listed above are a programmatic resource for the CCR and currently both need maintenance performed. In order to assure that these instruments are available and in good working conditions at all times for research staff, a service protection plan is needed. This plan must include a full year of service as well as unlimited support when needed during that period to include: replacement parts (new), repair services on-site as well as access to technicians 24 hours a day with a reasonable response time (no greater than 72 hours). Since Affymetrix is the manufacturer of the instrument, the maintenance is necessary from the same vendor to ensure optimal use and guarantee that efficiently trained technicians perform any service that may be needed. Any outside service provided on the proprietary instrumentation will not be covered or repaired by the manufacturer since it will be incorrect to the instruments specific functions.</p>
<p>It is critical to the research community currently using the instruments that all service be performed by the same vendor that manufactured and implemented the equipment in the lab. There is a high level of complexity regarding the Gene Chip Instrument Systems and Affymetrix only permits qualified Gene Chip service engineers who are employees of the company and are trained in all aspects of Gene Chips to perform preventative and service maintenance. It is imperative that the system is calibrated accurately and maintained according to the manufacturer's specifications. Any deviation from the specifications could run distort information or disrupt studies currently in process on the instrument. In addition, proprietary software and replacement parts are available only through Affymetrix to supply and service their instruments. Warranty on the cameras and all parts are only guaranteed if the instruments are serviced by the manufacturer. Specifically, the systems are equipped with specialized parts and software which must be aligned, calibrated and replaced properly to ensure the results are accurate for the studies being performed on the equipment. Finally, Affymetrix holds multiple patents on this instrument and is the sole source for all replacement parts and service. For these reasons, no other vendor is known to the NCI capable of providing maintenance on the Affymetrix Gene Chip Instruments.</p>

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) plan to procure on a sole source basis with Genus Biosystems; 1808 Janke Drive; Unit M; Northbrook, Illinois 60062 for gene expression analysis services using Agilent whole genome arrays.
<p>The supplies are herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106- 1(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $12 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for twelve months from date of award.</p>
<p>The laboratory program in the ROB has a long-standing interest in radiation modifiers, particularly on aspects of the stress response. Over the last 4 years, the ROB has developed two themes that are now the focus of the program. This includes the concept of "fingerprinting" drugs using drug concentrations seen in the clinic and have demonstrated for COX-inhibitors (non-specific NSIADS, COX-2 specific and RNAi). There are substantial differences in gene expression among the high concentrations often used for mechanistic studies in the laboratory, the clinically achievable concentrations and RNA interference. Such discordance may account for the lack of translation of results from the lab to the clinic. The major emphasis builds on the concept of radiation as "focused biology" such that a radiation dose and schedule can be selected to induce a phenotypic change in the cancer cell, such that the cancer is now susceptible to molecular targeted therapy. Initial work was already completed in PC3 and DU145 cells using mRNA microarray analysis. The current objective is to find the inflection points of those differentially expressed genes using PC3 and DU 145 cell lines after the radiation. In order to be able to expand and complete the ongoing research, the micro-array analysis must be completed with previous experiments and analysis in order to ensure compatibility with previous results.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide full service gene expression analysis using the Agilent Bioarray technology to provide amplification of the RNA, probe synthesis, hybridization to Agilent microarrays, scanning of the microarrays, and data analysis. The proposed Contractor offers several distinct advantages over other available services including high performance microarray metrics for sensitivity (&lt; 1 copy cell, 95% within 1.5 fold), linear dynamic range (3.5 logs), reproducibility of 7-12% with extremely small amounts of data (50 picograms RNA) and comprehensive data analysis. The proposed analysis shall be conducted using GeneSpring software, which is one of the leading microarray data analysis packages available today. The software will provide unlimited data consulting time for the data analysis, in whichever combination is requested by the NCI. The analysis shall also include customized analysis and explanation of genomic data, data mining, integrated analysis of sequence and expression data, and cross-reference of public genomic databases.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging (NIA)/NIH intends to negotiate, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, on a non-competitive, sole source basis, with Wake Forest University, Sticht Center on Aging - Center for Diabetes Research, hereinafter referred to as the Coordinating Center, for the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) - Memory in Diabetes (MIND) Study for the MIND-FUP Study.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, responsible sources may express their interest by submitting a capability statement or proposal. All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>ACCORD-MIND included a sub-set of ACCORD trial patients who participated in cognitive testing (n=2977) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain (n=620). This effort will be a two-year follow-up of the ACCORD-MIND MRI component of the clinical trial, which is in accordance with the authority 41 U.S.C. 252(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. The contractor has been involved in the recruitment, treatment strategies and clinical visits, follow-up of the participants, and collection of data on the ACCORD-MIND MRI participants from four communities across the United States. The incumbent contractor has the unique capability to provide these required services to NIA for the study follow-up. Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this study. The objectives of the study are detailed below.</p>
<p>Background and Purpose of the ACCORD-MIND Trial: <br />About 24 million people (almost 8% of the U.S. population) have diabetes. Older persons with diabetes have an increased risk for cognitive impairment and two times higher risk for dementia compared to older persons with no diabetes. Diabetes is also frequently co-morbid with other cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, which are factors also known to increase the risk for cognitive impairment and dementia. Underlying this functional impairment are pathologic structural changes in the brain that can be imaged with Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) technology.</p>
<p>ACCORD-MIND MRI is a sub-study in ACCORD, which is a randomized, multicenter, factorial designed clinical trial in 10,251 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. MIND MRI included 620 of these participants, and was conducted at four sites, and managed through a central coordinating office and four clinical networks. The coordinating center includes a central MRI quality control and reading center.</p>
<p>The goal of the ACCORD-MIND trial was to address the question as to whether three complimentary treatment strategies could reduce the risk for cognitive decline or adverse changes in brain structure. The treatment strategies were designed to control glycemia to near-normal levels (target HbA1c &lt; 6%) of fibrates, to increase HDL-cholesterol and lower triglycerides in the context of good LDL-C control by statins, and of intensive BP control targeting the normal range (SBP&lt; 120 mmHg). Specifically, ACCORD-MIND evaluates intensive glucose, blood pressure and lipid management as means to reduce detrimental changes in the brain structure and function.</p>
<p>ACCORD MIND MRI Follow-Up Study Objectives: The two-year observational MIND-MRI-FUP Study is anticipated to begin September 2010 and continue to September 2012. This document describes a follow-up to the MIND-MRI sub-study participants, implemented in the context of the overall main ACCORD Follow-up Study through NHLBI. During the follow-up study, all ACCORD-MIND MRI participants would be invited to provide informed consent for another MRI and to have the scan performed. Based upon data collected at the 40-month MIND MRI exam, an estimated 85% of the original 620 participants is anticipated to be available for this additional MRI.</p>
<p>The goals of follow-up data collection are to obtain key imaging data, to estimate trajectories of structural brain change, and to identify factors that reduce or increase the risk for brain structure damage. Therefore, the follow-up data must be comparable to those obtained during the previous ACCORD-MIND MRI sub-study.</p>
<p>Additionally, the follow-up of the MIND participants can provide unique data to develop guidelines for clinical management of older persons with diabetes and to give insight into the pathophysiology of diabetes in the brain.<br />The follow-up phase would consist of one MRI visit. Recruitment for the MRI will be done simultaneously with the follow-up clinic visits proposed for the main trial follow-up study. Clinic sites would use streamlined approaches from the current methods to obtain consent and to schedule the patient for an MRI. The MRI acquisition protocol, alert system, transmission to the QC center, quality checks and evaluation will follow the same protocol as was used in ACCORD-MIND.</p>
<p>The Coordinating Center's responsibilities include but are not limited to: continue all data collection and analysis including the documentation and maintenance of appropriate confidentiality and security of these files for the sub-study; assist in the implementation of the protocol and manuals of procedures; monitor the regulatory aspects of the study; establish standardized quality of data gathering; maintain quality control and monitoring of the performance status of the MRI sites; and provide any information necessary for regular Steering Committee, Observations Study Monitoring Board, training and other necessary study meetings; and provide technical reports as required by the Government (four quarterly reports and a final report).</p>
<p>The contract will require an extensive comparison of the MIND-FUP Study data to previously collected MIND data.</p>
<p>This proposed acquisition was previously advertised under sources sought announcements HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-SBSS-10-124 and HHS-NIH-NIDA(AG)-RDSS-10-124.</p>
<p>This notice of intent will be issued on or about April 2, 2010, and will close on or about April 19, 2010. The estimated award date will be September 2010.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>General Services Administration seeks to lease office and related space consisting of 15,002 ANSI/BOMA office square feet (ABOSF) of contiguous space in Beckley, WV. GSA is interested in considering alternative space if relocation is economically advantageous to the Government. In making such a determination, GSA will consider cost factors including, but not limited to, the total cost of the physical move (including telecommunications and computer cabling costs); tenant improvement costs (whether included in the rent or compensated separately from the rent); and anticipated rent for the space. Other factors impacting the Government's rights under a prospective lease, such as, the length of any firm term that may be required at an alternative location, length of time necessary to deliver occupancy-ready space, and the right to terminate any space vacated during the term, will also bear. The offered space must meet Government requirements for Fire Safety, ABAAS, and ISC Requirements. Property located within a base floodplain (100 year floodplain) or wetland will not be considered. Space must be situated in within the Central Business Area of Beckley, WV.
<p>Parking ratio should at least meet 4:1,000 SF to accommodate employees and visitors. A lease term of 10 years with a firm term of 5 years is sought.</p>
<p>Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposal submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building's ownership. If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:00 PM EDT, Friday, April 16, 2010. Expressions of interest should include building name and address, location of space in the building, rentable square feet offered and rentable rate per square foot (specifying services and utilities included), ANSI/BOMA defined usable square feet, and contact information for owner or authorized agent. AutoCAD (DWG file) of floor plate, if available, to demonstrate space efficiency would be appreciated.</p>

Responses to the CD2F1 strain of mice, from Harlan Laboratory, have already been established. Continued research with the CD2F1 mice will allow a strict biological and statistical comparison between the data collected with the use of these requested animals to that from previous research with CD2F1 mice from Harlan.<br /><br />This is not a request for quotes and a solicitation package will not be issued. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<SUBJECT>Study to Evaluate the Feasibility of Using Reading Achievement Levels Developed in 1992 for Reporting Results of the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress in Reading for Grades 4, 8 and 12 and to Draft Descriptions for Reporting 2009 Results

<CONTACT>Munira Mwalimu, Contracting Officer, Phone 2023576906, Email Munira.Mwalimu@ed.gov - Stephen E. Swearingen, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-357-0392, Fax 202-357-6945, Email stephen.swearingen@ed.gov
<DESC><p>The National Assessment Governing Board is preparing to design and implement a study to evaluate the feasibility of using reading achievement levels developed in 1992 for reporting results of the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in reading for grades 4, 8, and 12.
<p>The Governing Board intends to award a sole source contract to the Educational Testing Service (ETS) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions. This solicitation will be awarded in accordance with the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2) as only one responsible source can provide the required services.</p>
<p>The data to be used for this study are secure and not available to the public. As the incumbent contractor with the National Center for Education Statistics, ETS is authorized to conduct data analysis for the secure data collected for the reading assessment. The analyses required to compute the scaled data and to compute and locate the cut scores on the score scale are complex. The 2009 data collection design for reading at each grade includes an unusual data collection design called a braided design, which was designed and implemented by ETS to link score scales and maintain trend. ETS developed the methodology for scaling the data, and is therefore uniquely well-qualified and equipped to perform these analyses for the Governing Board study.</p>
<p>The procedure of item anchoring and developing anchor descriptions was developed by ETS, and ETS has experience in implementing these studies. A high level of experience and expertise are needed for this work. Many of the tools and procedures to be used in this work were developed by ETS who has extensive experience in their application. No other company is known to have as much experience with this type of work, and in particular with NAEP. A small-scale preliminary study was conducted in April 2009 to evaluate the feasibility for grades 4 and 8, based on results of the 2008 field trial in reading. The data to be used in this study are for the 2009 operational NAEP at all three grades and will use a different criterion for anchoring items.</p>
</p>
<p>Achievement levels are to be the primary method of reporting NAEP results, and reading NAEP results are to be reported within a year when a new framework has been implemented. Thus, there is an urgent need to implement this study quickly in order to avoid non-compliance with legislative requirements&nbsp;and Board policies&nbsp;governing NAEP reporting. Further, ETS regularly works with the committee of content experts for the reading NAEP who develop and review items, as well as provide additional advice on the reading assessment. The expert opinions of these groups are required for the anchoring study to be conducted for the Governing Board.</p>
<p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Subpart 6.3-Other Than Full and Open Competition, and under the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source -- Educational Testing Service&nbsp;can provide the required&nbsp;services and within the timelines required for reporting the 2009 NAEP reading results.</p>
<p>Organizations and persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Governing Board.</p>
<p>The period of performance is from the date of contract award, anticipated to be approximately September 21 through August 31, 2010.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is seeking a qualified source in anticipation of a future requirement. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security invites all interested parties to submit a written response to this Request for Information (RFI).
<p>1.0 PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security has a potential requirement to obtain contract services for training support focused on cybersecurity in relation to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Embedded Devices. The requirement is for the support of an existing training program. Courses are designed to help the control systems community, consisting of asset owners and operators, engineers, security personnel and others concerned with protecting Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources (CIKR), with understanding the fundamental concepts of cybersecurity risks associated with ICS and to provide awareness for cybersecurity.</p>
<p>2.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Prospective firms must have the capabilities to provide training program support. DHS will be the lead for this project and will provide approval for overall management decisions for the project with the contractor utilizing its' expertise for developing and delivering training to accomplish the tasks outlined in a SOW. In planning and executing each task the contractor shall support DHS's requirements associated with metrics and measures to gauge the success and impacts of the task. Prospective firms must have the capabilities to provide training support in the form of classroom delivery, online web based delivery and various transportable mediums such as Compact Discs (CDs) or Digital Video Discs (DVDs). Classroom delivery will require training to be executed in dynamic and changing offsite locations and environments such as national lab facilities, conferences, industry associated events, contractor facilities and end user's facilities, where travel will be required. Training courses will consist of varying degrees of technical content requiring the contract trainers to pose various corresponding degrees of technical understanding and expertise, depending on the course level. The contractor will be required to continue updating, enhancing and developing current and future courses at the DHS's direction.</p>
<p>Examples of courses to be supported:</p>
<p>2.1 Web Based Format<br />Cyber Security for Control Systems Engineers &amp; Operators <br />This course is a web-based training package consisting of five lessons covering threats, risks, cyber attacks, risk assessments and mitigations for control systems. It can be completed in less than an hour. This course has been approved for North American Electric Reliabilty Corporation (NERC) continuing education credits. <br />Operations Security (OPSEC) for Control Systems is a web-based training package consisting of seven lessons covering the definition of OPSEC, the five-step OPSEC process, common information-collection techniques, information protection, physical protection, appropriate and inappropriate use in the control system environment, and a summary. It can be completed in less than an hour. This course has been approved for North American Electric Reliabilty Corporation (NERC) continuing education credits. <br />This training was developed through the Control Systems Security Program, established by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security National Cyber Security Division.<br /><br />2.2 Instructor Led format - Introductory Level<br />Control Systems Cyber Security Who Needs It? (1 hour) <br />This course turns on the proverbial light bulb for many people as they realize that cyber security is as important as physical security. Some say that seeing is believing, so this course goes through a cyber attack, step by step, that takes control of a process control system. A short video shows the process an attacker could take to compromise the control of a manufacturing process (without the operator knowing about it). The course focuses on solutions aimed at mitigating this type of attack while providing a general overview of the control systems environment. Common vulnerabilities that have been found in virtually every system that the Control Systems Security Program has assessed are discussed and solutions for preventing exploits and detecting intrusions are presented. This training is made available to be supported at industry member events or venues upon request.<br /><br />2.3 Instructor Led format - Introductory Level<br />Control Systems Security for Managers (1 hour)<br />This course combines technical information with a discussion of the business case. The instructor first discusses the threat to process control and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, then, through a demonstration video, shows that it is possible for a cyber attack to cause physical problems. The class then moves on to identify mitigations to common vulnerabilities and ways to prevent and detect intrusions to process control and SCADA systems. This course concludes with a discussion about the business case and how cyber security affects the bottom line. This training is made available to be supported at industry member events or venues upon request.</p>
<p>2.4 Instructor Led format - Intermediate Level<br />Solutions for Process Control Security (4 hours)<br />The Solutions for Process Control Security training is a fast-paced course covering general control systems cyber security challenges. The training objectives include helping participants understand how attacks against control systems can be launched, identifying targets of opportunity, and providing mitigation strategies. Participants will gain an understanding on how to increase the cyber security posture of their control systems networks. This training is made available to be supported at industry member events or venues upon request.<br /><br />2.5 Introduction to Control Systems Security for the IT Professional (8 hours)<br />This course is directed to those with IT Security responsibilities or background but have no previous experience in critical infrastructure control systems and their relationship to modern IT networks. <br />Four training sessions will guide attendees from basic definitions, components, and protocols to the major applications and architectures within critical infrastructure (CI) and key resources (KR). Control system network architectures, cyber threats and vulnerabilities, and mitigations will be presented. Current and emerging government and industry activities that are addressing the issue of risk reduction will be discussed. This training is made available to be supported at industry member events or venues upon request.<br /><br />2.6 Hands-on format - Intermediate Technical Level<br />Intermediate Control Systems Security (8 hours)<br />This hands-on course is structured to help students understand exactly how attacks against process control systems could be launched and why they work and to provide mitigation strategies to increase the cyber security posture of their control systems networks. <br />Because this course is hands-on, students will get a deeper understanding of how the various tools work. Accompanying this course is a sample process control network that demonstrates exploits used for unauthorized control of the equipment and mitigation solutions. This network is also used during the course for the many hands-on exercises that will help the students develop control systems cyber-security skills they can apply when they return to their jobs. <br /><br />Every student attending this course must have a laptop computer that they can configure and bring to the class. All students in the class should have basic coding skills and a fairly deep understanding of network details, from User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), from Media Access Control (MAC) to Internet Protocol (IP). This training is made available to be supported at industry member events or venues upon request.</p>
<p>2.7 Hands-on format - Advanced Technical Level<br />Control Systems Cyber Security Advanced Training and Workshop (1 week) <br />This event will provide intensive hands-on training on protecting and securing control systems from cyber attacks, including a very realistic Red Team / Blue Team exercise that will be conducted within an actual control systems environment. It will also provide an opportunity to network and collaborate with other colleagues involved in operating and protecting control systems networks. A sample process control network will be used to demonstrate exploits and to give the student actual hands-on experience. The red team / blue team exercise will provide friendly competition as the red team tries to attack the control system and the blue team works to defend against the cyber attacks. A debriefing will highlight lessons learned from the red team, the blue team, and an overall perspective will be provided by cyber security experts who monitored and scored the activities of the red and blue teams. <br /><br />3.0 RFI RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONS</p>

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Program Manager for Training Systems intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302 and 603-1 a)(2)(ii) to Saab Training USA, 12633 Challenger Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 to acquire technical support and expertise for Verification And Validation (V&V) along with upgrade planning, development, management, and use of Force-on-Force (FOF) Instrumented Tactical Engagement Simulation Systems (I-TESS) instrumentation and software for the Precision Gunnery System (PGS) and Tank Weapons Gunnery Simulation System (TWGSS). The contract will be firm fixed priced and is estimated at $5 M.
The procurement includes COTS upgrades/enhancements to the current TWGSS and PGS systems that are resident at the Marine Corps Operational Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA). The goal of these upgrades/ enhancements is to assist MCOTEA in conducting a Force-on-Force (FoF) Phase for the Operational Assessment and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) of the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV), Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV), Light Armored Vehicle (LAV), and M1A1 Tank. Through this initiative the Marine Corps wants to verify and validate functionality of previously acquired instrumentation hardware and software, and ensure interoperability with the newly acquired USMC I-TESS family of instrumentation.PM TRASYS requires that the PGS and TWGSS hardware and software packages be upgraded and integrated with Saab Training USA's I-TESS system.  As the creator of the PGS, TWGSS, and I-TESS systems, Saab Training USA is uniquely qualified to perform these tasks as they are the only source familiar with the hardware and software of all three systems. Additionally, Saab Training USA, being the maintainers of TWGSS and PGS, can provide PM TRASYS with the expertise that will ensure the changes are compatible and complete.  It is the Government's belief that only one source is capable of meeting the requirements, and no other supplies or services will satisfy the requirement.All responses must be written and sent via electronic mail to sandi.brubaker@usmc.mil. Government will not accept telephone inquiries or responses. The point of the contact for this announcement is Sandi Brubaker, Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies approximately 7300 contiguous net usable square feet (8030 rentable square feet) of office and related space in a building under lease at 4775 Technology Circle, Grand Forks, North Dakota, 58203.  The Government intends on exercising a (5) year renewal option at this location.  The space must be available for occupancy on or before January 1, 2010.  The delineated area is bounded as follows:  
North- Gateway Drive
East- Washington Street 
South- County Rd 6
West- Starting at the intersection of County Rd 6 and Burlington Northern Rail Road head North on Burlington Northern Rail Road to Co Road 4 proceed west on County Road 4 to N 55th St proceed North on N 55th St to Gateway Dr

Other applicable requirements include:	
-Full-service lease (all utility, services, maintenance costs included in rent)
-Parking  61 adequate, on-site paved parking spaces in a lot under Lessors control

The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous.  The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement and market survey as basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to exercise its renewal option to remain at its current location.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST SHOULD INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:

1. Building Name and Address, and location of space in the building.
2. Rentable Square feet offered and rate per rentable square foot (specifying services and utilities included)
3. ANSI/BOMA Usable Square Feet and the Common Area Factor.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this Modification 56 is to obligate an additional $25,494 in funding in support of Work Assignment 3-103 which has been previously issued. The period of performance for this work assignment will be from April 13, 2009 though March 31, 2010. WA 3-103 is now funded up to $335,710. Additionally, funding is reduced for WA 3-100 by $4,065 which was previously issued. The period of performance for WA 3-100 is from April 8, 2009 through March 31, 2010. A total of $955,395 in funding is available for Work assignment 3-100. This modification also provides initial funding in the amount of $4,065 for Work Assignment 4-100. The period of performance of WA 4-100 will be from April 1, 2010 through March 31, 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WA 3-103 is to support the development of tools and training aligned with the unique aspects of the ARRA for Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) State programs and the borrower community of the DWSRF. This support will include: (a) participating in and providing support to a full day working session with the DWSRF program to support the development of a program oversight strategy for the unique needs of the ARRA funds. The contractor shall provide its expertise in program management, financial management, auditing and risks, and data management; (b) developing a means to transfer data from the DWSRF's Project Management System to the Office of Management &amp; Budget's (OMB) Recovery.gov website; and (c) supporting two (2) web seminars on the DWSRF and ARRA. This support for the webinars shall consist of getting a web seminar service, managing registration, and recording questions and answers during the web seminars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WA 4-100 is a continuation of the efforts performed under WA 3-100. The objective of this work assignment is to provide support to EPA's Office of Wastewater Management's State Revolving Fund Branch in implementing and properly managing funds provide to the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) under the ARRA. Management of the CWSRF ARRA funds would include training on ARRA requirements and State oversight, development of brochures/reports on the use of ARRA funds, assisting EPA Headquarters and Regions with programmatic and financial reviews of State programs and support recipients/borrowers compliance with ARRA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>Under the Authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1, the VISN 19 Rocky Mountain Consolidated Contracting Center, Denver, CO, proposes to enter into a non-competitive commercial items contract with Sheridan Memorial Hospital & Nursing Home, 440 W Laurel Ave., Plentywood, MT 59254, for a Primary Care location and support staff for VA providers to provide primary care over tele-health conferencing systems. The Video Health conferencing equipment and circuitry will be provided by VA Montana HCS. VA patients will be determined and referred to Sheridan Memorial facilities site by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA intends to provide VA Physician coverage for primary care services over a Tele-Health VA network to an access point at Sheridan Memorial Hospital. Contractor's unique characteristics include an extensive history of already established tele-health services located in their facility. They are trained and understand the use, logistics and special requirements of providing health care over Tele-Health equipment. Sheridan Memorial Hospital is the only facility within a 100+ mile radius that can provide the appropriate facility and professional clinical staff required. The agreement with Sheridan Memorial Hospital for this contract will allow Veterans easy access to primary care without the need to travel significant distances to the nearest fully staffed VA CBOC site. The geographic area contains many elderly veterans whose mobility to travel between sites for specific care is limited, in addition to hazardous driving conditions during winter months. Locating the Tele-Health primary care services in the community will provide veterans with the minimal amount of travel required to receive VA services. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within the due date for receipt of proposals will be considered by the Government.  A Determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. *****

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commerical items prepared in accordance with the format found in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.
The solicitation number for this request is 70181AQ055 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quote (RFQ).  The soliciation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Ferderal Acquisition Circular (FAC 05-40) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). 
This is not a small business set-aside procurement NACIS classification code: 541990 and PSC: 5895.  
STATEMENT OF WORK:Background - Geolocators will be placed on shorebirds on refuges and other public lands located in western and northern Alaska.  Data processing will be done in the Anchorage Regional Office.  The goal is to determine migration stopover and wintering sites for migratory shorebirds that breed in Alaska so as to understand where these birds spend their time outside of Alaska, using state-of-the-art light-level geolocator technology to gain this information.  Knowing migratory routes and wintering grounds, and hence habitat requirements, will allow us to assess potential threats faced by birds away from Alaska - where birds live for most of the year and where most problems are likely to occur.
Because the animal must carry the geolocator during its annual migration, it is essential that it is not too heavy.  Experts recommend that the geolocator and attachment to body weight ratio for leg mounting be kept under 2%, and preferably only 1% or less, while the maximum ratio for back mounting is considered to be 3-5%, depending on species.  The species of study and number of geolocators to purchase will vary with my ability to acquire funds.  We plan to purchase geolocators for Dunlin, Lesser Yellowlegs and Red Knot's.  Due to the size of Dunlin and Lesser Yellowlegs, we need a geolocator which weighs (with attachment materials) less than 1.2 grams (~2% of body weight).  Given the weight of the plastic band, glue and attachment thread, we anticipate needing a geolocator that weighs less than 0.9 grams.  For the Red Knot, the geolocator itself must weigh less than 1.3 grams.
SPECIFICATIONS OR EQUAL:Dimensions: no larger than 22x8x7mm	Weight: 0.8 gram model or 1.2 gram modelPower source: internal battery will last 2yrs (projected life) from time of manufacture under normal useLogging interval: Light should be sampled at least once every five minutes and the device should record the maximum light length detected during a 30 minute interval.  Shorter intervals for sampling light is okay too. Logging duration: continuous from start until memory full.Download time per year logged: approx 20-30 mins.Data retention: 2years (possible data extraction by manufacturer after battery has died).Clock drift: no more than 1min/month. With start time, drift can be corrected in post processing.Interface: mechanism for interfacing between geolocator and computer, including hardware and software. Software: software to convert sunrise and sunset into location, and to find altitude angle of the sun given location and time.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Programs for Certain Commercial Items (10 U.S.C. 2304(g) and 2305 and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) and 253a and 253b), FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items (Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-355)), and FAR Subpart 37.4, Nonpersonal Health Care Services (10 U.S.C. 2304 and 41 U.S.C. 253). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; therefore, a written solicitation will not be issued. The Billings Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a fixed-price commercial item contract in response to Request for Quotation (RFQ)-10-10-026-REL. This solicitation is restricted to 100% Small Business concerns. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-39. The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 621111 and the small business size standard is $10.0 million. PRICE SCHEDULE - OBSTETRICAL SERVICES: BASE YEAR: 104 Clinics @ $____________________ per Clinic = $_________________________; OPTION YEAR ONE: 104 Clinics @ $____________________ per Clinic = $_________________________; OPTION YEAR TWO: 104 Clinics @ $____________________ per Clinic = $_________________________; OPTION YEAR THREE: 104 Clinics @ $____________________ per Clinic = $_________________________; OPTION YEAR FOUR: 104 Clinics @ $____________________ per Clinic = $_________________________; GRAND TOTAL: $_________________________. STATEMENT OF WORK: The purpose of this acquisition is to acquire Obstetrical Services at the Wind River Service Unit, PHS Indian Health Centers, Arapahoe and Fort Washakie, Wyoming. The Contractor shall visit the Fort Washakie Health Center, Fort Washakie, Wyoming, one day every week between the hours of 8:00 am and 12:00 pm and the Arapahoe Health Center, Arapahoe, Wyoming one day every week between the hours of 8:00 am and 12:00 pm. This procurement is a nonpersonal health care service contract, as defined in FAR 37.101, under which the Contractor is an independent contractor. The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical and professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment). The Contractor shall indemnify the Government for any liability producing acts or omissions by the Contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance. The Contractor shall maintain medical liability insurance, which is not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned. The Contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance. MAJOR DUTIES: The Contractor shall provide onsite services for an obstetrics clinic to outpatients scheduled by the Government physicians/providers at the Wind River Service Unit. The Contractor shall visit the Fort Washakie Health Center, Fort Washakie, Wyoming, one day every week between the hours of 8:00 am to 12:00 pm and the Arapahoe Health Center, Arapahoe, Wyoming one day every week between the hours of 8:00 am and 12:00pm. During each clinic the Contractor will see up to 24 patients scheduled by the staff of the Fort Washakie Health Center or Arapahoe Health Center. The Contractor shall take a history and perform an appropriate examination. The findings shall be correlated with the laboratory and x-ray findings. The Contractor shall make a verbal report to a Government physician and shall further make a written consultation on the patient's medical chart or in the Electronic Health Record. The written consultation shall include the findings, impression, and recommendations about the management. The Government will provide space, nursing assistance, laboratory services, x-ray services, and pharmacy services. No other reimbursement such as transportation, food, lodging, fringe benefit or insurance will be authorized. Any rescheduling of clinic days or times shall involve consultation with the Contractor by the Government, but shall be at the convenience of the Government. Notification of change must be given at least two (2) weeks prior to the date of change. The Contractor shall be available for consultation by telephone and shall give recommendations to the Government physicians about management of patients seen between clinics, at no charge to the Government. Physician fees for inpatients or outpatient office visits at another facility will be paid at Medicare rate or lower. The Contractor shall accept transfer for patients to his care at his private office or at a local contract hospital by formal written referral from a Government physician. In the event that an emergency admission of an eligible person occurs in a local contract hospital, and that the Contractor is responsible for the care of the patient, the preferred procedure is telephone notification and request for the authorization by an IHS physician. Such a request may be made after the admission by calling the IHS physician on call or the Chief Executive Officer. In such an emergency admission, failure to notify the Wind River Service Unit within 72 hours removes the obligation of the Indian Health Service to participate in the responsibility for payment. While the primary responsibility for notification is with the patient or the patient's family, notification by the Contractor or the hospital may often avert difficulties. Referral from one hospital to another requires the prior approval by an IHS physician. Initial oral permission is followed by written authorization by the IHS Physician. Laboratory and other diagnostic tests including x-ray examinations shall be made in one of the Indian Health Service Centers whenever possible. The Contractor will order these tests elsewhere when they are not available at the Indian Health Centers or when the patient is an inpatient at another facility under the care of the Contractor. Authorization shall be obtained from the referring IHS physician before tests are scheduled. It shall be required that the Contractor's private office and the hospital the Contractor utilizes for inpatient procedures be no farther than 60 minutes driving time from Fort Washakie, Wyoming or Arapahoe, Wyoming under normal driving conditions at posted speed limits in a private vehicle. The Contractor will be required to abide by all the rules and regulations that govern the Privacy Act, the Indian Health Service, and the Department of Health and Human Services. All new employees are required to take HIPAA training within a few days after receiving their award letter, notice-to-proceed, access and annually thereafter. All new contractors will be required to write notes, orders (lab, x-ray, and pharmacy) and CHS referrals in the Electronic Health Record. Training will be scheduled during specialty clinic hours. The primary agent/official responsible for monitoring this procurement in a project officer capacity and who will be verifying that all supplies and/or services have been received and delivered will be JoLynn Davis, R.N., D.O.N., Clinical Nursing, Wind River Service Unit. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The performance of this contract shall be from June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2011, with four 12-month options. GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY: The IHS shall provide all necessary equipment and supplies. The Wind River Service Unit will be responsible for getting the Contractor access and clearance to all computer services necessary to carry out his/her duties. COMPUTER SECURITY: Pursuant to the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), the Contractor will be required to complete a course in Computer Security Awareness Training (CSAT). This training must be completed annually by all employees including all contractors. The Contractor will be required to comply with the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, "Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors," and the associated Office of Management and Budget (OMB) implementation guidance for personal identity verification for all affected contractor and subcontractor personnel. SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS: Contractors cannot serve as expert witnesses in any suit against the Federal Government. Many of the IHS patients receiving services may only speak a native language and/or reside on a Native American Reservation; therefore, the Contractor must demonstrate sensitivity to cross-cultural and language differences. CONTRACTING OFFICER AUTHORITY: Authority to negotiate changes in the terms, conditions or amounts cited in this contract is reserved for the Contracting Officer. PROJECT OFFICER: The project officer shall be responsible for: (1) Monitoring the Contractors technical progress, including surveillance and assessment of performance and recommending technical changes; (2) Interpreting the Statement of Work; (3) Technical evaluation as required; (4) Technical inspections and acceptance; and (5) Assisting the Contractor in the resolution of technical problems encountered during performance of this contract.

Payment shall be made by the Billings Area Financial Management Branch, P.O. Box 36600, Billings, Montana 59107. PRO-CHILDREN ACT OF 1994: The Contractor certifies that it will comply with the provisions of Public Law 103-227, Pro-Children Act of 1994, which imposes restrictions on smoking where federally funded children's services are provided. CHILD CARE NATIONAL AGENCY CHECK AND INVESTIGATION (CNACI). A CNACI must be completed for all Indian Health Service (IHS) contractor personnel within the Billings Area. Public Law (P.L.) 101-630, Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act and P.L. 101-647, Crime Control Act of 1990, require the IHS to conduct a character and criminal history background investigation on all contractors performing services in IHS facilities.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

This solicitation number is NHLBI-PB-(HL)-2010-113-DDC and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38 (12/10/2009).

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to procure the following from Applied BioSystem, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, CA 94404.

Part Number, 1029417, OPT TEMPO LC MALDI  SPOTTING System; high performance LC MALDI spotting system for robust contact-free electrostatic MALDI deposition of fast chromatographic separations for peptide separation and metabolite identification.  

System will include Electrostatic spotting stage with 8-plate capacity for Opti-TOF(tm) 123x81mm (3x5) inserts for 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF9(tm), Analyzer, or with 16-plate capacity for Opti-TOF(tm) 44 mm inserts for 4700 Proteomics Analyzer or for QSTAR Elite with oMALDI(tm) source. A three-channel micro-LC pump system with gradient flow range from 100 nl/min to 3 uL/min and post-column addition of MALDI matrix solution (at up to 15 ul/min).  Operation requires connection to a source of 100 psi (6.9 bar) regulated clean, dry air or nitrogen. Autosampler with 4 microtiter/54x2mil vial / deepwell plate capacity.


The sole source determination is based on the need to purchase a system that offers software compatible with the 5800 MALDI TOF/TOF which is manufacture by Applied BioSystem. To ensure smooth operation of both essential parts of the workflow, the Government intends to upgrade the existent Applied Biosystems 4700 MALDI TOF/TOF.  The new 5800 has a number of advantages, for example the system offers ten times faster laser which enables the Government to acquired more spectra and get more peptide identifications from a single spot. Another application is iTRAQ analysis which will allow the lab to use the new 5800 as a complementary tool to the existent Orbitrap workflow. By combining the two, the lab can get a better coverage and in the case of iTRAQ, more statistical data measurements and tighter protein ratios.  The system will be used to share the workload with the existing instruments to reduce the backlog of projects, provide functional redundancy for the current instruments and increase the sensitivity and mass accuracy of the resulting data.

A market research was conducted and there were no small businesses able to provide the Applied Biosystem instrument.

The Government=s anticipated delivery date is 90 days after receipt of purchase order.

FAR Provisions apply to this acquisition are:1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items (JUN 2008) 2) As stated in FAR Clause 52.212-2 (a), The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<DESC>This is a competitive combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. DTRT57-10-R-20024 is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP). This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13.5 and FAR Part 12. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-39. The NAICS Code is 541990 and the Small Business size standard is $7.0M. The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed-Price contract. This is a Small Business Set-Aside.
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, is seeking to locate small business concerns interested in providing continuing support to further reduce incidents of driving while intoxicated (DWI) through the development and evaluation of measurement techniques for alcohol on the breath, development of performance guidelines for breath measurement devices, testing of instruments intended for police use, and technical support of demonstration and research programs.</p>
<p>Task 1-Inerlock Device Testing Program Support--The Volpe Center is supporting the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Alcohol Countermeasures Program. NHTSA's automobile ignition Interlock Device Testing Program because of its potential impact on alcohol countermeasures. The Volpe Center is testing interlock devices sent to the Volpe Center by the device manufacturers and preparing reports on all performed alcohol interlock device testing for NHTSA review.<br />The contractor will support this interlock device testing task by performing the following sub-tasks:<br />Assist with the laboratory testing of interlock devices; prepare reports on the interlock device testing; and attend interlock meetings, conferences, workshops, and events.<br />Task 2-Research Program Support--The contractor will help evaluate the international standards for breath alcohol analyzers developed by the Organization International de Metrologie Legale (OIML). The contractor will then help design and implement new Model Specifications for testing alcohol test devices. A new Model Specification will need to be written for Evidential Breath Testers to incorporate those OIML changes that NHTSA deems appropriate. The contractor will also help draft the NHTSA response to international standards for breath alcohol analyzers developed by the OIML.<br />Task 3-BASS device upgrade--The contractor will help the Alcohol Countermeasures Program provide new upgrades to the hardware and software for the Breath Alcohol Sample Simulator (BASS). The BASS is used to deliver various flow rates of saturated water/ ethanol vapor at 34&#61616;C to an evidential breath tester. The BASS is currently an electronically controlled, solenoid valve device. These solenoid valves open and close very rapidly, and this rapid movement can cause pressure variations. Since many modern breath test devices use sophisticated flow/pressure sensors, they may be confused by these pressure variations. The new BASS will be fully computerized and will use motion controllers to carefully open and close new valves.<br />Task 4-Police Breath Alcohol Test Tutorial--The contractor will assist in the update of a tutorial paper discussing the Police Breath Alcohol test for lawyers and police officers. <br />Some travel will be required. The estimated period of performance is three (3) years from award date.</p>
<p>A copy of the statement of work is attached to this synopsis/solicitation.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695. <br />Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 16 APR 2010, 10:00 a.m., EST. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the Agency. Anticipated award date is on or about 16 APR 2010.

<p><br />Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is included.</p>
<p>Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14A<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.</p>

This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates the provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27. This is a 100% small-business set-aside. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 316211 with a size standard of 1,000 EMP.
The contract resulting from this combined synopsis, solicitation, will be a firm-fixed price contract. 
DELIVERY/SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS: Prices shall be FOB destination, delivery to Mountain Warfare Training Center (MWTC) ATTN: S-3  HC 83, Box 1 BLDG 1467 Bridgeport, CA 93517-5009. Required delivery date is no later than 31 May 2010. 
PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS: Preservation and Packaging shall be best commercial practice, sufficient to protect and preserve all items supplied under this contract during shipping to destination.
EVALUATION PROCEDURES/BASIS FOR AWARD The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract using FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). Only one (1) award may be made to the responsible quoter(s) who:1) quotes the brand name items specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation, conforming to the delivery requirement and; 2) quotes the lowest evaluated price. Information submitted by the offeror must be suficient to establish that the quoter is proposing the brand name items specified above. Quoters are  required to submit quotations for all CLINs. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions with quoters. Quotations should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.
Quoters are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/ Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful and a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

(See attachment 1 - Performance Work Statement)</p>
<p>This requirement is not a Small Business Set Aside. This is a full and open competitive acquisition.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this acquisition is 611512 (Flight Training)</p>
<p>This combined synopsis/solicitation contains all incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-38, Effective 1 Feb 10.</p>
<p>The following provisions and clauses are applicable:</p>
<p>52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Offerors are required to submit their offers in four sections:</p>
<p>Section 1: Price <br />See Attachment 2 for Price/CLIN Schedule</p>
<p>Section 2: Technical Capability (not to exceed 20 pages. Page size 8.5x11, Times New Roman, 12 Font). The offeror must meet or exceed ALL technical evaluation factors to be determined technically acceptable. If the lowest priced offeror is determined to be technically acceptable, no further evaluation will be made on other offers received for this procurement. If the lowest priced offeror is not determined to be technically acceptable, the Government will evaluate the next lowest priced offeror until a technically acceptable offer is identified.</p>
<p>Technical Capability will be assessed based on the following information:</p>
<p>a. Interested Offerors shall describe in their proposal what type of manned-fixed aircraft they intend to use. (Reference: PWS paragraph 4.0)</p>
<p>b. Interested Offerors shall describe in their proposal the video system equipment performance criteria. (Reference: PWS paragraphs 4.0 and 4.1.4)</p>
<p>c. Interested Offerors shall describe in their proposal the air to ground communication capability. (Reference: PWS paragraphs 4.0 and 4.1.4)</p>
<p>d. Interested Offerors shall describe in their proposal the air to air communication capability. (Reference: PWS paragraphs 4.0 ad 4.1.4)</p>
<p>e. Interested Offerors shall describe in their proposals the cockpit to cabin interphone capability. (Reference: PWS paragraphs 4.0 and 4.1.4)</p>
<p>f. Interested offerors shall describe in their proposals the ability to conduct training within a 20 mile radius of Tinker AFB, OK. (Reference: PWS paragraphs 4.0 and 4.4)</p>
<p>g. Interested Offerors shall include in their proposals resumes that support key personnel's ability to perform ground and flight task requirements. (Reference: PWS paragraph 1.3)</p>
<p>h. Interested Offerors shall include in their proposals credentials to address the PWS's requirements of appropriate certificates and qualifications required by FAA. (Reference: PWS paragraph 1.3)</p>
<p>Section 3: Representations and Certifications per FAR 52.212-3 (This item will be considered met if current Reps and Certs are available on ORCA)</p>
<p>Section 4: Offeror shall submit up to a total of three (3) past performance contract references on contracts considered most relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform this effort. This information is required on the offeror, subcontractors, teaming partners, and/or joint venture partners proposed to perform at least 25 percent of the total effort based on the total proposed price, or those that will perform aspects of the effort the Offeror considers critical to performing the contract. References must include the company name, contract number, point of contact, valid contact address and phone number, and a brief synopsis of the contract requirement.</p>
<p>Past Performance will be used only as part of the Responsibility Determination - it is NOT an evaluation factor, and will not be taken into consideration in determining technical acceptability.</p>
<p>52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration</p>
<p>52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers--Commercial Items:</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated using two factors which are as follows and listed from most to least important: (1) Price, and (2) Technical. Award will be made on the basis of the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror. The offeror must meet or exceed ALL technical evaluation factors to be determined technically acceptable. If the lowest priced offeror is determined to be technically acceptable, no further evaluation will be made on other offers received for this procurement. If the lowest priced offeror is not determined to be technically acceptable, the Government will evaluate the next lowest priced offeror until a technically acceptable offer is identified. The Government does intend to make award without discussions but reserves the right to hold discussions if determined in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors for award of this requirement are Price and Technical Capability.</p>
<p>Price will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>Price will be evaluated for reasonableness. A combination of evaluation techniques will be accomplished IAW FAR 15.404-1(b). The Government will evaluate proposed prices to determine whether prices reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the various elements of the offeror's technical proposal. Price analysis techniques may include a comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation, comparison with other contract prices for similar services, and/or comparison of proposed prices with the independent government cost estimate. Proposals will then be ranked by total evaluated price from lowest to highest. This will include the total proposed price of the basic contract period and total price for all options. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise option(s). Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer.</p>
<p>Technical Capability will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>The offeror shall provide a technical proposal showing how they intend to address the following specific PWS requirements:<br />a. Proposed manned-fixed aircraft must as a minimum meet the requirements of PWS paragraph 4.0.</p>
<p>b. Proposed video system equipment must as a minimum meet the requirements of PWS paragraphs 4.0 and 4.1.4.</p>
<p>c. Proposed air to ground communication capability must as a minimum meet the requirements of PWS paragraphs 4.0, and 4.1.4.</p>
<p>d. Proposed air to air communication capability must as a minimum meet the requirements of PWS paragraphs 4.0 and 4.1.4.</p>
<p>e. Proposed cockpit to cabin interphone capability must as a minimum meet the requirements of PWS paragraphs 4.0 and 4.1.4.</p>
<p>f. Proposed ability to conduct training within a 20 mile radius of Tinker AFB, OK must as a minimum meet the requirements of PWS paragraphs 4.0 and 4.4.</p>
<p>g. Proposed resumes that support key personnel's qualification and ability to perform ground and flight task requirements must as a minimum meet the requirements to PWS paragraph 1.3.</p>
<p>h. Proposed credentials to address the PWS's requirements of appropriate certificates and qualifications required by FAA must as a minimum meet the requirements of PWS paragraph 1.3.</p>
<p>Technical proposals will be rated Acceptable, if they meet the government's requirements. Reasonably Susceptible of being made Acceptable, if there is doubt regarding whether an aspect of the proposal meets a specified measure of merit established in their technical approach, or Unacceptable, if it fails to meet specified measure of merit established in their technical approach. All Unacceptable proposals will be eliminated from the competitive range and will not be further evaluated.</p>
<p>Past Performance<br />Past Performance will be used only as part of the Responsibility Determination - it is NOT an evaluation factor, and will not be taken into consideration in determining technical acceptability. It is to be used after the potential winning offeror has been chosen based upon the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable criteria. As part of the Responsibility Determination, past performance will be evaluated IAW FAR 9.1. In addition to the references provided by each offeror, past performance information may be obtained through Government contractor performance record systems. <br />Additional Required Information<br />1. Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Address:</p>
<p>Address: _______________________________________________________________<br />ABA Routing: _________________________________<br />Account Number: ______________________________</p>

<p>52.212-3, All offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer. If this is not included with the offer, the offeror may be considered unresponsive. If current Reps and Certs are posted in ORCA, this requirement will be considered met.</p>

<p>1.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty one (21) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel (Falcon Jet Corporation). Each aircraft is equipped with two Parker-Hannifin ABEX hydraulic pumps; Parker-Hannifin ABEX is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The hydraulic pump is a variable speed, variable delivery, pressure compensated pump which delivers hydraulic fluid under pressure to the various aircraft hydraulic subsystems in response to subsystem demand. The pump requires an overhaul every 3,000 flight (flt) hours. The HU25 fleet is tentatively scheduled to be retired in 2014 therefore the repair demand may decrease in the option years.</p>
<p>2.0 SCOPE</p>
<p>2.1. This Statement of Objectives (SOO) establishes the minimum requirements necessary to repair and overhaul hydraulic pumps P/N 40162.</p>
<p>2.2. Hydraulic pumps shall be repaired and/or overhauled IAW the OEM, Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) 29-11-25 Revision 1 dated 15 Feb 2000 or later. Hydraulic pumps have a restoration (overhaul/high-time) interval, of 3000 flt. hrs. HU-25 hydraulic pumps are serial tracked, by Part Numbers (P/N) and Serial Numbers (S/N) under USCG ACMS. This tracking provides historical records of repairs/overhauls, item location, status, and an effective method of configuration control.</p>
<p>2.3. Repair/overhaul of the hydraulic pump, must be accomplished IAW the manufacturer's specifications. This SOO, it is not intended to be all inclusive, nor detract from the procedures outlined in the manufacturer's drawings, manuals, specifications, and service bulletins.</p>
<p>2.4. The contractor must have access to, or ability to obtain, current OEM Component Maintenance Manuals, Revisions, Service Bulletins, Modifications, Amendments, and drawings as the USCG does not own, nor can it provide this data.</p>
<p>2.5. The contractor must identify, list, and provide the current status of all OEM Component Maintenance Manuals revisions, Service Bulletins, Modifications, Amendments, and other specifications applicable to the repair and overhaul of Coast Guard hydraulic pump P/N 40162.</p>
<p>2.6. The contractor must be responsible for all necessary functions to perform services requested. This includes, but is not limited to, required tooling, manuals, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, documentation, preservation, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul HU-25 hydraulic pumps.</p>
<p>3.0 OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>3.1. The objectives of the USCG Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) HU-25 Division:</p>
<p>3.1.1. To obtain the services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 145 authorized repair center or equivalent to effectively test, troubleshoot, clean, repair/overhaul, and/or modify HU-25 hydraulic pumps to the most current configuration and have them returned to service for USCG operational use, in Ready For Issue (RFI) condition.</p>
<p>3.1.2. To have all HU-25 hydraulic pumps repaired/overhauled to meet OEM's specifications IAW the OEM's Component Maintenance Manuals, Service Bulletins, Modifications, Amendments, and Specifications.</p>
<p>3.1.3. To track and document all work performed on HU-25 hydraulic pumps undergoing repair/overhaul as required under USCG ACMS. This is accomplished via a Component Repair Record (CRR) which is used by the USCG to update the Significant Component History Reports (SCHR) and to maintain the integrity of OEM restoration intervals and life cycle limits as applicable to the HU-25 hydraulic pump assemblies.</p>
<p>3.1.4. To obtain and observe at least two levels of repair/overhaul services for HU25 hydraulic pumps. The USCG anticipates at least two levels of service and contractors may propose additional levels, as such for separate incorporation of service bulletins, completion of modifications, the breakout of major components, etc. At a minimum, these two levels of service, "Repair," and "Overhaul," must be addressed :</p>
<p>3.1.4.1. "Repair" - "Return to Service" which is considered inspect, repair, and test as necessary. This work consists of inspection and analysis usually of specific defective conditions, repair of the conditions, replacement of defective parts only as necessary, and testing to meet the OEM's functional return to service requirements. A repair does not zero the "Time Since Overhaul" (TSO), component time continues for repaired items.</p>
<p>3.1.4.2. "Overhaul" - "High Time," having reached one of the OEM restoration intervals 3000 hrs., any life cycle limits, or having some other general condition (out-of-limit/out-of-tolerance) such as excessive wear, tear, damage, or corrosion, as deemed to require an overhaul level of service. An "Overhaul" is considered over and above the "Repair" scope; it includes the complete teardown, inspection, rework, assembly, and testing of components, to OEM original or rebuild specifications. An overhaul includes as required, the incorporation of applicable, service bulletins, modifications, configuration changes, and the replacement parts as necessary to satisfy OEM restoration interval and life cycle limited requirements. An overhaul zeroes the TSO and effectively restarts restoration intervals and OEM component life cycle limits as applicable.</p>
<p>3.1.5. Replace parts as follows:</p>
<p>3.1.5.1. Component parts found to be in serviceable condition IAW OEM specifications and functional testing shall be reused.</p>
<p>3.1.5.2. Missing parts, defective parts, high time, life, or cycle limited parts which cannot otherwise be repaired IAW OEM specifications, shall be scrapped and replaced with new OEM parts or other USCG serviceable parts, repaired IAW OEM specifications.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM<br />FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (48 CFR CHAPTER 1)<br />FAR 52.212-1 Instructions To Offerors Commercial Items (Jun 2008) <br />SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 19.702(a)(1), the offeror shall submit a subcontracting plan along with any proposal which exceeds $500,000 and which has subcontracting possibilities. <br />If the proposal exceed $500,000 and the offeror believes there are no subcontracting possibilities, the offeror should include with the proposal a letter so stating, along with supporting rationale. The plan shall comply with the requirements of FAR clause 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan. In accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause, upon acceptance by the Contracting Officer, the plan will be incorporated into the resultant contract. NOTE: SUBCONTRACTING PLANS ARE NOT REQUIRED FROM A SMALL BUSINESS OR FOREIGN FIRMS.<br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items (Jan 1999) Award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance. The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose quote is identified as offering the best value solution.</p>
<p>o Factor 1 -Technical/Management Solution/Approach<br />o Factor 2 - Performance Measures and Metrics<br />o Factor 3 - Past Performance<br />o Factor 4 - Cost/Price<br />Factors 1, 2 and 3 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 4. While the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/Price factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor. Cost/Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical, past performance and performance factors approach equality.</p>
<p>DETAILED FACTORS</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Management/Solution/Approach<br />The technical/management solution/approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Offeror's solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of Hydraulic Pumps (repair). The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the offeror has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused. Evidence of the quality of the technical management/solution/approach includes:<br />(a) A comprehensive performance work statement and contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.<br />(b) A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.<br />(c) A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes. The management approach needs to provide:</p>
<p>&#61607; Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing large enterprise-wide managed services under performance based arrangements.</p>
<p>&#61607; Clear lines of communication between the Contractor's team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.</p>
<p>&#61607; Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.</p>
<p>(d) The Offeror's validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance, e.g., ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications.<br />Factor 2: Performance Measures and Metrics<br />The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:<br />(a) Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives,</p>
<p>(b) Identify the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness,</p>
<p>(c) Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Past Performance<br />The past performance evaluation will examine how the Offeror's past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction. The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the proposal.<br />The past performance evaluation will also examine the Offeror's actual performance on repair/overhaul of similar or like items. This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.<br />Factor 4: Cost/Price<br />Each Offeror's cost/price quote will be evaluated based on the following:<br />(a) Evaluation or proposed price/cost. Offeror's quote shall include a firm-fixed-price for each of the one-year ordering periods contained in the 3-year base &amp; the 2-year option.</p>
<p>(b) Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.</p>
<p>(c) Realism: A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the Contractor's proposed cost/price proposal.</p>
<p>The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractor's technical proposal.<br />52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (AUG 2009) <br />An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>&nbsp;<br />COMDTINST 4200.14 Notice for Filing Agency Protests</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.</p>
<p>If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<DESC>Note: This is the same effort referenced on FedBizOpps # FA8622-09-D-5999-0100.
This notice is a sources sought synopsis with specific interest in small business capability. No solicitation is being issued at this time; while a formal solicitation may be issued at a later date, this notice does not commit the government to ultimately award a contract. The work is for Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This notice is prepared in accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). This synopsis is published with the intent of determining whether sufficient interest exists to solicit the requirement as a small business set aside under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712, "Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)/Aircraft," size standard of 1,500 employees. 
The Aeronautical Systems Center, Air Force Material Command, intends to award one or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity A&AS contract(s) for the work characterized in the attached draft Performance Work Statement (PWS). The contract period of performance is anticipated to be five (5) years, with no option periods, and the ceiling is anticipated to be three billion ($3,000,000,000.00) dollars. Small businesses are advised that FAR 52.219-14, "Limitations on Subcontracting," applies, wherein "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern."
Responses to this synopsis shall include the following information:
1. State your interest in performing in the capacity of the prime contractor or as a subcontractor.
2. State your company's business size and status (including but not limited to: small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business, women-owned small business, historically under-utilized business zone (HUBZone) small business) in conjunction with NAICS code 541712, size standard of 1,500 employees.
3. State your company's CAGE code as listed in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR), and a point of contact (POC) name, telephone number, and e-mail address. 
Strategy - One or more ID/IQ contracts would be awarded, comprising a consolidated scope, constituting all studies, projects, deliverables, and Professional and Management Assistance (PMA) for all labor categories contained in the attached draft PWS (the prime contractor and team on each awarded contract would be responsible for performing in all labor categories). Note that this award strategy requires prime contractors to propose on all labor categories. If interested in this award strategy, please respond as stated above and state your industry perspective as to the pros and cons of this approach. 
Do not mark your information "company proprietary" or with any other type of restriction. Any information submitted will become the property of the Government. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with this or future requests. Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as amendments to this announcement. Responses shall be made via e-mail to jonathan.taliani@wpafb.af.mil with courtesy copies to alexander.slate@wpafb.af.mil, robert.johnson4@wpafb.af.mil, and laura.bushong@wpafb.af.mil. All pertinent information will be available for viewing at FedBizOpps (FBO), http://www.fbo.gov, and The Preaward Information Exchange System (PIXS), https://pixs.wpafb.af.mil/. It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review these sites frequently for updates and amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with FAR 52.204-7, "Central Contractor Registration," lack of registration in CCR, available at https! ://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx, will make an offeror ineligible for contract award. Additionally, in accordance with FAR 52.204-8, "Annual Representations and Certifications," offerors are also reminded to register with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov. Please provide responses by 17 March 2010. Any questions shall be addressed via e-mail to jonathan.taliani@wpafb.af.mil.
Please refer to the current CAPS contract information, Attachment 3, CAPS Contract Labor Categories, 16 Oct 07, for a starting place. Assume the ability to add additional labor categories as needed.
At the present time, another industry day is anticipated once the government is prepared to give more definitive answers regarding strategy intentions. This date is to be determined and industry will be advised of updates.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The government reserves the right to hold discussions during the process of product standardization.  In addition, the government reserves the right to cancel this standardization action in its entirety if indicated.

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have, or be in the process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is June 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Mid-Atlantic Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. 

The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  When requested, vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the product and pricing request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:

1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting.  The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.  
2.	The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review.  The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  
3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. 

a.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
 (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

a.	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Vendors must provide an initial response to each Technical/Company criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of IV Administration Sets and Accessories. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  

a.	At a minimum, a complete product line includes, but is not limited to, the functional equivalent in all sizes of the products below:

Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who have met the technical/company criteria will progress to the clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples and literature concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested. 

Clinical Evaluation Process

For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1.	The drip chamber is clear and allows visualization of drops 
	a. Promotes accurate drip rate to deliver proper amount of fluid/drug prescribed
	b. Evaluator will assess by filling drip chamber and visualizing drops
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b
2.	The IV tubing is pliable and is memory free 
	a. Promotes an accurate and timely amount of medication and volume of fluid delivered 	during patient mobility/change in position.
	b. Evaluator will assess by bending and attempting to crimp the tubing
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b
3.	IV tubing allows an effective priming speed, flow rate and stopcock function
	a. Reduces the amount of time needed for staff to prime tubing with fluid in an urgent 	care setting for patient care needs.
	b. Evaluator will assess by assembling and utilizing IV set (to include stop cock)
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b
4.	The buretrol (or volutrol) graduation allows visualization of an accurate volume level
	a. Promotes an accurate amount of medication and volume of fluid 	delivered to prevent 	fluid overload when indicated.
	b. Evaluator will assess by filling drip chamber and visualizing volume level
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b
5.	Product item package identifies the type of IV tubing set 
	a. Reduces the amount of time needed for staff to select the appropriate size for patient 	care needs
	b. Evaluator will assess by visualizing product item packaging
	c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor [The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. 

It is anticipated that an award will be made on initial offers without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to open up discussions if necessary.

Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

THE CLOSING DATE IS 19 APRIL 2010 4PM EST.

A.	 General Information

The Tri-Service Mid-Atlantic Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, and Air Force medical commands and medical treatment facilities (MTFs) in the states of Virginia and North Carolina announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (REFRIAQ) for the standardization of IV Start Kits. Vendors are required to supply a product line that includes, but is not limited to, the functional equivalent of the products listed below:
 

	Kit IV Start, (at a minimum this kit must contain a Tourniquet-Late Free, Prep Swab or pad, 2x2 Gauze Dressing, Transparent Dressing, Transpore Tape and Extension Set

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to standardize the quality of care across this Region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  The government reserves the right to hold discussions during the process of product standardization.  In addition, the government reserves the right to cancel this standardization action in its entirety if indicated.

The major facilities in the Mid-Atlantic Region include: 1st Medical Group, Langley AFB, VA; 43rd Medical Group, Pope AFB, NC; 4th Medical Group, Seymour Johnson AFB, NC; Womack Army Medical Center, FT Bragg, NC; McDonald Army Community Hospital, FT Eustis, VA; Kenner Army Health Clinic, FT Lee, VA; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, VA; Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, Camp Lejeune, NC; Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point, Cherry Point MCAS, NC.      

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have, or be in the process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor for the Mid-Atlantic Region (Owens & Minor).   This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Mid-Atlantic Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is March 2010. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process:

1.	Vendors will provide an initial response to this FBO posting.  The vendors initial responses will include information requested in the technical/company criteria listed below.  
2.	The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will compile and review the technical/company criteria responses and forward to the Clinical Product Team (CPT) for review.  The technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  
3.	The TRBO and CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company criteria and determine acceptability. 

a.	In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 

Generally, responses to all questions in the technical/company criteria demonstrate that:  
 (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 
 (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

b.	NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.

a.	The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process as well as the price analysis process and will be requested to submit their best product/price discount quotes via an email communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed.

Vendors are required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After review of the technical/company criteria, the Region will eliminate those vendors who fail to meet the criteria.  Vendors who fail to meet the criteria will be notified in writing.

Technical/Company Criteria:

Vendors must provide an initial response to each Technical/Company criterion listed below:

1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of IV Start Kits. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. The ability for the vendor to provide these items is considered critical and failure by them to do so will result in the vendor not being included in this standardization effort.  

a.	At a minimum, a complete product line includes, but is not limited to, the functional equivalent in all sizes of the products below:

	Kit IV Start, (at a minimum this kit must contain a Tourniquet-Late Free, Prep Swab or pad, 2x2 Gauze Dressing, Transparent Dressing, Transpore Tape and Extension Set
	
Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.
2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the IV Start Kits product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
3.	Vendors must have, or be obtaining, a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Owens and Minor) for distribution in the Mid-Atlantic Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.
4.	Vendors must agree to submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  
5.	Vendors must provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address of local vendor representative for the Mid-Atlantic Region. 
6.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the IV Start Kits products, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution. Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation. Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.  The Government will not contact any points of contact provided in response to this question. Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question. 
7.	Vendors must have a return goods policy, and should provide a copy of the policy with the initial submittal responding to this RFQ. 
8.	Vendors must provide a copy of their companys customer service policy and program 
9.	Vendors are required to provide the brands your company manufactures and/or distributes.
10.	Vendors must provide an option to obtain products that are latex-free or otherwise hypo-allergenic.  
11.	Vendors must agree that, when requested, they will provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and competitive product cross reference in electronic Microsoft Excel format 

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation and Pricing Analysis Process:

Upon completion of the Phase I  Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation, vendors who have met the technical/company criteria will progress to the clinical/performance evaluations will be requested to provide product samples and literature concurrent with their best product and price discount quotes being requested. 



Clinical Evaluation Process

For those companies that meet the requirements above, the Clinical Product Team (CPT) will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs). Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs.  Vendor samples must be received no later than 4:00 P.M. (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the request for samples is issued to the vendors. Vendors failing to comply by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.

The samples to be provided will include as a minimum, but not limited to, the functional equivalent of the following products:

 Kit IV Start, (at a minimum this kit must contain a Tourniquet-Late Free, Prep Swab or pad, 2x2 Gauze Dressing, Transparent Dressing, Transpore Tape and Extension Set

1.	To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from the MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria stated below. It is intended that clinical evaluations shall be conducted in a non-clinical setting
2.	The CPT will evaluate the products provided with the clinical/performance criteria identified in this announcement below.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days. CPT teams will evaluate the product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1) -- Not Acceptable; Two (2) -- Minimally Acceptable; Three (3)  Acceptable; Four (4)  Acceptable (High Side); and Five (5) -- Highly Acceptable.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.00 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.00 -- depending on the location of any "break" in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.00, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative. 

Clinical/Performance Criteria:

1. The kit is easily opened and the contents readily assessable
a. Reduces the amount of time needed for staff to establish a stable & sterile IV site.
b. Evaluator will assess by opening and utilizing IV Start Kit contents
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b

2. The kit provides for a stable and secure IV line
a. Provides for reliable IV access for medication delivery, hydration, and blood draw.  
b. Evaluator will assess by opening and utilizing IV Start Kit contents
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b

3. The contents are made of high quality material.
a. Provides for long term reliable IV access thus necessitating fewer needle sticks
b. Evaluator will assess by opening and utilizing IV Start Kit contents
c. This criterion will be evaluated by twice completing the process described in b

Pricing Analysis Process:

1.	Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of pricing requests, to submit RIA pricing quotes, in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the Mid-Atlantic Region.  Pricing must be received at the TRBO by 4:00 PM (EST), fourteen (14) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best product and price quotes.  Failure to respond within this timeframe will result in your company being excluded from further participation/consideration The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor on initial submissions/quotes.  However, the government reserves the right to hold discussions if deemed necessary.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should also contain the vendor's best responses to any other technical and/or company questions listed in this request.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  

2.	Vendors will forward pricing to the TRBO, and the TRBO will prepare a pricing analysis to be reviewed by the TPRB. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).

3.	The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically and clinically equal, price will become more important.

4.	The following elements may be considered in the pricing analysis:  
a.	Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs);
b.	Potential Cost Avoidance, (representing the discount offered by the company from their DAPA and FSS pricing with cost avoidance being the difference between DAPA pricing and RIA pricing multiplied by the number of items purchased over time).   
c.	Impact of Unmatched Lines; and
d.	Consideration of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) by each vendor. The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. 

The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.  The Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Region reserves the right to make a down-selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition. 

It is anticipated that an award will be made on initial offers without discussions; however, the government reserves the right to open up discussions if necessary.


Non-Selected Vendors will be notified in writing regarding selection/non-selection at the conclusion of the completed product evaluation process.

THE CLOSING DATE IS 19 APRIL 2010 4PM EST.

<DESC>This notice addresses a typographical error included on page 3, paragraph 3 of the synopsis that states: within three (5) days.  The text now correctly states: within five (5) days.  

NOTICE OF PROPOSED SOLICITATION

Worldwide Protective Services (WPS)

The U.S. Department of State (DOS) intends to award a multiple award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity contract (IDIQ) to up to six (6) qualified U.S. firms.  DOS anticipates issuing Task and Delivery Orders under the IDIQ comprised of labor hour / day rate, firm-fixed price, and cost-reimbursement components.  
This IDIQ will satisfy anticipated and unanticipated personal protective, static guard, and emergency response team security service requirements worldwide. The IDIQ focuses primarily on DOS requirements in critical or higher than critical threat areas. The anticipated period of performance is one year with four, one-year option periods (to be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government). The NAICS code for these services is 561612. 
At a minimum, offerors must possess ALL of the following listed below: 

A.	A valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance at the time of proposal submission for the base contract. If a firm with a valid Final Secret Facility Security Clearance is selected for award of the base contract, the Government will sponsor that firm for the Top Secret Facility Clearance. However, if for whatever reason, within 60 days of contract award, the firm has not been granted an Interim Top Secret Facility Security Clearance, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract. Similarly, if for whatever reason, within 120 days of contract award, a final Top Secret Facility Security Clearance has not been granted to the contractor, DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract.; and

B.	Have at least two years of experience in managing and operating personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security services programs located in austere and hostile environments overseas (i.e. Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, etc); and

C.	Personal protective, static guard, and emergency response security programs must have a total annual value of at least 15 million dollars; and

D.	Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating guard forces with at least 100 positions (posts) at each location, in multiple locations (different facilities, cities, states, regions, etc.); and

E.	Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating long term personal protective security details for executive level dignitaries; and

F.	Programs must include at least two projects that include managing and operating emergency response teams comprised of at least four members.

The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirements contained in the statement of work for each task order awarded under the IDIQ contract. All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass background investigations conducted separately by the Contractor and the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract. Depending on position, all prime and subcontractor employees performing on this contract must possess either a personnel security clearance or a moderate-risk public trust certification, or have been vetted by the Regional Security Office at the U.S. Embassy where performance is requested (for instance U.S. Embassy Baghdad or Kabul).  Firms that are not eligible for a facility security clearance are NOT ELIGIBLE for award of this contract as the prime contractor, nor can they be selected as a subcontractor if the positions require a personnel security clearance for contract performance.     

SPECIAL NOTES: 

1) All International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and other legal requirements shall be met at the time of contract award.  DOS reserves the right to terminate the contract of a company that is not ITAR compliant.  Contractors shall submit proof of ITAR compliance at the time of contract award; and 

2) DOS reserves the right to reject the proposal of any Offeror that the Government of Iraq or Afghanistan deems ineligible for a Private Security Contractor license, or that is ineligible for any reason to operate as a Private Security Contractor in Iraq or Afghanistan.  Contractors shall submit proof of their legal ability to perform in any country where they are awarded work.

Anticipated Acquisition Schedule

DOS plans to post the complete Request for Proposal to www.fbo.gov approximately fifteen (15) days after this notice, no paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted, offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit a proposal for the IDIQ contract award along with four (4) task order proposals consisting of three (3) operational programs and a local program management office.  The three operational programs include: a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Baghdad, Iraq, a static guard and emergency response team requirement in Kabul, Afghanistan, and a personal protective security service requirement in Jerusalem.  DOS intends to award LPMO Task Orders concurrently to firms that are selected for award of an operational task order.  Offerors who do not submit proposals for the IDIQ and all the Task Orders will not be considered by the Government for award. Offerors will also be required to submit a completely separate proposal detailing expenses to establish an LPMO in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Under this multiple award IDIQ contract, all offerors receiving awards SHALL propose 100% of the time on all task and delivery order requirements throughout the life of the contract.  The Government reserves the right to terminate any contractor for default who fail to conform to this requirement. DOS anticipates contract award approximately sixty (60) to seventy-five (75) days after submission of proposals. As such, offerors shall certify that all proposals SHALL NOT EXPIRE for a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) days after submission to the Government.

The Government will allow interested parties to submit questions to the Government up to April 23, 2010; 1:30 PM EDT after the solicitation is issued.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The work includes furnishing and installing an approximately 400 foot long, non-physical fish dispersal deterrent system anchored to the streambed along the alignment shown on the plates. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The system shall utilize multiple stimuli to divert fish from the Brandon Road Lock into the area defined by the toe of the Brandon Road Dam. The fish will later be harvested from this area by others. The stimuli that make up the fish deterrent system shall include, but are not be limited to air, sound and light. Additionally, the deterrent system shall be powered and controlled from the north bank in an area approximated on Plate 2. The selected bank area has undergone limited clearing and grubbing of a thin stand of trees, but additional clearing will be required. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Some grading and general site preparations will be required to receive a typical construction trailer. The typical construction trailer will be used to house the controls for the fish deterrent system. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The trailer area shall be enclosed by approved security fencing. The system shall include back-up systems such as an electrical power generator and a back-up air compressor.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The air and electrical supply lines running to the deterrent system shall be protected against impacts from debris and water craft.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The fish deterrent system shall be installed in a manner such that it will not be struck by boat keels. </span></p>

Typical design boat draft is nine feet. Cross sections based on soundings data area are included in Plate 1.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The bank upon which the control trailer will sit currently contains an approximately 40-yard wide expanse of trees, but it is not a thick stand of trees. The north edge of the trees is approximately 725 feet from Route 6/Channahon Road. A gravel access road shall be constructed from Route 6 to the work site. See Plate 2.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Should this Agency issue a formal solicitation for these requirements, prospective offerors will be required to submit enough technical information to allow an in-depth technical analysis of their proposed systems. This shall include, but not be limited to plans and specifications. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Additionally, prospective offerors will be required to submit verifiable scientific testing and results data to prove that their system is effective in deterring fish and in particular, Asian Carp.&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><br /><br /></span>Any contract resulting from the solicitation will include a mandatory completion date of 28 October 2010; by this date, the fish deterrent system must be fully operational.</span></p>

Amendment 0002

The purpose of this amendment is to advise industry that effective 2 April 2010, the Government will no longer be accepting requests for a one-on-one session in support of the Combat Vehicle Crewnan Headset (CVCH) Communication Helmet as the maximum number of appointments available for this portion of the conference has been reached.   

The Government will, however, maintain a wait list for members of industry that desire a one-one-one session appointment should a previously scheduled appointment be cancelled. Requests for wait list appointments will be handled in the order in which they are received.  Advanced notification of a scheduled wait list appointment may not be possible, therefore attendees should plan accordingly.   

If you have any additional questions or concerns, please contact Ms. Ebony Guest at Ebony.Guest@usmc.mil/.

<DESC>This posting is for informational purposes only.&lt;P&gt;The Goddard Mesoscale Dynamics and Modeling Group at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center(GSFC) undertake weather-related research utilizing NASA satellite measurements andretrieved products as well as field campaign observations and predictive modeling. &lt;P&gt;A foremost challenge for weather and climate prediction lies in representing clouds andcloud systems in numerical weather and climate models.	This challenge is being met byutilizing a cloud-resolving model (CRM), a computer program that can simulate the lifecycle of clouds and cloud systems.  CRMs simulate clouds and cloud systems at resolutionscomparable to satellite-based cloud diagnostics while having domains comparable toclimate model grid boxes, and thus serve as a unique bridge between the satelliteobservations and climate models. &lt;P&gt;Only a limited number of CRM-simulated cases, however, have been conducted for clouds andcloud systems associated with field experiments over specific geographic locations. Therefore, meteorological products known as large-scale analyses will be used toimprove cloud parameterizations by placing satellite data in a meteorological context andexpanding the range of environmental conditions explored by CRM simulations. In thiscase, large-scale analyses generated by the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office(GMAO) at NASA GSFC and known as the Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research andApplications (MERRA) will be used. &lt;P&gt;The task issued to the performing contractor by NASA/GSFC using ARRA funds will providesupport the Goddard Mesoscale Dynamics and Modeling Group's activities, and the supportrequirements are broken down into three subtasks: &lt;P&gt;(a) Develop MERRA-related software utilities for CRM simulations.  The Goddard MesoscaleDynamics and Modeling Group will provide meteorological datasets (called forcing) for CRMand GMAO single column model (SCM) calculations derived from MERRA. The contractor willextract MERRA data for periods and regions approved by NASA and provide them to NASA, andwill document all results.&lt;P&gt;(b) Conduct high-resolution CRM simulations using MERRA derived data/forcing.  Thecontractor shall document the CRM simulated results and    provide these cloud data toNASA through the Goddard Cloud Library web site. &lt;P&gt;(c) Conduct research on cloud and cloud system structures using NASA satellite data(CloudSat and TRMM missions).  Based upon recommended parameters to be provided to thecontractor by NASA, the contractor will analyze and compare the recommended key physicalparameters for the range of meteorological backgrounds specified.&lt;P&gt;NASA/GSFC awarded a new task 613.1.14-09 under Contract No. NNG06HX18C with ScienceSystems and Applications Inc. (SSAI). Cost Plus Award Fee Contract No. NNG06HX18C wasawarded to SSAI on April 18, 2006, on a competitive basis. &lt;P&gt;Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) was determined appropriate because the contract is for theperformance of research, and uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permitcosts to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.&lt;P&gt;The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note26. &lt;P&gt;An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B". &lt;P&gt;Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<AWARDEE>Educational Testing Service, 666 Rosedale Road, Stop 85D
, Princeton, NJ 08541 US
<DESC>Following the initial announcement on www.fbo.gov of sources sought on September 4, 2009, the National Assessment Governing Board awarded contract # ED-NAG-10-C-0002 on December 22, 2009 to Educational Testing Service (ETS) in the amount of $323,909 to design and implement a study to evaluate the feasibility of using reading achievement levels developed in 1992 for reporting results of the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in reading for grades 4, 8, and 12. This contract was awarded as a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1) as only one responsible source could provide the required services.
<p>The data for this study are secure. As the incumbent contractor with the National Center for Education Statistics, ETS is authorized to conduct data analysis for the secure data collected for the reading assessment. The analyses required to compute the scaled data and to compute and locate the cut scores on the score scale are complex. The 2009 data collection design for reading at each grade includes an unusual data collection design called a braided design, which was designed and implemented by ETS to link score scales and maintain trend. ETS developed the methodology for scaling the data, and is therefore uniquely well-qualified and equipped to perform these analyses for the Governing Board study.</p>
<p>The procedure of item anchoring and developing anchor descriptions was developed by ETS, and ETS has implemented these studies many times. A high level of experience and expertise are needed for this work. Many of the tools and procedures to be used in this work were developed by ETS who has extensive experience in their application. No other company is known to have as much experience with this type of work, and none has as much experience with NAEP. A small-scale preliminary study was conducted in April 2009 to evaluate the feasibility for grades 4 and 8, based on results of the 2008 field trial in reading. The data to be used in this study are for the 2009 operational NAEP at all three grades and will use a different criterion for anchoring items.</p>
<p>A change order now needs to be executed via contract modification to address the following unanticipated requirements:</p>
<p>(1) The draft achievement levels definitions for reading and math need to be revised to address feedback raised by panelists recommending revisions to the descriptions initially established under the original work scope. <br />(2) A special science anchoring study is added to&nbsp;require more information on the relationship between student performance, NAEP policy definitions, and the science achievement levels descriptions.</p>
<p>The procedure of item anchoring and developing anchor descriptions was developed by ETS, and&nbsp;implemented&nbsp;many times by ETS. Their experience and expertise is needed for this work. ETS has extensive experience in constructing NAEP score scales for the 2008 field trial data, computing cut scores for the 2009 data, and implementing the anchor description procedures. ETS can implement the study and produce the results within the time frame needed to inform the Governing Board's policy decisions and actions.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 13.106-1, the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is based on the fact that Educational Testing Service is the only organization that can provide these services, and within the timelines required and needs to be undertaken expeditiously in order to complete the work on schedule. The contract modification value is $140,514.00.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals but a notice to the public of the Governing Board's intent to execute a contract modification, within the scope of the original contract.</p>
<p>The contract performance period is 12/22/2009 to 08/31/2010.</p>

The purpose of this task order (TO) is to assess the overall progress towards the goals of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009.  This evaluation will build on data collected in the separate program evaluations and will examine the interactions of the programs in supporting electronic health record (EHR) adoption and use.  Separate program evaluations will be conducted that focus solely on the effectiveness of the State Health Information Exchange Cooperative Agreement Program, the Regional Extension Center Program, the Beacon Communities Program, and the Information Technology Professionals in Health Care.  This Global evaluation will build on the evaluations of these four programs.  In addition, this global evaluation will entail additional data collection efforts and analysis aimed at assessing the overall impact of the four programs on the adoption and meaningful use of EHRs and on resulting changes in health quality and cost.  

 Due to the nature of the work and uncertainties involved in the contract performance, a fixed price contract action was not appropriate. It was not possible at this time to estimate with any accuracy the extent or duration of the work or what type of other direct costs elements (materials, supplies, equipment, travel, subcontractors, etc.) will be required during performance.  A cost reimbursement type contract was planned/recommended. 

As prescribed in FAR 16.306(a) a cost plus fixed fee type contract will provide for payment of allowable incurred costs and a negotiated fee that is fixed at the inception of the contract the fixed fee does not vary with actual cost, but may be adjusted as a result of changes in the work to be performed under the contract.  This contract type permits contracting for efforts that might otherwise present too great a risk to the contractor, but it provides the contractor only a minimum incentive to control costs.  

As prescribed in FAR 16.301-3 Limitations, the Program Support Centers 2009 Task Order Contractors have accounting systems adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract.

Appropriate Government surveillance during performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and effective cost controls are used as this requirement is also performance based.  The quality assurance surveillance plan provides a 2% task order deduction amount for tasks that are not completed or performed according to the performance standards.

The purpose of this project is to design and conduct a formative and summative evaluation to assess the impact of the Information Technology Professionals in Health Care (Workforce) program.  The program, created under Section 3016 of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009, was intended to provide assistance to institutions of higher education (or consortia thereof) to establish or expand health informatics education programs, including certification, undergraduate, and masters degree programs, for both health care and information technology students to ensure the rapid and effective utilization and development of health information technologies.  

This requirement was competed and awarded as cost plus fixed fee.

<DESC>WVAMC JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLE SOURCE ACQUSITION                ForSentry 8501 Portal Radiation Monitoring System1.  CONTRACTING ACTIVITY.  Veterans Administration Medical Center, Wilmington DE, 1601 Kirkwood Highway2.  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING PROCESSED.  Purchase & installation of Sentry 8501 Portal Monitoring System for ionizing radiation to prevent inadvertent disposal of materials contaminated with radioactive isotopes.  3.  DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED MEETING THE AGENCYS NEEDS.  JRT Instruments Model 8501-CE, self contained, high efficiency radiation monitoring system that includes installation, additional utilities and/or renovation of space to support equipment.4.  STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING SOLE SOURCE ACQUSITION.  10 USC 253(c)(2), Unusual and Compelling Urgency5.  DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE_OF UNUSUAL AND COMPELLING URGENCY AUTHORITY.  Instrument is essential to prevent inadvertent disposal of materials contaminated with radioactive isotopes.  Attempts to control this material administratively have not been successful, resulting in multiple incidents of contaminated materials being detected at the disposal facility.  Failure to purchase and install a monitoring instrument will require patient care service providers to continue to control disposal of some patient-soiled items administratively. Investigation of the most recent incident indicated that efforts to increase the diligence with which administrative controls are practiced have already resulted in increased workload for care givers and have created a negative impact in the quality of patient care, in addition to the potential for HIPAA violations.  Based on prior experience and the professional judgment of health physicists, it is considered unlikely that even the most diligently practiced administrative controls will prevent another incident without monitoring.  In response to the incident investigation, leadership at the VAMC Wilmington Medical Center directed Facilities Service to purchase radiation detection equipment and install it as quickly as possible.  In order to expedite the request from leadership, we are requesting emergency sole source acquisition of the subject equipment, as it has the sensitivity and security features to meet our needs.  Further research or investigation in an attempt to locate additional sources will increase the likelihood of another incident of inadvertent disposal, such that the Government would be seriously injured.6.  DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE.  The proposed source custom builds this detection equipment based on the clients needs and as such, possesses unique qualifications to guarantee that the equipment will meet the Governments needs.  At present no other source is known that can provide this guarantee and continued efforts to find such are counter to use of the authority cited.  This requirement was posted on fedbizopps on 3/10/2010 for seven days stating the Wilmington VA Medical Center intended to enter into a sole source contract with JRT Associates.  There was only one response from Radiation Measurement & Security Instruments.  The COTR (Jim Rasmussen) stated the system from Radiation Measurement & Security Instruments lacked a camera to record the image of someone violating the disposal policy.  It also did not have a touch display at the location where the alarm is located.  The CCR was also searched on 3/10/2010 and this type of radiation system could not be found by any other vendor.7.  DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE.  The contracting officer determines that the anticipated price(s) will be fair and reasonable based on another contract that JRT Associates was awarded on 1/19/2010 from Capital Health System for $21,010.00 for the same system.  This system was also found fair and reasonable by the professional judgment of health physicists and they found the sole source acquisition under the unusual and compelling urgency authority to be justified.8.  DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED.    See #6 above.9.  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.    None10.  A LISTING OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED, IN WRITING, AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION.  Radiation Measurement & Security Instruments.  See Item #6 above.11.  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED.   Post future requirements for radiation equipment on fedbizopps for contractors to respond.12.  CONTRACTING OFFICERS CERTIFICATION.I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. ---Signed---                                                 3/24/2010CHARLES H.

<DESC>The Garrison Chaplain has a responsibility to ensure that a professionally trained and ready Chaplaincy provides religious, spiritual, moral and ethical advice and services to the Fort Jackson Basic Training Mission, tenant organizations, and members of the military community. In an effort to support the Garrison Chaplain's mission, the Government intends to extend the period of performance on the following Chaplain Service contracts: W9124C-07-C-0007 Protestant Musician, W9124C-07-P-0013 Command Master Musician, W9124C-07-C-0003 Catholic Musician, W9124C-07-P-0015 Musician, W9124C-07-P-0016 Musician , W9124C-07-P-0017 Catholic Education Coordinator, W9124C-07-P-0018 Rabbi, and W9124C-07-C-0009 Musician. The period of performance will be extended for a total of six months (01 April 2010 through 30 September 2010). The extensions will allow adequate time to process the follow-on contracts for these requirements.  There are currently nine (9) Chapels on Fort Jackson Army Base that hold weekly religious and spiritual sermons that require the services listed above. Extending the existing Chaplain Service Contracts will aid in the support of accomplishing the mission of providing a seamless Chaplaincy system.

<DESC>Notice of intent to issue a sole source cost modification to contract: HHSS270200700004C / Reference Number 270-07-0191 to:

 Chestnut Health Systems, 1003 Martin Luther King Dr, Bloomington, IL 61701

The purpose of this modification is to provide additional funds to the contract to support the increase in the number of grantee sites for the Assertive Adolescent and Family Treatment (AAFT) grant program, using the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach/Assertive Continuing Care (A-CRA/ACC) treatment protocols from 35 to approximately 70; and the number of grantee sites (including the additional AAFT sites) requiring support for the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) will increase from 147 to approximately 204 covered under this contract.  The ability to add additional sites will be incorporated as additional optional tasks (A and B) to this contract.  Optional Task A will add 10 additional grantee sites; Optional Task B will add 5 additional grantee sites, if exercised, and these optional tasks may be exercised additional times as needed.

The AAFT Grant Program requires the use of the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) and the Adolescent Community Reinforcement (A-CRA) and Assertive Continuing Care (ACC) clinical protocols, while other Division of Services Improvement discretionary grantee sites are encouraged to use these approaches.  The Request for Applications for the AAFT Grant Program specified that the cost of training, monitoring and certification in the GAIN, A-CRA and ACC would be borne by the Federal Government, and for those discretionary grantees in programs other than AAFT that choose to use the GAIN, support services are also required.  Chestnut Health Systems served as the Coordinating Center for the Cannabis Youth Treatment Study in which the GAIN and A-CRA were developed and tested.  Chestnut Health Systems also developed the ACC Protocol.  Chestnut Health Systems holds the copyright for the GAIN and is the sole training organization for the GAIN, A-CRA and ACC.  Training, monitoring, coaching and certification require a national center for overseeing these activities that will be from disparate locations throughout the United States and its Territories.  

The training, monitoring, coaching and certification are in the GAIN assessment and follow up instruments; and the A-CRA, and ACC clinical protocols.  The outcomes of this contract will be nationally trained and certified administrators and trainers of the GAIN, and nationally trained and certified clinicians and clinical supervisors of A-CRA and ACC.  At the end of the training period the grantee sites will be equipped to train and certify their own personnel in the GAIN, A-CRA and ACC.  Chestnut Health Systems will operate and maintain a data base, updated monthly, and forwarded to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration/Center for Substance Abuse Treatment on the progress and implementation of these tools in the designated sites.  

The proposed contract action for additional sites is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capabilities received within forty five (45) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contractor based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>February 9, 2010JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THEN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1. 	Agency:   South Texas Veterans Health Care System (STVHCS), Audie L. Murphy Division and the VISN 17 Contracting Office (10N17/671C), 7400 Merton Minter, San Antonio, TX 78229.2. 	Description of Action:  This justification and approval is for the procurement of non-personal services from HearUSA to provide audiology services for the selected population authorized by the VA Medical Center.  These services have been provided under contract number V671-P4158.  All options to extend the term of the contract and extension of services have been utilized.  An interim contract is being awarded to HearUSA to allow time for the re-compete process and contract award.  The interim will ensure that services continue without out disruption to patient care.  The term of the interim contract will be six months, with an option to extend for six months.3. 	Description of Service:  Contractor shall provide health care providers, medical facilities, medical and other equipment, supplies, and supervision necessary to create, implement and administer audiology and hearing aid dispensing services to meet the specific medical needs of the Veteran.  The Contractor shall be responsible for management of all aspects of the contract. 4. 	Authority:  A purchase contract will be issued to HearUSA in accordance with 41 USC 253 (c) (2);  6.302-2, Unusual and Compelling Urgency; 5. 	Proposed Contractor's Unique Capabilities:  HearUSA is a recognized leader in hearing care and has more than 180 Hearing Care Centers nationwide in addition to nearly 2,000 independently practicing audiologists affiliated with the Hearing Care Network. HearUSA has provided audiology services to the South Texas Veterans Health Care System and are familiar with the computer system, patients, and have provided an acceptable level of care to patients.  HearUSA will be able to assume the workload immediately maintaining the appropriate access to audiology services for Veterans. 6. 	Sources Sought Efforts:  A long term contract is being pursued at this time.  The action will be announced on FedBizOps to promote competition.7. 	Determination of Price Reasonableness:  It is anticipated that the negotiated cost to the Government for this procurement will be fair and reasonable based on previous negotiated pricing offered.8. 	Market Research:  There are no known contracts with the government.  The National Acquisition Center Contract Catalog, and General Service Administration Advantage! websites were viewed with zero results being obtained.9. 	Other Facts:  Recent eligibility reform through the Department of Veterans Affairs has created a significant number of Veterans within the STVHCS's service area who are eligible for audiology and hearing aid prosthetics.  Patient consult numbers have increased from approximately 25 consults in August 2008 to 250 in August 09.  To disrupt service will be a disservice to the Veteran.  HearUSA is a large company, registered in CCR and not on debarred listings.I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.Technical/Requirements Certification:I hereby certify that any supporting data that is the responsibility of the Technical/Requirements personnel and which forms the basis for this justification is accurate and complete.________________//s//____________________    2/16/2010_____Technical/Requirements Personnel Signature	Date________________//s//___________                          _____//s//____________________CHARLES G.
