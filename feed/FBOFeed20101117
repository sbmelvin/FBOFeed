<DESC><p>RECOVERY--PROJECT NUMBER AFCE092878, Anaerobic Bioreactor</p>
<p>The solicitation is being issued under AFCEEBAA-08-001, which can be found at https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=35ca5552a0265591c810430a00b4bdcb&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1 . Offerors must comply with the requirements of the BAA unless they are expressly superseded by this revision.</p>
<p>Because of its unique nature as a RECOVERY ACT requirement, responses are requested for this topic, under the above referenced BAA, on 4:00 PM CST, January 29, 2010.</p>
<p>The Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE) is seeking white papers for an Anaerobic Bioreactor, described below, which is an additional area of interest in alternative energy under their current BAA, that will be awarded as a result of funding under The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 (hereafter referred to as the Recovery Act).</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION<br />Seeking innovative techniques and approaches for the design, fabrication, and demonstration of a bioreactor that utilizes a feedstock of municipal solid waste from an Air Force installation to generate energy and reduce the volume of material deposited to landfills. The project goal will be to implement a scaled demonstration of a process flow that will: 1) process an influent of municipal solid waste that includes glass, metal, plastic and other inorganic solids as well as organic constituents; 2) optimize aerobic and anaerobic biological processes of the organic component to produce recoverable energy; 3) provide economical and sustainable power to an electricity grid to reduce Air Force installation energy costs; 4) significantly reduce the volume of waste deposited to landfills; and 5) produce a marketable by-product if practicable (e.g. compost). A crucial element of the project approach will be to fabricate and demonstrate a scaled bioreactor that will handle a feedstock of municipal solid waste from an Air Force installation comprised of greater than 20 percent solids. Additional organic influent such as wood, paper, grass, and sewage sludge could be utilized to determine an optimal influent composition and treatment regime to reach the stated goals and an acceptable return on investment. The project will also include a comprehensive business case analysis that addresses critical operational factors, to include scalability and cost factors. The purpose of this acquisition is to apply promising demonstration/field-tested innovative technologies and methodologies. This acquisition is not to test theoretical concepts or technologies and methodologies that currently exist solely in a laboratory research and development (R&amp;D) phase.</p>
<p>Phase I offerors submit complete a short questionnaire on the following AFCEE BAA internet site: http://www.afcee.brooks.af.mil/pkv/baa. PHASE I SUBMITTALS ARE DUE NO LATER THAN 4:00 PM CST, 29 JAN 2010. Phase I submittals received after 29 JAN 2010, may or may not be evaluated. To be eligible for award, submission of Phase I is required.</p>
<p>The Phase I proposals are evaluated by the Air Force's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB). Those proposals that are judged innovative and meet program requirements are selected for further evaluation in Phase II. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merits and will not be evaluated against each other. Offerors whose proposals are not selected for Phase II are notified electronically of this decision, while those selected are similarly notified and invited to submit a Phase II proposal as an attachment to the electronic format provided via Internet link. The submittal shall concisely describe the technology and shall be evaluated according to the criteria stated in this announcement. Phase II proposals are to include expanded descriptions/discussion of the following information: <br /><br />(a) Technology or methodology proposed including results of previous development/demonstration/field testing. The technology or methodology must be described in sufficient detail to enable reviewers to understand the nature and probability of successful application. <br />(b) The benefits to the USAF of using the proposed technology or methodology. This should include a comparison with existing technologies or methodologies, and how the proposed technology or methodology is an improvement over existing technologies or methodologies and/or lowers cost. <br />(c) The tasks to be accomplished during the demonstration/field testing, the project schedule, and the location or type of site recommended for the demonstration/field test. <br />(d) The qualifications of the offeror to successfully perform the technology or methodology demonstration/field test. <br />(e) The economic benefit to the United States (e.g. U.S. jobs created or saved; U.S.-sourced manufacturing of materials, supplies, and components; energy independence; or other aspects of the proposed work resulting in economic benefit in the U.S.).<br /><br />Offerors invited to submit a Phase II proposal are provided a link in the electronic notification by which the Phase II proposals are to be submitted. Phase II proposals shall be submitted as attachments to an electronic submittal form that is accessed via the notification from AFCEE. The technical proposal shall be limited to 12 pages, typed at 10 pitch or larger type, single spaced, and single sided, on sheets 8.5" X 11" with 1" margins. This page limitation is inclusive of indexes, photographs, fold-outs, appendices, and attachments. Pages in excess of this limitation will not be evaluated by Government evaluators. Suggested inclusions within the 12 page limitation are: (1) four pages describing the proposed technology or methodology (2) two - three pages to be used as the Statement of Work in any resulting contract. (3) one page containing the economic benefits in the US; as well as the benefits to the Air Force. (4) one page discussing the capability of the offeror, references and point of contact for the demonstration/field test, (5) two pages describing proposed schedule for demonstration/field test, past experience and performance, and other places the technology or methodology has been demonstrated, and (6) one page list of key personnel that will perform the demonstration/field test. <br />The cost proposal has no page limitations; however, offerors are reminded to refer to FAR 15.408 Table 15.2 for guidance. The cost and technical proposals are to be submitted together in Microsoft Word and Excel formats.</p>
<p>No additional data may be submitted for this BAA. If additional data is submitted, it will be discarded. Vendor submittals that meet all of the evaluation criteria will be accepted into the BAA program. Once accepted into the program, the proposal will be shared with appropriate DOD personnel for consideration. The Air Force anticipates awarding two or more contracts. However, the Air Force reserves the right to make multiple awards or no awards. To the maximum extent practicable, any contract(s) awarded using Recovery funds will be awarded as fixed price contracts. However, the Air Force reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of the effort proposed under the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Final selection for award will be based on an evaluation of an offeror's Phase II full proposal (both technical and cost) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to this announcement.</p>
<p>(1) The technical aspect, which is ranked as first in importance, shall be evaluated based on the following criteria which are of equal importance. <br />&bull; New solutions with unique applications to Air Force problems. <br />&bull; Organization, clarity and thoroughness of the proposed SOW. <br />&bull; Technical approach and ability to perform. <br />&bull; The offeror shall demonstrate a clear understanding of how the proposed technology will improve upon current commercially available technologies. <br />&bull; Availability of qualified technical personnel and their experience with the applicable technology. <br />&bull; Past experience with the applicable technology. <br />&bull; Demonstration of economic benefit in the United States (for example: U.S. jobs created or saved; U.S.-sourced manufacturing of materials, supplies, and components; energy independence; or other aspects of the proposed work resulting in economic benefit in the U.S.).<br />&bull; Benefit to the US Air Force</p>
<p>(2) Cost is ranked as second in importance.</p>
<p>No other evaluation criteria will be used. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time</p>
<p>NOTICE ON ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS: Federal agencies are required to include terms and conditions in contract documents necessary to ensure the transparency and accountability objectives of the Recovery Act are met. Section 1512(c) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) requires, as a condition of receipt of funds, quarterly reporting by the prime contractor on the use of funds. FAR Case 2009-0009 is preparing an Interim Rule to be issued in mid-March (effective immediately) to require contractors to report information including, but not limited to the following items:</p>
<p>1.) Government contract / order number<br />2.) The dollar amount of contractor invoices for work funded by recovery act funds<br />3.) A detailed list of all services performed or supplies delivered, including construction, for which the contractor has invoiced, including: <br />a. Program or project title <br />b.

Names and total compensation of each of the five most highly compensated officers for the calendar year in which the contract is awarded (subject to certain conditions)</p>
<p>The Recovery Act and FAR Case 2009-0009 also requires the prime contractor to report specific information on first-tier subcontractors as follows: <br />1) For subcontracts valued &lt; $25,000 or any subcontracts awarded to an individual or to a subcontractor which in the previous tax year had gross income &lt; $300,000, the Contractor shall report the aggregate number of such first tier subcontracts awarded and dollar amount. For first-tier subcontract &gt; $25,000 and not subject to aggregate reporting above:<br /><br />a. Unique identifier (DUNS Number) for the subcontractor receiving the award<br />b. Unique identifier (DUNS Number) for the subcontractor's parent company, if there is one<br />c. Name of the subcontractor<br />d. Amount of the subcontract award<br />e. Date of the subcontract award<br />f. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code<br />g. Funding agency<br />h.

<p>Other terms and conditions related to data collection as well as any mechanisms (including penalties and sanctions) deemed appropriate to avoid impropriety in the use of Recovery Act funding may be incorporated into contracts. Correspondingly, AFCEE will also require data collection with respect to monthly technical and financial Status Reports and a Final Technical Report are required data items.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that additional requirements (i.e., contract clauses, reporting requirements, etc.) may be added to the BAA and/or contract awards that will be applicable to projects funded under the Recovery Act. Such requirements will be included in any contract awarded as a result of this announcement. Requirements include FAR clauses 52.203-15, 52.204-11, 52.244-6, 52.215-2, 52.212-5, 52.225-21, 52.225-22, 52.225-23, 52.225-24.</p>

Army and Navy Working Capital Funds, Operations and Maintenance, Army, and Other Procurement, Army appropriations and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) funds will be utilized for this effort.  The award will be sole source to Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS), 1801 Hughes Drive, Fullerton, CA 92833, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>The U.S. Army, Joint Munitions and Lethality Life Cycle Management Command has a requirement for a modification to the Spider Contractor Logistical Support (CLS) contract (W15QKN-08-C-0517).  It is the Governments intent to solicit, negotiate and award on a sole source basis to the Spider Joint Venture (JV) of Alliant Techsystems, Inc and Textron Systems Corp under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
FAR 6.302-1 is considered applicable as the effort being acquired represents a bridge effort between the System Development and Demonstration and Low Rate Initial Production Phase of the Spider Program  and commencement of full rate production.  The JV is the only contractor capable of performing this bridge effort as award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays resulting in a discontinuation of CLS.  The period of performance for this extension will be approximately six months. 
No Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued with respect to this procurement. This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals. Questions shall be submitted in writing to the U.S. Army JM&L LCMC, Attn: Maria Robertson, Contract Specialist, at maria.robertson@us.army.mil.  TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<a href="mailto:dixie.harper@faa.gov">dixie.harper@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>In accordance with AMS policy 3.2.2.4, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announces the extension of contract DTFAWA-09-C-00073 for Technical, Acquisition, Business, Contract Management and Subject Matter Advice and Assistance Support for the (AJW-54) Voice Switching and Recording (VS&R) Group (AJW-54) and the Air-to-Ground (A/G) Voice Communications Group (AJW-55).  This requirement will be included under the competitive Enterprise Communications Support Services (ECSS) contract which is expected to be awarded within the next 18 months.
The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected vendor using single source procedures and is for informational purposes only.  It's not a Solicitation or Request for Proposal.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals.  
Pursuant to the FAA's Acquisition Management System Policy Guide, Section 3.2.2.4 Single Source Selection is permitted when "such action is determined to be in the best interest of the FAA and the Rational Basis is documented." 
Contract DTFAWA-09-C-00073, is awarded to CEXEC, Inc.  The extension has an estimated value of $6,995,448.77 with a period of performance from February 1, 2011 to January 31, 2012, and an option to add six (6) months from February 1, 2012 to July 31, 2012.  
The Contractor is required to continue performance under the contract by providing quality technical, acquisition, business, contract management, and subject matter expertise. This continued effort also provides continued support to the ATC Communications Services' mission. 
A competitive procurement for the effort under contract DTFAWA-09-C-00073 is not feasible due to time restraints (ECSS will be awarded within eighteen months), the cost of a new procurement as well as the time required to transition from one vendor to another. 
CEXEC, the incumbent Contractor, has been providing support to the ATC Communications Services Program for the last several years and is the only known source able to satisfy the requirements within the needed timeframe.  CEXEC possesses the unique qualifications, technical benefits, experience, past performance, expertise, and cost benefits to support the proposed requirements.  It is concluded that a single source contract with CEXEC represents the lowest risk and lowest cost for the FAA as well as, the overall best value in order to meet the FAA's interim needs until ECSS completes the procurement process.
Any questions regarding this announcement must be directed to Whitney Coleman-Clark, Contract Specialist, by 12:00 PM EST, November 30, 2010, via email at whitney.coleman-clark@faa.gov.

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation is to obtain GIS Units as defined in the solicitation, for local, Regional, and Nationwide fire suppression, and all-hazard incidents.  We anticipate issuing the solicitation approximately 15 days after the date of this notice.  The Government anticipates awarding multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements.A single, national solicitation will be issued to obtain these services.  This solicitation will be issued using the Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system and to use VIPR, you must have access to a computer and the internet.  Basic information you will need to be aware of to participate in this solicitation is located on the web at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.User guides and other information regarding VIPR are posted at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.phpIn addition to the basic requirements referred to above, there are two very important things you must do in order to submit an offer utilizing the VIPR system:1) Download Formatta Filler software to be able to view the solicitation package and complete the online forms used in submitting your offer.  A link to this software and installation instructions are available at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendorsupport.php.2) Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication.   Users play a key role in ensuring that information requested for VIPR is protected.  The government now requires a higher level of security for information transmitted by individuals to the government for electronic business (including that conducted by VIPR).  Therefore, the Forest Service requires secure user accounts through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Level 2 eAuthentication system.  Only individuals from your company who plan to sign the preseason incident agreement(s) must obtain a Level 2 eAuthentication account.  The Level 2 credentials go beyond simply applying for an account online - Level 2 also ensures that your identity is verified in-person, and by doing so, helps prevent identity theft or fraud.   The Forest Service has prepared numerous resources to assist vendors in obtaining a Level 2 eAuthentication account, which are posted to the Forest Service Incident Procurement (IP) website:  http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/vendors.php.

<SUBJECT>Technical Assistance to Support HRSA/BPHC Grantees and BPHC Federal Staff
<SOLNBR>HRS51861

<CONTACT>Debora Ann Pitts, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-3789, Fax 301-443-6038, Email dpitts@hrsa.gov
<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is soliciting proposals from 8(a) businesses to provide supplemental expert assistance and support to Health Resources &amp; Services Administration's Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) grantees and BPHC Federal staff in a range of areas. This is a 8(a) Competitive Set-A-Side. To support the expedited implementation needs and the success of new and expanded grantees, BPHC needs to quickly expand its capabilities to deploy knowledgeable consultants to help train new BPHC staff as quickly as possible, and diversify the range of in-person and Web-based technical assistance (TA) approaches utilized to accelerate the quality implementation and performance improvement challenges and opportunities facing BPHC-funded grantees. The primary purpose of this contract is to provide technical and consultative assistance in the form of on-site visits, document reviews, video/phone consultation, and/or on-line/Web-based TA to new and existing BPHC-funded grantees. The assistance provided will focus on key primary health care areas including conducting needs assessments, providing high quality services, health center management and finance, governance, strategic planning, strong operations, management information systems, management and staff development, recruitment and retention, risk management, Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) coverage, performance measurement and improvement, quality assurance and improvement, and clinical practice management. The second purpose of this contract is to provide timely, coordinated, and strategic management and training support to BPHC staff. This support will help staff learn individually and collectively how to improve work processes, increase grantee and employee satisfaction, promote effective knowledge transfer, and provide enhanced technical and programmatic support to BPHC-funded grantees. The NAICS Code is 541611 with a small business standard of $7 million.
<p>The mission of the Bureau of Primary Health Care is to improve the health of the Nation's underserved communities and vulnerable populations by assuring access to comprehensive, culturally competent, quality, primary health care services. The BPHC serves as a national leader in efforts to assure the delivery of community-based primary health care services to residents of medically underserved areas and to special populations. BPHC also assists States in providing health care to underserved populations through primary and preventive care programs. These programs are vital to strengthening the "safety net" that underinsured, uninsured, and Medicaid beneficiaries rely on for essential primary health care services. Through competitive project grants, BPHC provides funding to help state, local, public, and private entities meet the health care needs of underserved communities and vulnerable populations such as homeless individuals, residents of public housing projects, school children, pregnant women and infants, border residents, and the elderly. The contractor shall provide supplemental expert assistance and support to BPHC-funded grantees and BPHC Federal staff in a range of areas. This assistance and support will include on-site and off-site TA for new start grantees and continuing BPHC-funded grantees (e.g., health centers, national cooperative agreements, state and regional primary care associations, FQHC Look Alikes, etc.). It could include a range of activities such as initial new start visits, grantee operational assessments, follow-up or urgent TA site visits, financial recovery plan reviews, and other types of T/TA support. This assistance is intended to enhance overall primary health care program performance and management for all grantee activities supported by BPHC.</p>
<p>The Government is seeking access to expert consultants who are qualified and experienced in a range of specialty areas related to community-based primary care service delivery, which will include, but not be limited to, clinical care and practice management, public health, administration and finance, governance, managed care, training, integrated delivery systems, health care provider recruitment and retention, management and staff development, needs of special populations, information systems, risk management, and such other specialty areas as may be determined by the BPHC Project Officer (PO). The contractor shall assist BPHC staff in selecting and arranging for experts for site visits, trainings, and/or other TA-related projects. The contractor will develop an automated Web-based TA request submission and tracking system for expediting the transmission of requests and for providing the most current status (both TA information and financial tracking) of every expert TA activity supported by the contract. This automated database tracking system will be developed to interface with the current BPHC consultant database system so that BPHC staff can seamlessly work between these two systems. The contractor shall create and have available a roster of expert consultants that are geographically, racially, ethnically, and linguistically diverse as well as represent the range of areas of expertise listed in Section C.3.B. The contractor shall develop a process for verifying that the experts are competent and up-to-date in their fields. Experts will be from or familiar with the region or state (e.g., possessing knowledge of the state's public health, health care, and health policy environment) in which they are providing a technical assistance, training, or assessment site visit, whenever possible. The experts will also be familiar with the programs they are assessing and the Federal statutory and regulatory standards pertaining to those programs. The BPHC will also provide lists of possible expert consultants for consideration by the contractor. The Government anticipates award of a contract consisting of a twelve month base period and four (4) option years to include 22 OPTIONAL TASK per year. Offers from concerns other than 8(a) businesses will not be considered. This is a pre-solicitation notice and not a request for proposals. The solicitation document (RFP) will be posted at this site www.fedbizopps.gov within fifteen (15) days of this notice and can be downloaded by looking under the main menu for HHS/Office-Health Resources and Services Administration/locations-Office of Acquisition Management Policy, Contracts Operation Branch. The closing date for receipt of proposals will be approximately thirty (30) days after issuance/posting of the RFP. It shall be the offeror's responsibility to monitor this website for the RFP and any amendments to the RFP. The agency will consider proposals from all responsible 8(a) sources. The contact person for this acquisition is: Debora A. Pitts, Division of Contract Services, OAMP/HRSA, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 13A-19, Rockville, MD 20857-5600; phone number 301-443-3789 or 443-2750; FAX 301-443-6038.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to HighRes Biosolutions Inc, 299 Washington Street, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801-2795 to procure the service to disassemble, relocate and modify an existing HighRes Biosystem Robot. The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC), Robotics Center is severely limited in available space and to make room for the new robotics system the existing HighRes Biosystem Robot needs to be relocated.  The relocation of the system requires the services of the manufacturer of the system to ensure the relocation is accomplished with no damage to the robot and that the system performs to specifications after the move.  

High Resolution Engineering (HRE) will dismantle, relocate and then install the BSL2 Microcell system into a temporary location within the existing Kalypsys High Throughput Screening Robotic area. By relocating this existing HRE System, NCGC will be able to obtain additional custom solutions for the ongoing needs of our screening facility here at NCGC for compound storage and replication. HRE has extensive in-house experience designing and fabricating, and relocating these unique and extremely sensitive proprietary systems that have several unique robotic configurations within the BSL2 controlled environment enclosures. Flexibility and customization are key elements of our existing robotic system that was manufactured by HRE.  Since so many of our ongoing assay screening projects are unique and dependent on the use of this system, having the flexibility to custom fit the screening needs into this area will allow us to increase productivity while maintaining compound integrity.  Many of the proposed features will be essential to the increased productivity, but maintaining the integrity of the custom docking stations that will allow top-feeding incubators and carousels to be moved to and from the cell in a matter of seconds will be essential to the changing needs of our assay development. 

This proposed move and configuration will enhance the screening capabilities of NCGC robotic center immensely by providing the clinical grade clean room environment that will continue to allow us to provide screening on assays currently not available on our existing robot.  The HRE Robot, used for BioSafety Level 2 screening assays, needs to be relocated in the Kalypsys room to allow space for an additional Aspect robotic system. The BSL2 MicroCell can only be moved by HighRes Biosolutions due to the software configuration with robotic arms and ancillary dispensers, sealers, centrifuges, and incubators that are working inside the custom lateral flow enclosure. The existing system features Trespa surfaces and epoxy-coated robots to avoid bioloading. This proposed system relocation by HRE will maintain the integrated sealed incubators and microplate storage that move to and from the system via carts and mate with MicroDock docking stations. In addition, this relocation will maintain the custom process to store solid and liquid waste in a sealed environment from which the waste can be removed by an operator. The relocation must maintain the innovative docking station integrity that offers us the modularity and flexibility we need to perform our complex assays, and allowing us to easily change system configurations when new technologies are available.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 339999, All Other Miscellaneous General Purpose Machinery Manufacturing, with business size standard 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-46 (October 29, 2010). 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by November 20, 2010, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

Inquires to this announcement,  referencing synopsis number NHLBI-PB-(HG)-2011-024-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, Procurement Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Dorothy Maxwell.  Response may be submitted electronically to maxwelld@mail.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted.  Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>This is a sole source procurement pursuant to MOU with Jacksonville Port Authority to provide for emergency berthing of disabled U.S. Navy ships during destructive weather identified as tropical storms and hurricanes by the National Weather Service (NWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The NWS and NOAA provide advanced warning of hurricanes.  A Hurricane watch is issued whenever a hurricane becomes a threat to coastal areas.  A hurricane warning is issued when hurricane winds of 64 miles per hour or higher, or a condition of dangerously high water and very rough seas are expected in a specific coastal area within 35 hours.  The Port of Jacksonville and the Mayport Naval Station Port are not considered hurricane havens because surrounding low topography does not provide an adequate wind break to provide some sheltering from southerly and southeasterly winds.
  The Jacksonville Port Authority Talleyrand Marine facility would be utilized to provide shelter from destructive winds and hurricane conditions.  The period of performance is for a base year of 12 months with four (4) one-year options to extend services.  This is a Firm Fixed Price type contract and issued on an "unrestricted basis."
The RFP will be uploaded separately under NECO.  All information regarding this RFP must be submitted in writing to Karen.Donald@navy.mil.  No phonecalls will be entertained.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with PANalytical Inc. for the purchase of one replacement Super Sharp Max Rh X-ray tube (4kw, 160mA) for a PANalytical Wavelength Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer to perform sulfur analyses in commercial fuels and blendstocks. US EPA requires a replacement x-ray tube, installed into the existing X-Ray Spectrometer and capable of sulfur detection limit of 0.3 PPM or less, variable source power maximum value of 4kw, meeting all requirements of ASTM method D2622 and an x-ray tube window thickness of 75 microns maximum.  PANalytical Inc. is the only known U.S. supplier of such an x-ray tube.  
However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA?s requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 334517.  Please submit your request in writing to Annette Niedermier by e-mail to niedermier.annette@epa.gov.  No telephone requests or request by fax will be honored.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with AVL North America for the upgrade of the AVL GEM 110 gas lab analyzer bench and client bottle naming software.  This upgrade also involves relocating the data base from a remote server to the gas lab IFC computer to allow network connectivity throughout the lab. US EPA requires this upgrade to enhance connectivity, improve traceability, and reduce data entry errors to the bottle naming software.  Due to the proprietary nature of both the testing equipment and software, AVL North America is the only known U.S. supplier with the ability to provide the upgrades.  
However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA?s requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS A FORMAL SYNOPSIS OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.2.  THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 19.5.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is seeking to acquire medical countermeasures (MCM) that will support an effective public health medical emergency response.  The United States Government (USG) contemplates award of a five year Firm Fixed Price type contract for MCMs that can specifically provide treatment courses for symptomatic individuals exposed to smallpox.  It is the goal of the forthcoming RFP to obtain advanced development products, i.e., at a development level, as classified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which are in no less than the clinical study phase of the Investigational New Drug (IND) process as well as those products which already have approved therapeutic indications.  Prior to the submission of the proposal, the Offeror must have met with the appropriate review division at the FDA to consult on the appropriate path for approval of their respective therapeutic for use in pathologies known to be associated with, or as components of, a Smallpox antiviral drug.  It is the goal of BARDA to place a Smallpox Antiviral drug in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) as a Final Drug Product (FDP) which can be used for the treatment of individuals who are symptomatic. 
 
The desired product that will be acquired with this contract must be able to support a public health medical emergency.  Thus an obligation of this acquisition is to acquire a FDP that can support the potential use of the antiviral drug product during a declared emergency under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).    Other requirements:  (1) for achieving approval, have demonstrated efficacy in a variola challenge in the appropriate animal models (see FDA Draft Guidance for Industry, Smallpox (Variola) Infection: Developing Drugs for Treatment and Prevention); (2) delivery of 1,700,000 treatment courses of FDP of smallpox antiviral drug to the SNS; (3) Be in unit-of-use dosing or other approved packaging that requires no more than three doses per day for up to 21 days; (4) have a minimum expiry period of 36 months of stability and a target of 32 months remaining when delivered to the SNS; (5) have approval for symptomatic adults (18-64 years of age); (6) for achieving additional approved label and extended expiry dating, the USG reserves an option for the following concept plans to (a) support approval of an IV formulation for severely ill in; (b) to support liquid formulation for pediatric and geriatric populations; and (c) to manufacture and control antiviral drug production on a large scale to deliver up to an additional 12 million course.  It is imperative that the Offeror(s) to this RFP seek guidance from the FDA prior to submission of their proposals so the proposal may be aligned with current FDA policy, practices and guidance.

Additional details and requirements will be described in the Smallpox Antiviral solicitation, RFP-BARDA-09-35 which will be made available electronically through FEDBIZOPPS on or about February 24, 2009.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal to be considered by the USG.  This notice does not commit the USG to the award of a contract.  Only written or email requests will be accepted directly from the requestor for this solicitation.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.  All responses should be identified with the respective solicitation number RFP-BARDA-09-35, name of company, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address of Point of Contact (POC), should be submitted to the Contracting Office address identified in this notice.  The contract award resulting from this solicitation will have an estimated award date of September 2009.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This RFI is ISSUED for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any firm's ability to submit an offer if, or when, a solicitation is released. The requested information is for planning purposes only and does NOT constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this RFI. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations. Formal notices will be on http://www.fbo.gov/ website.
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION: The Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE), Lackland AFB, TX is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for the next follow-on Independent Science, Engineering, and Acquisition Support (ISEAS) contract. This contract is for Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) of the highest technical degree, in extremely selective domains not relevant to AFCEE's large-scale A&amp;AS execution-leveraging, known as Global Engineering Integration and Technical Assistance (GEITA). AFCEE's ISEAS contract capability and needs have been and still are extremely limited with respect to volume (less than seven percent of AFCEE's overall A&amp;AS expenditures). AFCEE's ISEAS contract capability has existed since its earliest organizational days (early 1990s), and, since 1998, has been harnessed through four successive non-competitive direct award contracts under 10 U.S.C. 2304(3), as implemented in FAR 6.302.3 &lsquo;to maintain an essential capability provided by an educational or other non-profit institution or a federally funded research and development center'. Factors such as the specifics of this unique portion of AFCEE's overall A&amp;AS requirements, how they manifest themselves, the interactive stakeholder and operative domains prevalent in the requirements' framework, and, most importantly, the absolute need for renowned, universally credible highest technical operatives, mandates that AFCEE continue to harness an ISEAS capability such as it has for its entire tenure. In these relatively small areas of endeavor, AFCEE's ability to engage in and contribute to the success of DoD's programs that fall within its charter hinges on its access to and employment of a highest-level science and engineering arm which is totally independent in its corporate profile; totally free of organizational conflict with regards to other firms traversing AFCEE's and DoD's vast mission landscape; autonomous in how it receives, processes, and engages in the various tasks germane to its scope; totally non-competitive with regards to Government work; and accepted as bias-free, totally objective and immediately credible in how they exert their technically defensible contributions in support of AFCEE's mission. Accordingly, AFCEE anticipates a direct award (Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity with Cost-Plus Fixed-Fee pricing arrangement, basic ordering period of three years with one additional year for completion of performance) pursuant to continuing the same ISEAS mission support objectives. The NAICS code for this work is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services. The program ceiling for this contract is estimated to be $20 million for the three year total spanning 2011 through 2013. Answers to the following questions will help AFCEE determine if a competitive environment has developed for this type of support contract.</p>
<p>AFCEE requests comments to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What are industry's experiences (i.e. your firm's experiences) supporting the types of technical functions and domains, in totality, prescribed in the attached PWS, and further addressed in the following questions, with the high technical levels of effort and resources necessary to fulfill AFCEE's needs relevant to the &lsquo;recognized expert', corporate autonomy, and conflict and bias-free nature of the ISEAS' independent standing and mission role?</p>
<p>2. If in your firm's profile, question # 1 seems to be covered (i.e. favorable), what is your firm's historical maximum work load and range of dispersion of work performed simultaneously? For whom did your firm provide these services, and under what type of contract?</p>
<p>3. If in your firm's profile, question # 1 seems to be covered (i.e. favorable), tell us how you would manage and perform the full scope of AFCEE's ISEAS requirements, including the manner of interaction with AFCEE and its customer and stakeholder base relevant to subject functions/domains and the associated requirements' manifestation (individual examples of technical functions/domains are portrayed in question numbers four through 10 below).</p>
<p>4. What are your firm's experiences in providing scientists, risk-assessors, and engineers considered leaders in their fields with reputations beyond reproach in supporting technical evaluation and transfer through independent engineering evaluation and assessment of technical data associated with the deployment of leading edge environmental technologies and controversial topics such as appropriate cleanup standards for environmental contaminants? If your firm has this experience and capability, has your firm done this work in the DoD ERA program, the MMRP, and the One Cleanup program?

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Propulsion Directorate, Thermal Sciences and Electrochemical Branch (AFRL/RZPS) will be hosting an Industry Day to provide information on the upcoming Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) on the Small Unmanned Renewable enerGy long Endurance Vehicle (SURGE-V) Development Program. The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) have a growing need to extend mission persistence for both hand-launched and air-launched Group 1 (&lt;20 lbs) small unmanned aerial systems (SUAS). Traditionally, Group 1 systems have been limited by their endurance and payload capabilities primarily due to the limited energy density of traditional power sources at that size scale. The goal of the SURGE-V program will be to develop a hybrid power/propulsion system in combination with a Group 1 tactical SUAS platform that enables multiple DoD missions sets of loiter-"search"-loiter with a 2+ lb plug-and-play advanced payload while maintaining long endurance (4+ hour) operation. This program shall demonstrate the SUAS platform with integrated power system that is "field-proven" in an operational environment by the end of the proposed effort.
<p>Industry Day is scheduled to be held at the Tec^Edge Innovation and Collaboration Center (5000 Springfield Street, Dayton, OH; http://www.wbi-icc.com/icc/) on 1-2 December 2010. Interested participants must pre-register for Industry Day by confirming via email to Mr. Michael Rottmayer (Michael.Rottmayer@wpafb.af.mil) no later than 29 November 2010. Note: Beverages and snacks will be available for purchase: $0.50/item; unlimited beverages $3.00/day; or unlimited beverages/snacks $5.00/day. The Government will not compensate Industry Day participants for travel, lodging or any other expenses associated with attending this event.</p>
<p>A general session is tentatively scheduled on the first day (1 Dec 10) with details of the program as well as presentations from the users on needs and requirements, followed by a Q&amp;A session in the afternoon. One-on-one sessions, approximately 30 minutes long, will be offered on the second day of the event (2 Dec 10). For planning purposes, companies interested in conducting one-on-one meetings are encouraged to notify Mr. Rottmayer prior to the Industry Day event. However, a sign-up sheet will be available at the registration table. A more definitive agenda will be posted at a later date.</p>
<p>Additionally, we encourage submission of any questions/comments/concerns to Mr. Rottmayer no later than 26 November 2010 to allow for discussion/response at the Industry Day. Please note that any information provided in the response will NOT be treated as propriety, unless specifically stated otherwise.</p>
<p>Conference attendance is limited to U.S. citizens. All U.S. citizen attendees are required to confirm citizenship in the Registration email.</p>
<p>Please Note: U.S. active duty military personnel and civilian employees of the United States are exempt from the following certification requirements.</p>
<p>The material to be presented and discussed at the SURGE-V Industry Day will involve technical data and information that is governed by DOD Directive 5230.25, "Withholding of Unclassified Technical Data from Public Disclosure." Only individuals or enterprises certified under DOD Directive 5230.25 are eligible to obtain access to unclassified technical data with military or space applications in the possession of, or under the control of, the DOD.</p>
<p>SURGE-V Industry Day attendees must determine if their employer already has a certification on file that extends to all employees. If an employer already has a certification on file, attendees are not required to recertify. However, you must return a copy of the approved company certification (DD Form 2345, "Military Critical Technical Data Agreement") along with the registration email. The DD Form 2345 can be found at the following link: http://www.power.utcdayton.com/media/DD2345.pdf.</p>
<p>If a certification is not on file, either the attendee or the employer must request certification by completing the attached DD Form 2345 (MAR 2005) and submit the form to the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, Defense Logistics Services Center, Federal Center, 74 Washington Avenue, N, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084. The attached DD Form 2345 may be duplicated. Specific instructions for completion and submission are on its reverse side. Processing time of the DD Form 2345 by the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office is approximately two weeks. That office will notify each company's security officer by mail if the company's request for certification has been approved. Inquiries concerning application approval should be directed to the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office at (800) 352-3572, or visit the website at www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp.</p>

<p>12. The US Air Force Space Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS) is conducting market research through this Sources Sought Synopsis for the future sustainment of the SBIRS system; the estimated value for sustainment for FY13 is $100M and FY14 and beyond is $150M.</p>
<p>SBIRS contributes to the Department of Defense mission to deter war and protect the security of the U.S. by providing timely and accurate missile warning/defense information. The SBIRS systems are critical for protection against global and theater ballistic missile attacks against the U.S., its deployed forces, and its allies. SBIRS supports the missions of the National Command Authority, North American Air Defense Command, and US Strategic Command. SBIRS has a FAD 1-1 priority rating (the highest).</p>
<p>The SBIRS Space program consists of Defense Support Program (DSP), Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites and payloads, and Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) satellites and payloads. The SBIRS ground system consists of a Mission Control Station (MCS), Interim Mission Control Station Backup (IMCSB), Mission Control Station Backup (MCSB), Survivable Mission Control Station (SMCS), worldwide Relay Ground Stations (RGS), Readout Station Application (RSA), Ground Communication Network Modernization (GCNM), and the Mobile Ground System (MGS) including the SBIRS Survivable Endurable Evolution (S2E2). Mission critical information is exchanged between the Mission Control Stations and the RGSs via commercially provided communication lines. A ground system upgrade scheduled for FY16 will include Mission Control Stations for homogeneous processing of all DSP, HEO, and GEO payloads and will retire the legacy Increment 1 and monotrack ground stations and baselines. The RGS will also be upgraded for the HEO and GEO payloads. Effort will include any required deltas between Increment 1 and the ground system upgrade and any required transition or integration activities for the DSP/SBIRS legacy and follow-on ground system. Support is also provided to the Operations Migration Capability (OMC), its applications, and subsequent Assessment Sub-Elements (ASE).</p>
<p>Two levels of Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) Operational and Maintenance support are currently performed at the ground sites and for on-orbit satellites:</p>
<p>Level 1 provides Operations Support and Sustainment (OS&amp;S) of the Operational SBIRS entities to maintain required levels of system availability and reliability. On-Site OS&amp;S includes Real-time Crew Positions integrated into AF Operational Crews (24x7) including Ground Systems Engineers (GSE), Satellite System Engineers (SSE), Mission Technical Analyst (MTA), Flight Operations Support (FOS), Vehicle Operations Engineers (VOE) and Hardware Maintenance Technicians/Engineers (HMT). On-site maintenance includes all government furnished communications and equipment, Consolidated Maintenance Control (Job Control) for SBIRS and DSP Legacy equipment. Additionally there are other On-Site support functions provided 24x7 and a Day Staff from 8 to 5 that provides System Administrators, Data Base Administrators, Logistic and Inventory Control, System Schedulers, Operations and Site Integration, Media Control, Operational Test Team support to the Mission, and Management and Administration Support.</p>
<p>Level 2 ground Hardware and Software Depot and Systems Support is a centralized Depot that provides Management and Technical Leadership, hardware, software, logistical and systems engineering to Operational Sites. The Software Depot includes Software Engineering, Systems Engineering, Configuration Management, Integration and Test, Quality Assurance and Emergency and Unscheduled Depot Level Maintenance Actions (EDLM/UDLM). The Hardware Depot provides Hardware Engineering, Failure Analysis, Vanishing Vendor/Obsolescence, Vendor Monitoring, Replacement and Service Life Extension Engineering, Reliability, Maintainability, and Dependability (RM&amp;D) Analysis, Spares Analysis, Spares Replenishment, Inventory Control, Shipping and Supply Chain Management, Quality Assurance, Configuration Management and Security Accreditations - Risk assessments for security vulnerabilities performed as an accreditation and re-accreditation process.</p>
<p>Level 2 space depot (Satellite factory) support is required for the DSP, HEO, and GEO spacecraft and sensors. This includes spacecraft and sensor trending, analysis, anomaly investigation and recovery. Technical support to the SBIRS constellations include Satellite Engineering, and On-Orbit Support to include trending analysis, anomaly resolution, root cause determination, and implementation of corrective actions. Facilities, test and development systems and equipment must be shared between follow-on HEO and GEO production, replenishment and Operational support and sustainment.</p>
<p>This contract will also provide modification development, integration, installation and testing on the existing operational system. It will also include exploitation/quick reaction/rapid prototyping of new and existing capabilities.</p>
<p>Most functions require TS/SCI personnel and facilities' clearances.</p>
<p>The current contractor for SBIRS sustainment and development is Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company (LMSSC) and the current contractor for the Defense Support Program is Northrop Grumman. The SBIRS Follow-On Production (SFP) contract is sole source to LMSSC. Interested parties who believe they have the capability to perform as a prime contractor in support of this effort must submit a Statement of Technical Capabilities (SOC), which includes the following information: Personnel/Size Standard - Company Name, Mailing Address, Point of Contact and Telephone Numbers, Business Size Classification, Large, Small, or Other, and experience-specific work previously performed or being performed relevant to this follow-on effort. Small Business companies with the capability to perform this requirement are encouraged to participate. The small business size standard for this requirement is NAICS code 541712, (Size Standard 1,000). The Government is requesting submissions from potential prime contractors, and will not be responding to submission for only subcontracting opportunities. The SOC shall not exceed eleven pages which includes a one page cover letter, with a 1.25 margin and the font size not less than 11 pt. The government will use this SOC to determine if there is sufficient interest in the marketplace from qualified sources to attempt full and open competition.

<SOLNBR>CP-11-17-10-01
<RESPDATE>121710
<CONTACT>Stephanie Blake, Phone 571-226-4620 , Fax 703-208-7326, Email sblake@nish.org
<DESC>On behalf of AbilityOne Program NISH, a designated central nonprofit is pursuing a potential partnerships with commercial manufacturers of Salad Oils (Canola and Soy) for the purpose of providing employment opportunities for people who are blind or severely disabled. If successful, the result will be a Co-Branding Agreement between the manufacturer and the AbilityOne Program, and its registered brands. The ultimate expectation is that the co-branded product will be placed on the Committee's Procurement List (PL).
<p>The manufacturers will be nationally (or regionally) recognized suppliers of edible oils and will supply two NISH Food Producing Non-profit Agencies, located in Rochester, NY (Salad Oil, Canola) and Cookeville, TN (Salad Oil, Soy) who will package, pack, label, mark, unitize and distribute 100% of the annual requirement of these oils to all four branches of the U.S. Military and other Federal Customers, through the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Prime Vendor Program. The Non-profit Agencies will provide world-wide distribution to CONUS and OCONUS locations.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the following criteria must be met (proposals must address all criteria):</p>
<p>1. Possession of a nationally (or regionally) known brand name that can be demonstrated to have significant appeal through evidence of substantial sales.<br /><br />2. U.S. manufacturer of commercial-off-the-shelf Salad Oil (Canola and Soy). These oils include Soybean, Winterized Soybean, and Canola (Rapeseed). Future oils may include but are not limited to corn, cottonseed, peanut, and sesame oils (additional, future oils types are not guaranteed). Interested manufacturers do not need to supply all oil types. Therefore, multiple manufacturers may be selected. However, preference may be given to manufacturers of all oil types (Canola and Soy).</p>
<p>3. The Salad Oils must meet and/or exceed Federal Government and Industry published standards.</p>
<p>4. The chosen manufacturers must be willing to set a high priority for delivering the oils to two NISH Food producing Non-profit Agencies in order to assure on-time deliveries to the U.S. Military through the DLA Troop Support Prime Vendor Program. In the event of Surge or Full Scale Mobilization, the oil suppliers must be willing to provide up to 300% of the annual requirement of 40,000 Cases of Salad Oil, Canola and 13,000 Cases of Salad Oil, Soy. Canola oils will be delivered to Rochester, NY. Soy oils will be delivered to Cookeville, TN.</p>
<p>5. A Certificate of Conformance must be provided for all in-bound oils.</p>
<p>6. A willingness to enter into a multi-year agreement which includes on-going technical and production assistance and the necessary factory trained technical field support while enabling the Non-profit Agencies to meet the criteria of the AbilityOne Program to package, pack, label, mark, unitize and distribute the products to the U.S. Military and other Federal Customers, thereby creating employment for people who are blind or severely disabled.</p>
<p>7. Commitment to working independently with the Non-profit Agencies to market products to the Government customers under the AbilityOne Program. Preference may be given to manufactures that have a dedicated team for Federal Government Sales and Marketing.</p>
<p>8. Willingness to work with the NISH Non-profit Agencies selected for this Addition and the Committee to ensure that the price to the end-users is a fair and reasonable. Pricing will negotiated on a quarterly basis with DLA Troop Support and will be derived from the New York Board of Trade or appropriate market indicator.</p>
<p>9. Manufacturers' submissions must demonstrate that proposed products meet the various criteria noted.</p>
<p>10. Geographic location: Preference may be given to a Co-Branding Partner that is strategically located in close proximity to the aforementioned cities, as the Non-profit Agencies may be interested in a Cooperative Arrangement with Industry (CAI). A CAI is an arrangement between a Nonprofit Agency and a commercial firm when a Nonprofit Agency utilizes a commercial firm's plant, equipment or personnel in the production of a commodity under the AbilityOne Program. Any cooperative arrangement with a commercial firm must effectively set apart the Nonprofit's activities and operations at the commercial plant/location so as to create clear guidelines for use of leased commercial facilities and services, which are under the Nonprofit's complete control and direction. In this case, the Nonprofit Agency will have leased facilities for the total control of the line to complete one or more of following production tasks for the salad oils: packaging, packing, labeling, marking, unitizing, and/or distributing. The resulting arrangement is captured in a Cooperative Agreement with Industry (developed and approved in compliance with Committee's Operations Memorandum 21-www.abilityone.gov&#61664;Policy-Plans).</p>
<p>11. Past performance: Manufacturers with past experience in state or federal Government sales of salad oils may be given preference.</p>
<p>12. Manufacturer's proposals shall include their requirements for the nonprofit agency such as quality systems/certifications, inspection of the NPA premises, proprietary information/non-disclosure agreements; defect liability; product recall; etc. Additionally, it is expected that the Non-profit Agencies will be subject to a comprehensive Quality Audit by the selected supplier, to ensure they meet the standards of the Co-Branding Partner. Proposals should outline the requirements of the Quality Audit. Additionally, if there are areas that do not meet the standards of the Co-Branding Partner, it will be the responsibility of the supplier to work with the Non-profit Agency to meet those quality requirements.</p>
<p><br />The deadline for response is December 17, 2010.</p>
<p>Responses should be directed to the contact listed in this Notice. The preferred method of submission is via email to Stephanie Blake. Responses, if submitted via email, should be limited to 10MB or less. There is no limit if submitted to the physical street address.</p>
<p>Questions should be directed to Stephanie Blake at sblake@nish.org or 571-226-4620.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for white papers. This publication constitutes a request for information (RFI) and no formal request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this request will be issued. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) will not issue paper copies of this request. This is not a commitment to fund any effort submitted in response to this request. The Government may consider procurement of materials, equipment, or services as a result of the information provided in response to this request. The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with the development and submission of materials in response to this request.</p>
<p>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) seeks white papers from private industry, academia, and government entities regarding alternative thermal spray technology to replace current coating systems for non-skid applications on U.S. Navy ships. These applications include, for example, aviation decks, weather decks, and interior decks. These alternative thermal spray technologies sought must be capable of providing durability that exceeds current requirements for a Type V, Composition G or L (36 months of service or 15,000 landings) as defined in the version of MIL-PRF-24667 found at https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=107630. To accommodate the next generation of aircraft, the alternative nonskid material needs to also comply with anticipated high heat shipboard operational requirements. A desired thermal spray will need to cycle multiple times from no thermal load (ambient conditions) up to temperatures between 1,200 to 1,700 degrees Fahrenheit for &frac12; to 1 minute followed by 4 minutes with no heat load then re-heated. Based on information provided, the Government may request to perform limited testing at a Government laboratory as a pre-screening to determine if further consideration and evaluation are desired.</p>
<p>Submissions</p>
<p>White papers must be received no later than 1:00 p.m. Eastern on 14 January 2011 and responses received after that time will not be reviewed.

<DESC>Sources Sought for Potential Repair Vendors for an Engine Instrument Display System.<br />This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.

After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the repairs, a solicitation announcement will be published in the CBD. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not adequate response to any future solicitation announcement. All interested offers will have to respond to the solicitation in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. Again, this is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. All companies that can meet the specification are encouraged to provide a capability statement, company literature, brochures, or any other information that demonstrates that the specification can be met. Any questions concerning the technical specifications should be directed to Mr John Turmelle at John.F.Turmelle@uscg.mil and any other questions should be directed to thomas.f.mason@uscg.mil.

This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award. All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from the responses to this announcement.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering (RDEC) Acquisition Center, Natick Contracting Division (NDC), Kansas Street, Natick, MA on behalf of the U. S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, Natick, MA intends to negotiate and award a Contract modification on a sole source basis with Oxyheal Health Group, 3224 Hoover Ave National City, CA.  This work will be to perform four due diligence inspections of Oxyheals hyperbaric chambers at four locations in support of TBI studies.  Where this is a modification to an existing award that totals roughly 1% of the total contract value it is for the inspection of Oxyheal chambers it would be unfeasible to contract these inspections to any other firm.  Any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 5 days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements, yet must be limited to 2 pages.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, NCD will proceed with awarding a firm fixed price modification to Oxyheal Health Group.  Nothing herein should be misconstrued as a request for proposal.  No solicitation document is available.  Any Questions concerning this acquisition may be addressed to the above address, Attention: Mr. Nate Jordan or by email to: Nathan.C.Jordan@us.army.mil.  This synopsis expires November 22, 2010 at 08:00am.

<DESC><p>The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking ideas that may support a potential new DARPA program designed to provide novel approaches to sense and interpret biological signals correlated with human user intent, and to translate these signals into actual waypoints or movement commands in a virtual or physical environment. Relevant biological signals may include, but are not limited to, electromagnetic, galvanic, and behavioral responses.</p>
<p>Potential applications of this technology may include immersive 3D warfighter training or robot operation. Bandwidth must be sufficient to at least indicate waypoints in real time. The error rate must be low enough to overcome potential disruption by noise associated with simultaneous body movements and external electrical interference. In a simulation training environment, for example, it would be advantageous for users to control avatar navigation while concurrently performing manual tasks such as weapons training. Likewise, methods of navigating a robot using biological signals should allow the operator to manually control additional complex robotic tasks. Primary usage is focused on normal, healthy populations as end users, and in these cases, non-invasive methodologies are ideal. Respondents are also welcome to address both invasive and non-invasive approaches geared toward clinical populations such as paraplegics and lower extremity amputees.</p>

<DESC>Special Notice: The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), National Reconditioning Center (NRC) is awarding a Purchase Order for the conversion and repair services of the following equipment: Ring, Elec, Cont (SR) PN: 1213618-201, CAGE: 56232, PN: E2263-00-1, CAGE: 17399, ASN: R400-2A1A2 to Electro-Miniatures Corp. Sole Source Justification: The Government only knows of one source, Electro-Miniatures Corp., who has the facilities, procedures, and expertise to assure the successful and timely repair of the equipment. The Government does not have specifications or any adequately detailed information to solicit a bid from another vendor. Market research is the following: Multiple searches of the Small Business Administration (SBA) Dynamic Small Search failed to identify any additional small business available to compete for this required repair service. Search parameters included a combination of NAICS code &lsquo;811219' and key words: &lsquo;convert, NEXRAD, slip ring assembly, 4-port to 3-port'; and just key words: &lsquo;convert, NEXRAD, slip ring assembly, 4-port to 3-port'; and &lsquo;convert, slip sing assembly, 4-port to 3-port'. A search of "convert NEXRAD slip ring assembly from 4-port to 3-port"; and "convert slip ring assembly from 4-port to 3-port" in GSA's eLibrary retuned zero matches. A sources sought was posted on FedBizOpps on October 30, 2010 for a 10 day posting and no responses were received.

<DESC>RECOVERY PWR ARRA JODA PMIS 146613 For Information Only - Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source Modification to Contract C9325100002, JODA Zero Energy House, John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.
RECOVERY TAS::14 1041::TAS RECOVERY JODA PMIS 146613 The National Park Service intends to negotiate and award a firm fixed price contract modification in the amount of $4,980.19 to Kirby Nagelhout Construction, 20635 Brinson  Blvd, Bend, Oregon 97701 for additional within scope construction work at John Day Fossil Beds, near Mitchell, Oregon. This is not a request for competitive proposals and is published for the purpose of providing public notification.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1. Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity: Department of Interior, National Park Service, North Cascades National Park.
2.Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved: Modification of contract C9325100002 for additional within scope work related to construction of a Zero Energy Residential Structure at John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.
3. A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs, Including the Estimated Value: Modification, additional within scope work at John Day Fossil Beds National Monument; added work includes change windows specified for net decrease in contract price, aluminum rail changes, change appliances specified for additional energy improvements and to update to current models, add fire detection, change roofing specified to obtain better quality and color match, change split air handler specified for net decrease in contract price, change door hardware. Net increase in contract price $4,980.19
4.An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: COTI 1443.6-01, as amended, DIAPR 2008-10 and FAR 6.3
5.A Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: This is an ARRA project that was properly synopsized and awarded as a competitive contract. As a complex project to construct a house that uses zero energy (produces more then it consumes) some details of the project were field changed to improve quality of construction, improve warranty, further reduce and or save energy, and improve livability of the employee occupied structure. The contractor (KNC Construction) was selected under this Best Value RFP due to their technical ranking, past performance record, and competitive price proposal.  
6.A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice Was or Will Be Publicized as Required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, If Not, Which Exception Under FAR 5.202 Applies:  The modification was properly synopsized since this action is funded under ARRA.
7.A Determination by the Contracting Officer That the Anticipated Cost to the Government Will Be Fair and Reasonable: Pricing for the additional work has been reviewed by the Program Manager and the Contracting Officer, documentation is on file.
8.A Description of the Market Research Conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market Research was conducted for the original contract.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY<br />NO SOLICITAION WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THIS SYNOPSIS<br /></span></strong><br />The first purpose of this Modification 45 is to obligate $170,000 in new funding to Option Period 2 and to reallocate ARRA funding between the three work assignments associated with Option Period 2 of this contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance for Work Assignment 2-101 is from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010. Funding for WA 2-101 is $389,000.00.</p>
<p>The period of performance for Work Assignment 2-102 is from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010. Funding for WA 2-102 is $307,000.00.</p>
<p>The period of performance for Work Assignment 2-103 is from January 4, 2010 through December 31, 2010. Funding for WA 2-103 is $1,154,141.17.</p>
<p>Under <strong>WA 2-101</strong>, requires support for technical and administrative tasks to inform and coordinate Regional and Headquarters policy development and decision-making on meeting the BA provisions of ARRA particularly in regard to requests for waivers from the requirements of section 1605. Efforts include:<br />&bull; Collect and log all requests for waivers from the requirements of the Buy American provisions of the ARRA. <br />&bull; Evaluate waiver requests related to the purchase and installation of construction material and equipment for water and wastewater facilities to ensure waivers comply with applicable justifications.<br />&bull; Evaluate construction cost estimates and develop detailed independent construction cost estimates as needed to evaluate waiver requests for the purchase and installation of construction material and equipment for water and wastewater treatment facilities, including estimated costs for iron, steel, and the relevant manufactured goods. Compare project costs using goods manufactured in the US compared to foreign manufactured goods. <br />&bull; Prepare a report on each waiver. <br />&bull; Develop a tracking spreadsheet database documenting each waiver request.</p>
<p>Under <strong>WA 2-102</strong>, the contractor shall provide the technical and logistical assistance to support the EPA in achieving the goal, objectives and requirements of the ARRA provisions as to "Green Infrastructure." Efforts will revolve around the review of DWSRF project proposals received by the individual State for ARRA funding to determine whether those projects have a green component, and make recommendations for green practices that can be incorporated into the projects. The effort will include providing technical assistance to states and applicants in developing and reviewing the "business cases" that are submitted along with projects in support of considering them as green projects.</p>
<p>The primary focus is on the green aspects of drinking water infrastructure projects. The work is intended to supplement and be coordinated with EPA's efforts for the GPR through the CWSRF.</p>
<p>This work assignment will benefit the agency by advancing our goal of encouraging the development and implementation of projects that provide the social, health and environmental benefits to be derived from "environmentally green" projects under ARRA's Green Project Reserve (GPR).</p>
<p>Under <strong>WA 2-103</strong>, the contractor shall provide the expertise and support to assist EPA's effort to assure an effective, legal and appropriate expenditure of ARRA funds to achieve the objectives of the economic stimulus through significant program implementation and oversight. Support tasks include assisting in: tracking the program's implementation; reviewing EPA Regional ARRA implementation efforts; assisting and training EPA Regional Offices in the oversight of State ARRA programs; training and assisting States in implementing their ARRA program including tracking and providing technical assistance to applicants; developing information to assess the successful implementation of the program; and providing reports on achievements to senior EPA and Executive Branch officials, the U.S. Congress, the water industry and other stakeholders and the general public.</p>
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

DEPARTMENT OF LABOR
Employee Benefits Security Administration
29 CFR Part 2590

Request For Information/Request For Industry Comments
Affordable Care Act; Federal External Review Process; Request for Information


This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes for the  Office of Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, Department of Health and Human Services; Employee Benefits Security Administration, Department of Labor. This request for information is also published in the Federal Register, Volume 75, Number 221 on November 17, 2010.

Background:
This notice is a request for information (RFI) to gain market analysis information in advance of one or more future Requests for Proposals (RFP).  On July 23, 2010, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury published interim final regulations regarding, among other things, procedures for external review of health plan denials.  The regulations include a provision for a Federal external review process in instances where there is no applicable State process.  This RFI solicits information that will enable the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Labor (DOL) to conduct a market analysis and assist the Departments in planning and developing the Federal external review process.  HHS and/or DOL may contract for services required to fulfill the statutory and regulatory requirements of the Federal external review process established under section 2719 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations. 

Purpose and Objectives 
Section 1001 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act), Public Law 111-148, added a new section 2719 to the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act).  The Affordable Care Act also added a new section 715(a)(1) to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and section 9815(a)(1) to the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) incorporating the provisions of part A of title XXVII of the PHS Act (including PHS Act section 2719) into ERISA and the Code and making them applicable to group health plans and health insurance coverage in connection with group health plans.  The Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury (the Departments) published interim final regulations implementing the provisions of PHS Act section 2719 on July 23, 2010, at 75 FR 43330.

Section 2719(b)(1) of the PHS Act and the Departments regulations provide that, if a State external review process that applies to and is binding on a health insurance issuer includes, at a minimum, the consumer protections set forth in the Uniform External Review Model Act issued by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC Uniform Model Act), then the issuer is not required to comply with the Federal external review process.  State law may provide similar protection for group health plans that are not subject to ERISA preemption, such as nonfederal governmental plans.  The Departments, through guidance, are authorized to establish an external review process that is similar to a State external review process that meets the standards set forth in the interim final regulations for group health plans and health insurance coverage if a State has not established such a process. 

Questions
This RFI requests comments on operational issues associated with implementation of a Federal external review process for health coverage in States that do not have an applicable external review process that meets the minimum Federal standards.  HHS and DOL plan to ensure consistent and uniform processes for external review by independent review organizations (IROs) within relevant geographic areas and throughout the nation.  The Department of HHS and/or Labor may enter into one or more contractual relationships to implement the external review process and reserve the right to award one contract or several contracts depending on the workload and decisions on how to divide the workload of the Federal external review process, as necessary. 

In particular, HHS and/or DOL may contract for services required to fulfill the statutory and regulatory requirements of the Federal external review process established under section 2719 of the PHS Act and its implementing regulations.  In such a case, the contractor would be responsible for conducting standard and expedited reviews of all adverse benefit determinations and final internal adverse benefit determinations that are eligible for external review as defined by the regulations.  Reviews would be conducted in an accurate, efficient, timely, and consistent manner.  In conjunction with completing these reviews, the contractor may be tasked with the following functions and responsibilities to support the permanent Federal external appeals process:

	Development, maintenance, distribution, and update of decision support protocols;
	Adjudication of external review cases, using established protocols; 
	Timely and accurate disposition of all external review cases; 
	Collection, consolidation, storage, maintenance, and transmission of information regarding the receipt and disposition of external review cases for the Federal external review process;
	Performance of statistical and data analyses of external review cases to include trend analyses, and compliance with HHS data and reporting requirements including ad-hoc analyses for reports and inquiries from HHS, Congress, and other entities, and for purposes of continuous quality improvement; 
	Participation and coordination with other entities (including other IROs) involved in the Federal external review process for quality improvement purposes; 
	Communication of external review decisions to claimants and other parties involved in the case; 
	Case management and documentation, which may include document imaging to produce a complete electronic case file; and
	Training all critical and qualified staff on all aspects of the external review process.

Accordingly, the Departments of HHS and Labor are seeking to engage formally, in a transparent and participatory manner, with the public on best practices and standards currently used by IROs.  Specific questions are set forth below.  Comments are invited from all stakeholders on these issues. 

Qualified Organizations and Staff
(1)	What accreditation standards currently apply to IROs? 
(2)	What credentialing standards do IROs require for medical and legal reviewers?  Is credentialing required or voluntary?
(3)	What procedures are currently used by IROs to assure that reviewers do not have conflicts of interest with disputing parties?
(4)	What are IROs current capacity for performing reviews?  Does staffing and the time necessary for performing a review differ based on the type of claim (e.g., medical necessity, experimental/investigational treatment, coverage issues, etc.)? 

Infrastructure	 
(5)	Please describe the type of data collection systems that IROs currently use to conduct analyses, reporting, and tracking of appeals and grievances.
(6)	Are the current data systems available in a secure, 508-compliant, web-based interactive structure?
(7)	What telecommunication systems and consumer technical support systems do IROs currently maintain for consumers (e.g., websites, 24-hour hotlines, helpdesk, and/or translation services for non-English speakers)? 
(8)	What is a reasonable amount of time for a contractor to become fully operational (have all systems in place to conduct external reviews) after the date of a contract award?  What resources would be necessary?
(9) 	What considerations must be taken into account to smoothly transition from the current Federal interim external review process to a possible new permanent Federal external review process?  
(10)	Do IROs currently operate nationally or in limited geographic areas?  Would IROs that currently serve local areas be able to expand their service areas to possibly include other geographic areas such as other States?  Are there any State and/or local licensing requirements?
(11)	Are there any special considerations HHS and/or DOL should be aware of in considering a specialized contract for urgent care appeals or for experimental and investigational treatments? 
Would such an approach have an impact on coordination?  
(12)	Please describe the difference in standard operating procedures and resources (time, cost, personnel) for appeals that involve only medical necessity and those that involve both medical necessity and coverage questions.  

Data Collection 
(13)	What data are currently collected by IROs for tracking appeals and conducting analyses?
(14)	What steps are taken to ensure confidentiality and security protections of patient information?  

Evaluation 
 (15)	Do IROs (or subcontractors) currently conduct evaluations of their operations?  Do such evaluations include an assessment of how easy it is for consumers to access and use the external review process in a timely manner?  Do evaluations result in quality improvement initiatives?  If so, what are some examples of quality improvement initiatives undertaken by IROs?
(16)	What specific requirements should be applied to IROs to evaluate progress toward performance goals?  What performance goals are the most appropriate?

<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1b. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.)

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>(3) ( ) are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.</p>

<p>(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and</p>
<p>(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>

1.	Background

The Federal Offset Program is a government-wide delinquent debt matching and payment offset system.  It is a means of offsetting Federal payments due the delinquent debtor from the Federal Tax Refund Offset Program and the Administrative Offset Program.  It is a cooperative effort between the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) and Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS).  The Program refers the names of non-custodial parents who are past due in their child support obligations to FMS to offset payments being refunded to delinquent obligors.

One of the functions OCSE performs is the production of a pre-offset notice to be sent to those individuals who have been submitted for potential administrative and/or tax refund offset. This notice, mailed in double window envelopes to the delinquent debtor at the address used to file his/her last year's tax return or the most current address on file at the State and submitted to OCSE, may be sent by either OCSE or the IV-D agency at the State's option.  (Currently 25 States and/or jurisdictions elected to have OCSE send their pre-offset notices.)  These pre-offset notices will be mailed to delinquent debtors and inform the individual of the amount of support claimed to be past due. New cases may be added to the program throughout the year with a corresponding pre-offset notice being issued to the non-custodial parent.  The pre-offset notice informs the individual of the amount of support claimed to be past due, provides a State or local contact address and phone number to whom the obligor may submit any objections regarding the proposed administrative and/or tax refund offset.

2.	Project Objective

The objective of this contract is to perform all steps necessary to complete the timely printing and mailing of all OCSE issued pre-offset notices within one week of receipt. Only new cases require pre-offset notices be mailed to the non-custodial parent. States may also request that additional pre-offset notices be issued to an obligor as needed.  The contract will be structured to provide for a base year and four option periods (five-year contract total) consistent with the current contract structure.

3.	Statement of Work and Detailed Technical Requirements

The contractor must have on site computer capability to use Coding Accuracy Support System (CASS) or a similar system to read and process CD-ROM data provided by OCSE containing the nine-digit Postal Service Information to assist the contractor in sorting the cases for mailing.  The contractor's computer system must be certified by the Postal Service in order to attain a lower postage mailing rate which would result in significant cost savings to both State and Federal governments.  The contractor must be able to include appropriate postal bar codes on each notice.  It is estimated that the number of notices will not exceed 3.5 million but could be as low as 1.5 million per year based on current legislative requirements.  However, should there be future legislative changes, the amount per year may exceed 3.5 million.
 
The contractor will be required to purchase and store envelopes to complete deliveries 1 to 2 months before work starts.  In addition, any leftover envelopes must be stored until the contract period is over at which time the envelopes will be stored at contractor's facility.  It would be the responsibility of the new contractor to transport the unused envelopes to their warehouse immediately after the expiration of the current contract.  Consequently, this could involve moving and storing from 200,000 to 3.5 million envelopes depending on the time of the year.

The steps to be completed:

	file conversion and CASS certifying addresses

	print pre-offset notices

	burst and trim the notices;

	fold, stuff, and seal the notices into the double window envelopes with indicia provided by the Government;

	compare machine counts of notices ready for mail with the counts on the disk supplied by OCSE

	within 5 business days of delivery of file from OCSE, print, insert and deliver the mail to the local mass mailing center and have the postal service complete the appropriate USPS Form;

	keep OCSE informed on a daily basis of status of all processing and mailing orally and/or in writing; and

	reprint damaged notices

	purchase and store envelopes on site from the time of delivery for use throughout the year.

All appropriate Federal regulations regarding the handling and safeguarding of tax information will be strictly observed and enforced (see IRS Publication 1075).

4.  General Requirements and Deliverables:

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, and supplies (except as otherwise, specified herein) and perform the work set forth below.

The contractor must establish written safeguards for the transportation, processing, and storage of the tax information in conformance with section 6103(p)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).  Only authorized employees will be permitted to handle the notices.  All affected employees of the contractor will receive, read, understand, and follow the procedures as delineated in IRS Publication 1075 (Tax Information Security Guidelines).

Printing of the notices will commence on January 25, 2011 (approximately) at the rate of approximately 37,000 per week and mailing will start on a weekly basis beginning on or around January 28, 2011.  The contractor will be required to mail pre-offset notices throughout the year for new and existing cases (the contractor will be provided with the new cases on a weekly basis).  

The pre-offset notice is currently a one page notice with the name and address of the non-custodial parent as the addressee and the State or local Child support office as the return address on the first page.  However, the contractor must be able to print, insert and mail multiple-page notices, as well as different notice formats if required.  Care must be taken when printing, trimming, bursting, folding, sealing and mailing the notice so that the page(s) will align properly, thus reducing the number of damaged pre-offset notices.

The pre-offset notices will be processed in sequence.  The notices will be inspected to ensure that composition and alignment are correct to allow for efficient processing.  Notices will be printed, burst, trimmed, and folded so the appropriate name and address of the noncustodial parent and the return address show through the windows of the double window envelopes and then the notice should be stuffed in the envelope.  The envelope must then be sealed and ready for mailing.  The count of the number of notices put through the mailing machine must be compared with the count of the number of notices printed.  The counts must agree.  If they do not, they must be rectified immediately (differences should be attributed to damaged notices only).

Any notices damaged during processing will be reprinted, inserted and mailed within 2 business days of such damage.  The contractor must constantly observe the processing of the notices and immediately stop the processing when damaged or mutilated notices occur, thus minimizing the number of notices that must be reprinted and processed.  

 The contractor will have USPS Form 3606 (Sender's Statement for Foreign Mail) or USPS Form 3600-R (Statement of Mailing) signed by the post office when verifying the mail.  These forms will be sent to OCSE immediately after the mailing occurs.  These forms will be part of the reconciliation process. 

Prior to award the prospective contractor must be available to conduct a test of all machines which will actually be used to process the pre-offset notices.  At least 1,000 notices, divided equally among all machines to be used, must be included in the test run. The run should include each phase of the process except the actual mailing.  The contractor will also be required to conduct annual tests of at least 1,000 notices if deemed necessary by OCSE.

The contractor must describe exactly how it will fix mechanical or other problems that come up during processing.  This is to include whether or not back-up machines will be used, and if not, whether a subcontractor will be engaged to perform the work.  If this is the case, the subcontractor's name, address, telephone number, and experience with this type of work must be specified. Also, the capacity in terms of the amount of work the subcontractor is capable of handling within a 24 hour period must be described.  All security considerations attendant to the transport to the subcontractor, and the subcontractor's processing and storage of the information must be described in the written security guidelines.  If a repair shop is to be called upon to fix the machines, the name, address, telephone number of the repair shop must be specified.

Also to be specified is the time frame after the problem occurs in which the repair shop will be called and the problem will be fixed.  The contractor is required to carry an appropriate level of Errors and Omissions Insurance Coverage and provide a Certificate of Insurance copy.  OCSE must be immediately notified of any problems that do occur, and be kept continually informed of what actions are being taken to remedy such problems and the progress of these actions.

The contractor must allow OCSE to inspect the work site, as it deems necessary.

(a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

	Quotations will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth below to determine the vendors demonstrated ability to provide the required goods/services.  Quotations must be specific and compliant with all terms and conditions of the solicitation in order to be acceptable.  The vendor shall clearly and completely address the factors as required by the solicitation.  Any quotation failing to address all of the elements of the solicitation factors will be considered an indication of the vendors lack of understanding of, and response to, the Governments requirements and may result negatively in overall quotation evaluation.

Factors are listed in descending order of importance

Security and Storage

The vendors quote shall demonstrate the vendors process for ensuring that the mail distribution adheres the regulations set forth in the IRS Publication 1075 Tax Information Security Guidelines for Federal, State and Local Agencies.  

Technical Approach

The vendors quote shall demonstrate the vendors ability  to handle high volume mail processing.  The contractor shall describe their ability to accurately process mail utilizing Coding Accuracy Support Systems and other business practices to ensure accurate delivery and processing of mail. 

Past Performance

Past Performance of Similar Tasks  Please provide at least 3 but no more than 5 references of similar efforts by your organization for the last three years for performing high volume mailing services for Federal, State or Local governments.  

The Government may also consider information obtained through other sources.  Past Performance information will be utilized to determine the quality of the contractors past performance as it relates to the probability of success of the required effort.

If the vendor does not have any past performance references, then the contractor will be evaluated by neutral.   (References will be checked)

Price 

Contract award shall be made to the responsible vendor whose offer, in conforming to this RFQ, provide the overall best value to the Government, past performance, technical factors, and price considered. A vendors quote may not be considered when the proposed price is unreasonably high or unrealistically low. In the event quotes are evaluated as technically equal in quality, price will become a major consideration in selecting the successful vendor Vendors will also be evaluated for appropriate labor mixes and price reasonableness.

HHS intends to award without discussions; however, HHS reserves the right to hold discussions if required.  Accordingly, each initial quotation should be submitted on the most favorable price and technical terms that the vendor can submit to HHS.  


Technical and past performance, when combined, are more important than price.  

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p><br />The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have &#10063; have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have &#10063;, have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has &#10063; has not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious,or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director (OD). The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance. DRM also develops, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human induced disasters. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response and risk reduction programs. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).</p>
<p>The Technical Assistance Group (TAG) within DRM was created in order to provide OFDA with a skilled cadre of technical experts in a variety of fields relevant to its disaster response and risk reduction activities. It is divided into a number of subgroups that include Food Security, Health, Most Vulnerable Populations, and Natural Hazards groups. The Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Advisor is part of the Technical Assistance Group.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The DRR Advisor is an integral member of the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) TAG Team. USAID/OFDA DRR activities are intended to minimize the adverse impacts of natural hazards by reducing vulnerability to disasters, increasing regional, national and local capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters, and enhancing the resiliency of vulnerable groups and communities to recover from recurrent natural disasters.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Advisor who will work with OFDA technical experts to develop disaster risk reduction strategies for OFDA programming. This will include leading the design of community-based disaster risk reduction strategies, coordinating transition from emergency assistance to development programming, monitoring of DRR activities, and providing representation at international forums.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Disaster Risk Reduction Advisor will be based in Washington, D.C. The duties and responsibilities are:</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as the focal point within USAID/OFDA for Disaster Risk Reduction programs and activities; contribute to the development and communication of appropriate DRR strategies and policies for OFDA and the U.S. Government (USG) in disaster and emergency-response;</p>
<p>&bull; Assess priority countries for DRR interventions; initiate and lead the discussion of needs and demands of these priority countries in the area of disaster risk reduction; provide leadership and technical input for the design, development, and implementation of disaster risk reduction activities at the national and regional levels, including the formulation of national and regional capacity building programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Engage with the technical experts on USAID/OFDA's technical assistance group (TAG) to develop and integrate thematic programs related to risk identification, capacity development, climate risk management, urban risk management and gender within each sector to ensure that DRR programming is technically sound, gender-sensitive, sustainable, and within OFDA's mandate;</p>
<p>&bull; In collaboration with the OFDA Regional Teams and TAG, review DRR proposals for appropriateness for OFDA funding, and identify areas where DRR can build upon ongoing disaster response and/or development programming; assist regional teams and technical leads in assessing gaps and needs;</p>
<p>&bull; Develop increased awareness of disaster risk reduction strategies and activities within USAID/OFDA and other offices and bureaus, including through training;</p>
<p>&bull; Organize and/or substantively contribute to discussions on disaster risk reduction policy initiatives, including lessons learned and evaluations of the experience of various international organizations in disaster risk reduction;</p>
<p>&bull; Represent USAID/OFDA on policy, strategy and technical matters related to DRR in inter-agency, regional and international meetings; present USAID/OFDA position on disaster reduction and recovery issues, and relevant policies, strategies, results and lessons learned in workshops, seminars and conferences;</p>
<p>&bull; Support regional advocacy efforts related to the promotion, adoption and endorsement of disaster risk reduction strategies;</p>
<p>&bull; Facilitate internal advocacy efforts related to mainstreaming disaster reduction into USAID-supported development initiatives;</p>
<p>&bull; Manage the production and dissemination of both regular and occasional reports on USAID/OFDA activities in disaster risk reduction; prepare evidence to support increased investment in DRR through cost-benefit analyses;</p>
<p>&bull; With input from OFDA/Office of the Director, undertake working level negotiations with counterparts in multi and bilateral agencies; coordinate with international donors, NGOs, UN agencies, and other regional, national, and local partners to promote the implementation of DRR activities in disaster-prone regions;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as requested on field assessment missions, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) and Response Management Teams (RMTs);</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as DCHA/OFDA Duty Officer on a rotational basis.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The DRR Advisor will take direction from and report to the Technical Assistance Group (TAG) Team Leader or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The DRR Advisor is expected to act independently with minimal direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment. The TAG Team Leader will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals, objectives and functions.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11. WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Work is primarily performed in an office setting. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.

<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<SUBJECT>Joint Future Theatre Lift (JFTL) Technology Study (JTS) Capability Request for Information (CRFI)
<SOLNBR>XR-20-OCT-10
<RESPDATE>122210
<CONTACT>Anthony L. Fisher, Contracting Officer, Phone 9372557761, Email anthony.fisher@wpafb.af.mil - Pete Kronbergs, Phone 937-904-4499, Email pete.kronbergs@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Requirements and Capabilities Integration Directorate, ASC/XR, Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing a Capability Request for Information (CRFI). THIS IS A CAPABILITY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This CRFI solicits information from Department of Defense (DoD ), other government agencies, US and/or foreign companies who can provide promising technologies and system concepts that can achieve a Joint Future Theater Lift (JFTL) capability. The Government will use the CRFI responses to inform on-going cost and capability analyses and provide an analytical foundation to inform the FY14 Program Objective Memorandum (POM). Small Businesses are encouraged to provide responses to this CRFI in order to assist ASC in determining potential levels of competition available in the industry.
<p>This CRFI initiates a call to investigate the realm of the possible in regards to aircraft concepts and associated technologies which could support Air Mobility Command's (AMC) Joint Future Theater Lift Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) requirement. The Government will consider system concepts having anticipated technology and manufacturing readiness levels (TRL/MRL) of 6 no later than 2019. TRL/MRL applies to fully mission capable aircraft and their associated technologies and integrated logistics support (training, maintenance, supply, support equipment, etc).</p>
<p>JFTL is envisioned as a next generation theater lift capability that enables routine logistics and payload delivery/extraction airlift missions into complex, austere, unimproved/unprepared landing areas. JFTL capabilities will significantly contribute to the following operations within the Range of Military Operations: theater airlift of cargo and passengers, combat employment and sustainment (expanded to include Mounted Vertical Maneuver), aero-medical evacuation, support of special operations, forcible entry, strikes and raids, support of irregular warfare, noncombatant evacuation operations, recovery operations, and homeland defense. JFTL will be required to provide movement, maneuver, and distributed sustainment in an environment where increased capacity, speed, payload, range, agility, access, depth, precision, simultaneity and survivability will be at a premium. JFTL airlift capabilities will need to provide the battle space access, precision of delivery, and responsiveness of action needed for rapid decision. To do this, the JFTL will be capable of (1) moving medium-weight armored vehicles and personnel to strategic, operationally and tactically significant depths and (2) supporting maneuver in close proximity to objectives and sustainment of distributed forces in complex, austere, unimproved/unprepared landing areas to point of need/point of effect. The platform must be able to carry and/or airdrop required cargo loads into and out of complex, austere, unimproved/unprepared landing areas (requiring no additional infrastructure or material handling support equipment) and exploiting these landing areas to achieve runway-independent takeoff and landing operations. JFTL must also be capable of operating in adverse weather conditions and in low to medium threat environments (2024+). <br /><br />More detailed JFTL requirements can be found in the attached detailed JTS CRFI that accompanies this posting.<br />This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). This announcement is not to be construed as a formal solicitation. It does not commit the government to reply to information received, or to later publish a solicitation, or to award a contract based on this information. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. Further, ASC is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Not responding to this CRFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.</p>

Maximum page limit for responses is seventy-five (75) pages and must be indexed with respect to the outline of this CRFI, allowing for information to be easily located. Tables delivered in spreadsheet format will not count towards the page limit. Respondents must limit administrative and company/agency overviews to four (4) pages. <br /><br />Multiple concepts from a single company are permissible. 75-page limit, per concept, applies.</p>
<p>Submit UNCLASSIFIED responses in electronic form only via e-mail or by sending the responses on a single compact disk (700 MB CD compatible with Microsoft Windows) by mail.

<DESC><p>Follow-up Market Research to C-21A RFI</p>
<p>This is a follow on to initial RFI released on 22 September 2010 in order to gather more specific information.</p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, as part of a market research. The Contract Logisitcs Service's Special Duty Branch is seeking to identify sources that may be capable of providing Full Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) to include: Organizational and Depot Level Maintenance, Contractor Operated &amp; Maintained Base Supply (COMBS), Contract Field Team (CFT) Support, and Installation Support for Modifications at 4 CONUS, 1 OCONUS, and 1 deployed location for 28 C-21A aircraft, beginning on or about 4th quarter FY12. The awarded contractor will provide all support equipment, spares, and parts inventory. The Government is seeking industry input on questions provided below. There is no solicitation package available at this time. All interested parties should send company and/or descriptive literature along with responses, questions and/or comments to Mr. Samuel McDuffey, e-mail: samuel.mcduffey@tinker.af.mil. All responses should be received no later than 3:00 PM CST, 1 December 2010. All questions and comments must be in writing, no telephone calls. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this request, nor will the Government compensate any respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.</p>
<p>1) Do you currently provide Organizational and Depot Level maintenance and Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) to customers who operate small business jets? If so, how many locations and number of aircraft do you support and what model of aircraft?</p>
<p>2) Has your company had experience (in the past 5 years) in providing Organizational and Depot Level Maintenance, and COMBS to a fleet of business type jet aircraft in excess of 25 aircraft in multiple locations?</p>
<p>3) What does your company specialize in?</p>
<p>4) We are contemplating awarding a 5 - 7 year contract.<br />a) Can you accurately reflect your costs for this period of performance? <br />b) What are your concerns regarding this period of performance?<br />c) How long is your typical contractual arrangement established with vendors and subcontractors?</p>
<p>5) What advantages/disadvantages do you perceive would be obtained by using a FAR Part 12 contract?</p>
<p>6) What type of contract does the commercial marketplace use for this kind of aircraft maintenance and parts support?</p>
<p>7) What type of contract do you recommend for this acquisition and why?</p>
<p>8) Do you have any experience with Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts?</p>
<p>a) If so, what are your perceived advantages/disadvantages of using an IDIQ contract for this acquisition? <br />b) Do you recommend an IDIQ contract for this acquisition?</p>
<p>9) What are your thoughts on this effort being a total small business set-aside?</p>
<p>10) The Government is contemplating a service contract under NAICS Code 488190<br />a) Do you have any concerns with the use of NAICS Code 488190 for this contract?<br />b) Under NAICS Code 488190, what category does your company fall within; small business, veteran-owned small business, small disadvantaged business, Certified 8A, Hub Zone small business, women-owned small business, large business?</p>
<p>11) What previous experience does your company have with Government contracts?<br />a) Is your company familiar with the Government processes of contracting, billing, engineering, etc.?</p>

<p>13) What do you perceive are the pros and cons of including liquidated damage penalties tied to aircraft availability?<br />a) Would this have any affect on contract price?</p>
<p>14) How do you handle obsolescence management of components for other commercial aircraft?</p>
<p>15) Being as specific as possible what would you see as a justification to award a 7 year period of performance versus a 5 year period of performance contract?</p>
<p>16) From your perspective given the C-21A requirements illustrated within this RFI, what impact would a 5 year contract have on price versus a 7 year contract? Please provide a percentage estimate the government could expect to see in relationship to the difference and explain your rational. <br />a) Do you see other potential impacts from a 5 year to a 7 year contract?</p>
<p>17) What type incentives do you believe would best motivate you to offer continuous improvements to the government?</p>
<p>18) The government is contemplating providing incentive option years on a FAR Part 12 (Commercial) Firm Fixed Price contract. We are considering the award of incentive years to be based on your ability to reduce the overall contract price. <br />a) Do you foresee a methodology and application to apply incentives to a 5 year basic period of performance contract whereas up to 2 additional (incentive) years may be gained?<br />b) If so, please explain your rational in as much detail as as possible.<br />c) What areas should the government consider for award of incentive options to allow the overall reduction of the contract price?<br />d) What known industry practices or innovations do you recommend to generate a price reduction to the overall contract?<br /><br />19) Do you currently support any foreign deployed sites on a continuous basis and if so, in what capacity?<br />a) If not, have you in the last 5 year provided aircraft support at a foreign deployed site? If so, in what capacity?</p>

<p>23) Would your company be interested in participating in this solicitation to award? <br />a) If so, what role are you considering? Prime, sub-contractor or other?<br />b) Would your participation be affected if the awarded period of performance was 5 years rather than 7 years, if so please explain?</p>
<p>24) If you are not a Small Business and plan to participate as a prime on the forthcoming C-21A solicitation, what do you think would be appropriate small business subcontracting goals? (categorize by small business type and percentage of total contract value)</p>
<p>25) Understanding that the contractor will be responsible for the purchase of all parts, inventory and support equipment and that the 28 aircraft will be located at worldwide locations (4 CONUS, 1 OCONUS, and 1 deployed site), please respond in appropriate detail to the following questions:<br />a) What would you recommend as a minimum transition period?<br />b) Using your recommended transition period would it be reasonable of the government to expect 100% contractual performance immediately following the transition?<br />c) If 100% cannot be expected immediately following the transition period you have identified, how long would your organization require before the government should reasonably expect you to obtain 100% contractual performance? What is the significant issue driving the additional time period of expected performance?</p>
<p>26) What recommendations/approaches can you offer that would result in the successful Contractor Logistic Services effort for these aircraft?</p>
<p>27) Do you have any recommendations and/or concerns with this source selection?</p>
<p>28) Provide any other comments/concerns you like.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request. This request for information is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.<BR><BR>**Questions & Responses Added - Updated w/additional Q&As 11/17**<BR><BR>1. SCOPE.<BR>Background: The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to rapidly increase mission capability while reducing risk to Soldiers and others by equipping operational commanders with off-the-shelf (government or commercial) solutions or near-term developmental items that can be researched, developed and acquired quickly. The REF receives requirements from operational commanders in war zones setting forth the capabilities needed. <BR><BR>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain potential solutions to provide mast mounted surveillance cameras. The REF believes that Counter-Insurgency Operations (COIN) in Iraq and Afghanistan will require the use of mast mounted day/night cameras in order to accomplish these efforts. Alternative solutions submitted by companies responding to this RFI will also be considered. <BR><BR>Experience and information obtained from this request for information will be provided to Army Product Manager REF who will evaluate the information and feasibility of issuing a procurement action to resolve the stated problem.<BR><BR>2. REQUIREMENTS. <BR>The REF has a need for a mast mounted day/night camera that will increase situational awareness and surveillance operations. The system will operate during day, night and all weather conditions.<BR><BR>2.1. The system should be able to sling loaded or air deliverable.<BR>2.2. The system must have a night/thermal and day camera attached to a mast.<BR>2.3. The mast must have the ability to be raised and lowered.<BR>2.4. The mast must have the ability to be raised and lowered to height between 20 and 50 feet.<BR>2.5. The camera must have the ability to detect targets at four kilometers. <BR>2.6. The camera must have the ability to identify targets at two kilometers.<BR>2.7. The camera must have an internal laser range finder and be capable of returning an azimuth and direction from a target at the identifying range (2km).<BR>2.8. Must have an installation time of less than 30 minutes.<BR>2.9. The system must have the ability to be powered by attached solar panels, an external generator, or an alternate power source.<BR>2.10. The system will be trailer mounted.<BR>2.11. The system will have the ability to be integrated with other mast mounted camera systems (same salient characteristics) and all systems can be linked to a centralized node.<BR>2.12. Each system will have a minimum of one viewing monitor.<BR>2.13. The system must be significantly robust to operate in a rugged environment.<BR>2.13.1. Operating Temperature Range: -24 Celsius to +50 Celsius.<BR>2.13.2. Must be able to sustain extensive dust, sand, snow and wind.<BR>2.14. The delivery timeline will be NLT 60 days ARO.<BR>2.15. System must be an off-the-shelf (government or commercial) item.<BR><BR>Questions & Responses<BR><BR>Q1. Is the detection computerized as it pans the target area or is it manual<BR>assisted with human interface?<BR>A1. Manually assisted with human interface.<BR><BR>Q2. What does the government mean by 'sling loaded or air deliverable'?<BR>A2. The system must have at least four lifting shackles attached to the trailer<BR>to give it the ability to be sling loaded by helicopter.<BR><BR>Q3. Regarding requirement 2.11, 'and all systems can be linked to a<BR>centralized node;' does the government mean using IP cameras? How far is<BR>the single node from each individual mast?<BR>A3. Yes, the government means using networked cameras. Cannot provide the<BR>distance from the single node to each individual mast.<BR><BR>Q4. What is the target size is for detection at 4km and identify at 2km?<BR>A4. Vehicles and Personnel.<BR><BR>Q5. How many systems are you seeking for delivery of 60n days ARO?<BR>A5. The REF is seeking two systems for delivery of 60 days ARO.<BR><BR>Q6. Is the expectation that cameras will be able to see items placed in a<BR>culvert (i.e. at the opening) or that the cameras will have video analytics<BR>to be able to detect someone placing an item in a culvert?<BR>A6. No.<BR><BR>Q7. How will the output from the laser range finder be used, are there existing<BR>capabilities that will use this information or is it just to provide ground<BR>personnel the location of a target?<BR>Q7. Provide ground personnel the location of a target.<BR><BR>Q8. Does the camera need to be controlled locally at the mast and at a<BR>centralized node?<BR>A8. The camera needs to be only controlled at a centralized node.<BR><BR>Q9. How will the cameras be utilized, ie focused on a fixed area until there is<BR>a need to pan, tilt, zoom?<BR>A9. The cameras will be used to focus on a fixed area until there is a need to<BR>pan, tilt, zoom.<BR><BR>Q10. The RFI references a need for situational awareness, is there situational<BR>awareness required other than video analytics such as a COP with geospatial<BR>overlay?<BR>A10. No.<BR><BR>Q11. Are you looking for any features at the viewer such as motion sensing or<BR>exclusion zones?<BR>Q12. No.<BR><BR><BR>3. DELIVERABLES<BR>Specific information on industry capability to produce a system that can meet the requirements identified in paragraph 2 above, or otherwise solves the problem of identifying and detecting objects being emplaced.<BR><BR>This is NOT a Request for Proposal. Companies who desire to participate in this market survey are encouraged to submit a white paper which supports the companys claim that it presently has the technology, qualifications, and capabilities to satisfy one or more of the performance and technical objectives described above. The white paper should discuss the companys ability to develop and or provide existing technologies to detect items placed in culverts in Iraq and Afghanistan and should provide a ROM (rough order of magnitude) price and its anticipated delivery for the solution proposed.<BR><BR>The white paper should also discuss related company experience and include point(s) of contact. The white paper should be prepared in MS Word, limited to ten (10) pages, and submitted electronically to the contract specialist at thomas.marousek@us.army.mil. The company shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research. All requests for further information must be made in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. The government will review RFI submissions as they are received. The government reserves the right to close this RFI once they have received adequate response(s) to this RFI.

<a href="mailto:kathy.sthill@faa.gov">kathy.sthill@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>Amended on November 17, 2010
This RFI is amended to:1. extend the response date for questions and comments an additional 30-days.2. include 3 additional questions on the List of Specific Questions to Industry
As such, written responses must be provided electronically to Kathy St. Hill at Kathy.StHill@faa.gov no later than 3:00 PM EST on Friday, December 17th, 2010.  Industry should use the attached template when preparing their responses.  All files must be submitted in Microsoft Word format.

================================================================================In the past year, The National Airspace System (NAS) Voice System (NVS) Program Office received a number of Request for Information (RFI) responses from Industry regarding the NVS Reference Architecture, network management, transition, and the application of Working Group 67 (WG67) Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) Air Traffic Management (ATM) open standards. Based on the feedback, we have been developing the NVS Acquisition Strategy and NVS Technical Specification.  The draft NVS Strategic Plan was released to Industry on September 29, 2010 and is available on the FAA Contract Opportunities website at https://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm. It describes the high level FAA strategy for the NVS program and the target operating environment it will support.  
The purpose of this announcement is to solicit the industry comments and approach on meeting some of the NVS functionalities as identified in the attached specification.  The feedback will assist the FAA in refining and validating the functional requirements of the proposed NVS system.
The FAA recognizes that in order for the industry to provide constructive feedback the NVS Technical Specification, the NVS functional block diagram, would be required.  Hence, attached is the draft preliminary NVS Technical Specification.  This specification is a work-in-progress and will be continually updated based on industry and stakeholder input.  Our goal is to develop an NVS specification that is consistent with the draft NVS Strategy Plan and identifies functional requirements for a flexible voice communications infrastructure to enable future NextGen operational improvements and capabilities.
In addition to the feedback on the specific questions posed in this RFI (which are included as a separate attachment) we would also like to obtain comments on the draft preliminary NVS Technical Specification.  The responses to the questions will provide a valuable and measured insight into the understanding and activities of the enterprise voice communication industry and the status of the NVS Technical Specification itself.  Based on the input and feedback, we will continue to update the NVS Technical Specification and share the information with industry as we move forward with the NVS Program.  Industry responses will be used to:
- Assess the current state of commercially available systems- Determine reasonableness of the requirements and whether significant redesign and development would be required- Determine whether the requirements as stated would restrict an offeror's system from providing the FAA with maximum benefit. 
The FAA requests written responses must be provided electronically to Kathy St. Hill at Kathy.StHill@faa.gov no later than 3:00 PM EST on Wednesday, November 17th, 2010.  Industry should use the attached template when preparing their responses.  All files must be submitted in Microsoft Word format.
The FAA will hold one-on-one sessions with interested parties allowing an opportunity for Industry to provide additional input to their responses.   These sessions will be held at a Government designated facility in the Washington, DC area December 13-16, 2010 and will be limited to 3 hours per vendor.   Interested parties must contact Kathy St. Hill at Kathy.StHill@faa.gov or at (202)493-1408 by 3:00 PM EST on Wednesday, November 10th, 2010 to schedule a time.
Attachments included in this announcement are: (1) draft Technical Specification (in PDF and Word format); (2) draft Interface Requirements Document (NVS to Radio Subsystems); (3) Interface Requirements Document (NVS Console Equipment to Console); (4) NVS Draft Spec Comment Form; (5) List of Specific Questions to Industry

The following pertains to this Amendment:


QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q1.  We are planning to hand deliver our proposal.  What is the process for obtaining access to the base?
A1.  Please email jen.mcdonald@navy.mil with the persons name that will be making the delivery, company name, and indication of U.S. Citizenship by 4:00 p.m. Thursday, 18 November 2010.  

Q2.  This pre-solicitation reads as though there is a requirement for a small business subcontracting plan.  We are interested in providing some of these percentage goals for the anticipated larger prime companies going after this solicitation.  Is this something that we would have to be pre-qualified for through the Navy or do we have to contact the actual prime contractors?  
A2.
  The Navy will not be pre-qualifying subcontractors for this solicitation.  You will need to contact the actual prime contractors directly.  Once award is made, we will post the prime contractor information so that small businesses may contact the prime for subcontracting opportunities.

Q3.  When do you estimate the release of the solicitation?
A3.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with Architect and Engineer Slate/Selection procedures.  Interested firms are to submit SF330's as detailed in the posted notice.  There will be no separate solicitation.

<DESC>&nbsp;This is a request for information for planning purposes only.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Feedback from potential sources is needed to
<p>&nbsp;1) determine the availability and capability of all qualified sources,</p>
<p>&nbsp;2) determine if any future procurement should be set aside,</p>
<p>&nbsp;3) determine how to procure this requirement (i.e., Federal Supply Schedule vs. open market), and</p>
<p>&nbsp;4) obtain feedback and questions regarding the draft Statements of Work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Background:</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Social Security Administration desires to proactively identify and pursue new and creative ways to improve agency operations and business processes. SSA is a premier change agent within government, and looks to advance the use of innovative technologies to enhance communications, reduce agency workloads, and expand interactions with a diverse customer base. Major technology breakthroughs can promote greater agency agility, creativity, and flexibility, facilitating mission objectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This proposed future contract will provide research, development, implementation, and support capability for high risk/high reward emerging technologies to sustain agency programmatic and administrative operations for innovation, transparency and open government activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We envision that research will be in the form of customer surveys, interviews, focus groups and other means to obtain the public's view of SSA's systems and access to information and will be a critical part of the process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;No coding or writing programs is anticipated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The focus will be rather recommending innovative solutions, based on research, and designing and improving processes, applications, and interfaces with the public.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We envision that these improvements/innovations will primarily be in the area of Information Technology (IT).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, such recommendations may also encompass non-IT areas, for example, redesigning the layout of a field office to make it more easily accessible to the public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;SSA anticipates either establishing multiple award BPA's under existing federal supply schedules or multiple award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Sources that feel they have the capability to fulfill this potential requirement are requested to complete the brief questionnaire and submit it to the contracting officer by Tuesday, December 7, 2010 at 9:00 am EST.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Interested sources are also encouraged submit capability statements along with the completed questionnaire. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Responses must be submitted to brenda.<a href="mailto:monch@ssa.gov">monch@ssa.gov</a>. Emails are limited to 4MBs in size.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, multiple emails may be submitted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Faxed information will not be considered. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information submitted in reply to this notice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by SSA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government reserves the right to contact, or not contact, any party responding to this notice in order to obtain further information for market research purposes.</p>

<DESC><strong>AMENDED SYNOPSIS (FEDBIZOPPS Notice) - Posted 11 December 2009<br /></strong><br /><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a formal acknowledgement that additional changes are forthcoming to RFP-BARDA-09-35.&nbsp; This RFP remains a Small Business Set-Aside in accordance with FAR 19.5.&nbsp; The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) continue to seek medical countermeasures (MCMs) that will support an effective public health emergency response to smallpox.&nbsp; There will be two significant changes made to the RFP.&nbsp; First, under Section L.5. (Type of Contract and Number of Awards), the United States Government (USG) now contemplates <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one or more awards</span> of a five-year hybrid Firm Fixed Price/Cost Reimbursable type contract for MCMs that can provide treatment for individuals exposed to smallpox.&nbsp; Second, under Section M.1. (Mandatory Criteria for Eligibility), although the Offeror will still need to provide evidence for therapeutic index in non-human primate model under an eventual contract, the USG is willing to forego this mandatory criterion for eligibility at this time.&nbsp; All other mandatory criteria for eligibility will remain unchanged.&nbsp; <br /><br />It remains imperative that an Offeror(s) responding to this amended RFP seek guidance from the FDA prior to submission of&nbsp;a proposal(s) so the proposal may be aligned with current FDA policy, practices, guidance, and current thinking.<br /><br />All amended details and requirements will be described in the forthcoming amendment to the Smallpox Antiviral solicitation, <strong>RFP-BARDA-09-35</strong>.&nbsp; This amendment will be made available electronically through <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a>&nbsp;on or about <strong>28 December 2009</strong>.&nbsp; Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal to be considered by the USG.&nbsp; This amended notice does not commit the USG to the award of a contract(s).&nbsp; Only written or email requests will be accepted directly from the requestor for the solicitation.&nbsp; No collect calls will be accepted.&nbsp; No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.&nbsp; All responses should be identified with the solicitation number <strong>RFP-BARDA-09-35</strong>, name of company, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address of Point of Contact (POC), should be submitted to the Contracting Officer identified in this notice.&nbsp; <br />

<DESC>Source Sought Notice
Private Provider Network

Introduction

This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.

This is strictly market research, therefore no questions regarding this market research will be entertained.

Background

PSC is the shared-services provider for HHS. Created in 1995 to reduce duplication in federal administrative support services, PSC provides support services to the department, its component agencies, and other federal agencies on a competitive fee-for-service basis, allowing the agencies to focus on their core missions. Support services include administrative operations, financial management, human resources, strategic acquisition, and federal occupational health. 

FOH, a division of the Program Support Center and a component of Health and Human Services, works in partnership with Federal organizations throughout the US and its territories to design and deliver comprehensive solutions to meet their occupational safety and health promotion needs.

The Program Support Center (PSC) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) wants to identify viable small businesses that can provide a nationwide network of private providers (PPN) of occupational health medical services for the Federal Occupational Health Service (FOH).  The PPN service requests will include medical surveillance exams, pre-placement physicals, collection of various laboratory specimens, immunizations, annual medical screenings, post-exposure exams, phlebotomy services, and blood pressure checks, in addition to a variety of additional health and wellness procedures and examinations.   More than 16,000 exams and over 80,000 additional OH services were completed by the FOH PPN last year.
 
The PPN will require one centralized location to manage the process of receiving the services requests, assigning the private provider to be used, collecting the results and making the medical record, quality review of the service and results, scheduling of certain exams and shipping of the completed medical record to the designated location.  This centralized location will store all the medical records for the FOH PPN program and will retrieve records and ship to designated location as requested.  The system for communicating and managing the network will be a contractor-provided online secured web-based portal where information on status and results will be available to designated FOH staff.  

The PPN supports FOHs mission and objectives to improve the health and safety of the government workforce. This PPN will enhance the reach of FOH programs offered to its interagency partners by providing FOHs services in remote areas where FOH does not have an Occupational Health Clinic.  The PPN will support FOHs ability to provide high quality occupational health medical services to the Federal government.  

Purpose and Objectives

The purpose of this acquisition is to provide a network of private providers of occupational health medical services nationwide.  Firms are required to have professional and technical expertise in providing a network of occupational health medical services nationwide utilizing a centralized management and quality review process that provides FOH access to a secure on-line website data system. The goal is to provide consistent standardized occupational health services in areas where FOH does not have a current presence in an efficient manner such that Federal employees do not have to travel long distances to receive services, thus saving taxpayer dollars.

The contractor shall provide private provider services within the Continental United States (CONUS), as well as outside of the United States (OCONUS), to include the Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, Hawaii and Alaska, and international locations including Canada. Additional international sites may also be required, if the need for such services may arise. These service provisions are performed through a variety of health and wellness service facilities. Hospitals, occupational health clinics, general medical clinics, specialty and other types of medical providers may be required. Typically around 2000 sites have been used each year, but as many as 5000 might be needed during peak utilization.  Outreach services may be conducted using mobile vans and outreach medical staff. The contractor shall distribute the necessary forms, documents, and supplies to all private providers, as specified by FOH, to successfully perform the required services. The contractor shall receive and process the completed clinical documentation from the private providers and shall review all materials for completeness, adequacy of testing and accuracy according to components and instructions on the work order and/or as specified in FOH Clinical Policies and Procedures. All testing and services should meet United States occupational health industry standards. The contractor will assist FOH in assessing the quality, timeliness and accuracy of services through standard as well as innovative continuous quality improvement techniques.

Place of Contract Performance: Washington, DC

Set-Aside Status: Total Set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)

Description

The mission of VBA, in partnership with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), is to provide benefits and services to Veterans and their families in a responsive, timely, and compassionate manner in recognition of their service to the Nation.

VBA has six lines of business, which deliver services and benefits to Veterans. These are:
o Benefits Assistance Service (BAS)
o Compensation and Pension (C&P)
o Education
o Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E)
o Insurance
o Loan Guaranty

For more information regarding these lines of business and the various benefits and services they provide, please visit http://www.vba.va.gov/VBA/index.asp.

Each line of business has several unique software applications and systems enabling the establishment, development, and payment of over $47 billion annually  in benefits claims. VBA, in conjunction with VA's Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), is in the process of modifying, upgrading, and replacing a number of these applications and systems, and will likely devote significant effort to such activities throughout the period of performance of this contract. While OI&T is responsible for their development, deployment, and maintenance of applications and systems, VBA is responsible for all business requirements gathering, user testing, training, and organizational change management required to implement new software and hardware, as well as any non-IT support services (e.g., business support services) that provide inputs to system implementation efforts. VBA does not develop any applications or systems internally. Any information technology assets or services associated with these VBA projects will be procured by OI&T using separate contract vehicles.

VBA requires on-site project management support and business analysis services for its staff offices, business lines and affiliate VA organizations.

VBA staff offices, business lines and affiliates (hereafter VBA organizations) require these services to support the business activities  surrounding their management of business initiatives and the design, development, implementation, modification, sustainment and portfolio management of their software applications and systems. Multiple VBA organizations have projects and programs  that currently require such services and as these projects and programs are completed, or as new priorities arise, some VBA organizations may require less support while others may require additional support or support for the first time.

Project management support and business analysis services shall be performed on a firm fixed price and/or labor hour basis. To compensate for the fluid nature of this requirement, this contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. VBA organizations will independently procure services via task orders (TOs) against this IDIQ contract. Services will be performed by contractors in labor categories defined in Section 4 of this PWS. TOs will specify the number of contractors in each labor category (and therefore the services) needed by the requiring VBA organization, whether the services shall be performed on a firm fixed price or labor hour basis, any required deliverables and any special conditions associated with performance.

TOs will be aligned with individual VBA organizations and each TO will be managed by a Government Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) who has direct experience in the business requirement on which the TO is focused.

The Contractor shall perform the work in accordance with this RFQ, the resultant contract, and the detailed individual TOs.

The Government intends to make multiple awards as a result of this solicitation. It is anticipated that the awarded contracts (ID/IQ) will have one 12-month base period with four 12-month options. The solicitation will be issued on or about November 30, 2010 with an anticipated close date of on or about May 20, 2010.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301 -2).
<p>Air Force Center for the Environment and Engineering, project number AFCE092878, is funded by the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009. The full amount of the contract falls within the topic area of anaerobic bioreactor. The objective of this contract is to demonstrate and provide the DoD with a renewable energy source to meet the daily needs of DoD installations while limiting environmental impact, reducing demand on stressed energy systems, reducing overall operations and maintenance costs and increasing the reliability of the site specific power systems. This is to be completed in accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT) and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2007 (NDAA).</p>
<p>RATIONALE FOR CONTRACT AWARD THAT IS NOT FIXED PRICE: This is a RDT&amp;E type contract in support of the AFCEE conservation natural resources program, issued against BAA-08-0001. Cost Reimbursement contracts are suitable for use when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit cost to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. The nature of development work often requires a cost-reimbursement arrangement. In addition, the contractor's accounting system has been deemed adequate for determining cost applicable to the contract and appropriate Government surveillance during performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and cost controls are used.</p>

<DESC>The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR), Propulsion and Power Engineering Department, Science and Technology Office (AIR 4.4T) are soliciting proposal abstracts for technologies that will significantly increase the mission performance, operational capabilities, reduce the total ownership cost, and improve system readiness of Naval Air Vehicles. Solicitation Number: N68335-09-R-0204 Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Topics include development of new Prognostics, Diagnostics, and Health Monitoring systems for propulsion, power and drive systems; development of Advanced Aircraft Power Systems, Fuel Technology, and Aircraft Energy Conservation and Environmental Compliance. Detailed information is provided in the NAVAIR publication "Guide to Naval Aircraft Propulsion and Power Technology Development Programs for Fiscal Years 2010 &amp;2011". The aforementioned guide can be accessed via the internet at: www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/; telephone requests will not be honored. Requests for this publication can also be made by mail to: Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Highway 547, Bldg 562-3, Code 2.5.2.3.1, Attn: Judith Dastis, Contract Specialist, Lakehurst, NJ 08733. This notice constitutes a NAVAIR Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) contemplated in FAR 6.102(D)(2)(i). This announcement and any modifications to this announcement will be open through 30 April 2010 in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps). White Papers (WP) and Proposals can be submitted any time during this period. WPs (as described below) need to be coordinated with the appropriate technical area leader and may result in a request for a formal proposal. This is needed to reduce unnecessary proposal preparation work for efforts that may not be of interest to the Navy, or because of the uncertainty of program budgets. Evaluations will be conducted by panel of government experts using the following criteria: (1) understanding the problem, including the ability to plan and implement the program and formulate pertinent objectives; (2) soundness of technical approach, including ability to integrate the proposed technology, adequacy of analysis and degree of technology advancement; (3) allocation of resources, experience and management, including facilities, personnel and (4) past performance in similar efforts, specific areas to be evaluated are quality of product or services, timeliness of performance, and cost control; and (5) and the proposed cost and cost realism. No further criteria will be used in the evaluation. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. Further details on these criteria are contained in the aforementioned Guide. Selection for award will be based on the potential benefit to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of government funds. Cost plus fixed fee, cost sharing, and cost contracts are anticipated. Other types of contracts may be proposed, but offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept. Specific reporting requirements cited on the Contract Data Requirements List (DD1423) shall be specified within each contract award.

<AWARDEE>United Technologies Corp, 400 Main Street, East Hartford, CT 06180 US
<DESC>The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR), Propulsion and Power Engineering Department, Science and Technology Office (AIR 4.4T) are soliciting proposal abstracts for technologies that will significantly increase the mission performance, operational capabilities, reduce the total ownership cost, and improve system readiness of Naval Air Vehicles. Solicitation Number: N68335-09-R-0204 Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). Topics include development of new Prognostics, Diagnostics, and Health Monitoring systems for propulsion, power and drive systems; development of Advanced Aircraft Power Systems, Fuel Technology, and Aircraft Energy Conservation and Environmental Compliance. Detailed information is provided in the NAVAIR publication "Guide to Naval Aircraft Propulsion and Power Technology Development Programs for Fiscal Years 2010 &amp;2011". The aforementioned guide can be accessed via the internet at: www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/; telephone requests will not be honored. Requests for this publication can also be made by mail to: Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Highway 547, Bldg 562-3, Code 2.5.2.3.1, Attn: Judith Dastis, Contract Specialist, Lakehurst, NJ 08733. This notice constitutes a NAVAIR Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) contemplated in FAR 6.102(D)(2)(i). This announcement and any modifications to this announcement will be open through 30 April 2010 in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps). White Papers (WP) and Proposals can be submitted any time during this period. WPs (as described below) need to be coordinated with the appropriate technical area leader and may result in a request for a formal proposal. This is needed to reduce unnecessary proposal preparation work for efforts that may not be of interest to the Navy, or because of the uncertainty of program budgets. Evaluations will be conducted by panel of government experts using the following criteria: (1) understanding the problem, including the ability to plan and implement the program and formulate pertinent objectives; (2) soundness of technical approach, including ability to integrate the proposed technology, adequacy of analysis and degree of technology advancement; (3) allocation of resources, experience and management, including facilities, personnel and (4) past performance in similar efforts, specific areas to be evaluated are quality of product or services, timeliness of performance, and cost control; and (5) and the proposed cost and cost realism. No further criteria will be used in the evaluation. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. Further details on these criteria are contained in the aforementioned Guide. Selection for award will be based on the potential benefit to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of government funds. Cost plus fixed fee, cost sharing, and cost contracts are anticipated. Other types of contracts may be proposed, but offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept. Specific reporting requirements cited on the Contract Data Requirements List (DD1423) shall be specified within each contract award. At a minimum all offerors will be required to submit the following reports: a) Detailed Planning Report; b) Progress Report; c) Financial Reports; d) Test Plans; e) Program Reviews; f) Presentation Material; and g) Final Report. Proposal submission process, format and content, as well as deliverable items are delineated in the above mentioned NAVAIR Guide. Initial proposals or White Papers (WP) should not exceed 30 pages in length, including a cost estimate. BRIEFNESS IS DESIRABLE - WPs RANGING FROM A FEW PAGES TO 15 PAGES ARE THE NORM.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
As required by FAR 6.302-2 - Unusual and Compelling Urgency

1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Medical Center, 5000 W. National Ave. Bldg. 5, Milwaukee, WI  53295

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:  Emergency procurement of thirty (30) B. Braun Outlook 100 Safety Infusion Pumps for the Jesse Brown VAMC, Chicago IL.
		    
3.  	A Description of Supplies/Services required:  The Jesse Brown VAMC has requested the purchase of thirty (30) B. Braun Outlook 100 Safety Infusion Pumps.  The Infusion Pumps are required in order to provide direct patient care for "critical care" patients.  The Outlook 100 Safety Infusion Pumps are no longer manufactured, only remanufactured pumps may be procured.  B. Braun currently offers a one (1) warranty with the purchase of the remanufactured pumps.  The Outlook 100 Safety Infusion Pumps are required to maintain staff familiarity of equipment in order to create as little disturbance to critical care patients.
  
4.	Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 6.302-2(a)(2).  The VA's need for the supply is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless VA is permitted to limit the number of sources. (41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(2)).

5.	Facilities Unique Qualifications:  Unusual and compelling urgency.  Due to an increased patient load the facility has run out of infusion pumps.

6.	Efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable:  The Small Purchase Center and Contract Service Center conducted research and concluded there were no viable GSA contracts for the product. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable:  Price was compared and confirmed with the end user on past purchases for the same or similar type equipment and is comparable.

8.	Market survey conducted:  The Small Purchase Center and Contract Service Center researched GSA and no vendors were found for this product.  Since this is an emergency request, no further market research was conducted.   

9.	Other facts:  None

10.	Other sources expressing an interest:  None

11.	Actions to remove or overcome any barriers to competition:  In the future, the station should identify and research projects, plan ahead and identify special equipment needs before they become an emergency.  

12.	Certification:  I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.

Based upon information received from the station, we concur that it is in the best interest of the government to proceed with the emergency procurement with this firm.
