(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 
(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).
(c) The Competition Advocate (CA) at each contracting activity/office (as defined in DLAD 2.101) shall act as the ombudsman and attempt to resolve contractor complaints.

Complaints which cannot be so resolved shall be forwarded to the HQ through J-72 for resolution by the DLA competition advocate.  Each activity is responsible for developing procedures for executing the duties and responsibilities of its local ombudsman. (d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. (e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. 
18.	UID:  If unit price exceeds $5,000.00 then UID requirements will apply.

In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.  
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.
20.  Buyer name, phone#, and email address   Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to buyer Louis Colon, 405-734-8116, louis.colon@tinker.af.mil.

The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items necessary to provide the requested services. The place of performance is within 10 miles of San Antonio International Airport. The period of performance for this effort is from 6-9 Feb 2014.

This acquisition is issued as a 100% Small Business Set Aside under the primary North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) of 721110 and the related small business size standard of $30 million.  <br> This is not a solicitation for Event Planning Services.

An offer which requires the Government to execute a separate agreement with a third party hotel shall be deemed technically unacceptable). <br> This synopsis is provided for informational purposes and is not to be considered a request for quote/proposal. Solicitation Number W15QKN-14-T-1092 is assigned for reference purposes. The entire solicitation will be made available on or about 14 January 2014 via the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) Acquisition to Business Website located at https://acquisition.army.mil.

This BAA is conducted using full and open competition.  In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA utilizes a two-step process. The first step will be the submission of a concept paper. Offerors that submit concept papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two). Such an invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Instructions for the submission of concept papers and proposals are contained in the BAA. The submission of a concept paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal.  Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA.  Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process.  A proposal's technical evaluation and its importance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award.  Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate.  Concept papers will be accepted continuously through 28 February 2015.  This BAA will remain open continuously through 31 March 2015. The BAA technical areas of interest are divided into the following groups:  A. Combat Feeding Equipment and Systems (objectives focus on combat food service equipment for individual and group feeding, and unit/organization equipment); B.

<p>Examples of items for the QSL could include but are not limited to: Blood Collection sets in various sizes with safety push button technology, sterile, latex free or latex safe and single use.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this effort will be to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL. The QSL for Blood Collection Sets Push Button will be the basis of a separate Standardization Action (SA) resulting in an Incentive Agreement (IA). This initiative will be part of the MSPV program which is executed by the DLA Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in the QSL process vendors must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Medical/Surgical PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. Vendors who previously had an active record in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM). For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support's MSPV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on DAPA for the DLA Troop Support MSPV program. The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, <br />william.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124. Detailed information about the QSL requirements will be provided in the QSL FBO Announcement. The purpose of this Notice of Intent to Establish a Qualified Supplier List is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the QSL FBO is imminent. Upon issuance of the QSL FBO, all relevant information will be available electronically on the FBO website.</p>

<CONTACT>James L. Paxton, Contract Specialist, Phone 9376568142, Email james.paxton@us.af.mil
<DESC>BATTLEFIELD AIRMEN PROGRAM OFFICE<br />ENHANCED NIGHT VISION SYSTEM (ENVS)<br />SOURCES SOUGHT<br />1. The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) Battlefield Airmen Branch (WISN), Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is soliciting information to identify possible sources to provide information on production-ready Enhanced Night Vision Systems (ENVS). This RFI/Sources Sought is issued for informational purposes and market research only and does not constitute a solicitation or commit of the government to award a contract now or in the future. Submitting information in response to this posting is voluntary and participants will not be compensated for preparation costs.
<p>2. The requirement is for a non-developmental (in production) fused night vision goggle.</p>
<p>3. The key system requirements for this Sources Sought are as follows:</p>
<p>a. ENVS must be a non-developmental (in-production) goggle that provides binocular, fused vision. The primary viewing capability will utilize image intensifier tubes (NVIS), with the secondary capability provided by a thermal sensor.</p>
<p>Rationale: Guardian Angel rescue forces, will use the device extensively for search and rescue missions, as well as threat awareness. Thermal also provides vision during periods of little to no moon illumination and provides other operational improvements over NVIS alone.</p>
<p>b. ENVS must mount to ground helmets using the same mounting systems as current Night Vision Goggles (NVGs).</p>
<p>c. Weight: Total ENVS weight should not exceed 32 oz.</p>
<p>d. Power: <br />i. ENVS shall use a battery that is readily available within Department of Defense supply chains or is readily available from commercial sources. <br />ii. ENVS shall be able to utilize power from a body-worn power system.<br />iii. ENVS shall operate without external power (battery pack only) for at least 6 hours.</p>
<p>4. Interested parties can submit a capabilities package, which should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements and describe how the proposed systems can meet or exceed the above mentioned key requirements. Ensure responses are structured and clearly labeled in the same order as outlined in the above mentioned key requirements. Responses should include a picture and part number of a production system.</p>
<p>5. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are an other than small business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business Zone small business (HUBZone). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 334220, size standard 750 employees. All prospective contractors must register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract.</p>
<p>6. This notice is part of government market research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the "art of the possible" and associated material procurement and approach risks from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies and implementation for the ENVS. The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition. If it is determined to be a small business set-aside, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting will apply. Therefore, small businesses that want to be considered for a small business set-aside should demonstrate how they could comply. Potential sources are encouraged to submit recommended small business utilization requirements as a percentage of total contract value for consideration, in the event the acquisition is not set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>7. Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that &lsquo;publicly-releasable' and &lsquo;proprietary' information are clearly distinguished. Any material that is not marked proprietary will be considered publicly-releasable. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>8. When submitting a response, please be aware that the Air Force workforce is supplemented by contracted support personnel. Any proprietary data submitted may be handled by contract support services personnel who have signed the same Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) as organic AF personnel.</p>
<p>9. Responses are limited to 8 pages and should include technical and descriptive text to provide sufficient detail. The submitted documentation becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>10. Broad industry participation for this Sources Sought is encouraged. U.S. and non-U.S. firms are permitted to respond to this ENVS System Sources Sought. Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and posted on Fed Biz Ops (FBO), unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a Company or that Company's response. Post submittal one-on-one information sessions with respondents are not contemplated.</p>
<p>11. This notice may be updated as additional information becomes available. Please check the FBO site for updates to this announcement and register to receive e-mail notices of any updates to the FBO announcement.

HIDAS detects, identifies, prioritizes, and counters threats to the Apache helicopter using multi-spectral threat warning sensors. The HIDAS was developed by BAE Systems (now SELEX) to meet the requirements of the British Army for its Apache Longbows. Subsequently the HIDAS was integrated into the Apache electronic warfare suite/defensive systems of international security assistance partners through the US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. Repair and Return must be able to be performed without requiring any technical assistance or documentation to be provided by the US Government, which does not possess HIDAS logistic, maintenance, or design data. The identity and quantity of failed HIDAS parts requiring servicing are undetermined. The Government does not intend to fund non-recurring engineering that may be required to provide the requested services. <br>  <br> Answering this Market Survey <br>  <br> The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only. This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.

Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense. <br>  <br> At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. The Government may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. <br>  <br> The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from industry, including small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms,  <br>  <br> All responses to this market survey must be received 30 January 2014 at 4:00 PM CST.

A cost comparison will be performed in relation to the expenses incurred at the current location. 

A market survey of the properties offered for lease will be conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs. All interested offerors (owners, brokers, or their legal representatives) must provide written acknowledgement NO LATER THAN Wednesday, January 29, 2014; 4:30pm EST.

<DESC>Analysis of Potential Mitigation SunZia Southwest Transmission Project and White Sands Missile Range (New Mexico)                                                          Supplemental Study Plan			 				        STATEMENT OF WORK
Impact of Proposed SunZia Transmission Line at White Sands Missile Range
The Department of Defense (DoD) commissioned the Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL) to conduct a study to address DoD concerns related to the potential impact on Test and Evaluation (T&E) capabilities of White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) anticipated from one alternative for the proposed installation by SunZia of a high voltage transmission line across Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands north of WSMR.  This supplemental study plan will provide for review of additional route options analyzed by the BLM in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  These options include Subroute 1B3, which generally parallels U.S. Route 380 and an existing overhead transmission line. 
Objective
The objective of this supplemental study is to build on the MIT/LL study by examining specific concerns raised by the DoD with respect to the full host of routing options analyzed by the BLM for the proposed SunZia transmission line, hereafter referred to as the transmission line or the Line and to independently evaluate any associated impacts on the Nations T&E capabilities at WSMR.  The additional analysis will also examine the effectiveness of potential changes to test protocols to allow testing to take place in the presence of the transmission line, and mitigation options addressing any potential impacts from the transmission line on current testing protocols.
Background
WSMR is a DoD T&E resource located in south central New Mexico providing an extensive expanse of instrumented geography that enables test and evaluation, including live-fire, at the over land distances required for networked weapons and sensor technologies.  In 2008, SunZia LLC filed an application for a right-of-way, proposing to route a High Voltage Transmission Line (HVTL) across a portion of public, state, and private land.  A small portion of the ROW crosses the area known as the Northern Extension Area (NEA) used by WSMR. for long-distance testing of sensors and weapons.  
A Memorandum of Understanding was signed in 1973 between DoD and the BLM allowing the Army the right to fire projectiles over the NEA.  The DoD has individual agreements with various private landowners in the NEA.  A Land Use Restriction (LURE) was established with WSMR for state lands within the NEA.  The state was paid for this use.  The military stopped paying for the use in 2006 and there has been no renewal of the LURE since then.  In 2010, the BLMs Socorro Field Office completed a Resource Management Plan (RMP) revision that included management direction for the NEA that designated the majority of the NEA open to rights-of-way, including the areas proposed for routing the transmission line.  
In May 2009, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process was formally initiated to analyze the effects of the SunZia transmission line, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  WSMR became a cooperating agency to the project in August 2009.  The BLM conducted three separate rounds of public scoping in 2009 and 2010, published a Draft EIS in May 2012, and a Final EIS in June 2013.  Several alternatives across the NEA were analyzed in the SunZia EIS process, including BLMs Preferred Alternative Subroute 1A2, which runs along the northern edge of the NEA, and Subroute 1B3, which generally parallels U.S. Route 380 in the southern portion of the NEA.
Scope of Work
This supplemental extends the scope of study previously conducted by MIT/LL with DoD, hereafter referred to as the Study.  The Contractor shall utilize the information obtained for that study wherever possible.  The study will be managed by the BLM, in cooperation with DoD and WSMR.  The DoD and WSMR will have the opportunity to provide the Contractor with additional information relative to this study addendum in the same manner in which date was provided for in the original study.  This study will focus on the marginal impact of siting the SunZia Transmission line along Subroute 1B3.  Analysis of other potential routing options amy be subject of subsequent analysis.  
Task 1:  Review Impact of SunZia Transmission Line on WSMR T&E Capabilities.  
The Contractor shall utilize the information presented in response to Task 1 of the MIT/LL study and obtain further information from DoD and others as necessary to analyze additional route options as contained in the Study.
Task 2. Impact of Existing Infrastructure  on WSMR T&E Capabilities.  
The Contractor shall consider any mitigation measures currently utilized by WSMR to accommodate extant infrastructure - including the existing transmission lines along Route 380,  and how those measures are incorporated into current T&E activities as well as general range requirements and constraints. 
Task 3:  Effect of existing Mitigation to Reduce Impact of the SunZia Transmission Line on WSMR T7E Capabilities.  
The Contractor shall consider whether the impact of the Line along Subroute 1B3 can be adequately alleviated using the mitigation measures currently in place for existing transmission infrastructure along Route 380.  If not, the Contractor shall determine what marginal impact the line along Subroute 1B3 would have in comparison to existing transmission and other infrastructure, and what additional mitigation measures would be necessary as a result of this marginal impact.  
Task 4:  Evaluation of Transmission Line Impact.  The Contractor shall use appropriate analytical models for the participating sensors and range instrumentation to quantify the impacts of existing transmission and other infrastructure on the test scenarios developed in Task 3 of the Study and this supplemental study.  The contractor shall then quantify any marginal impact expected from the line along Subroute 1B3 in comparison to this existing infrastructure baseline. The Contractor shall will create an EMI transmission pattern, and the power spectral density (based upon existing transmission infrastructure) to determine the marginal increase in these metrics posed by the SunZia line.  The Contractor shall then use their expertise to assess the additional impact on sensors and systems under test and range instrumentation posed by the Line compared to existing lines.  
Task 5: Identification and Assessment of Mitigation Options. 
In addition to the modification of test plans described and analyzed in Tasks 2 and 3, the Contractor shall develop a list of potential broad measures currently being used by WSMR to mitigate the impact of extant transmission and other infrastructure on future WSMR T&E activities, and determine what, if any, modifications of these measures would be needed for the proposed transmission line and other analyzed route options. The Contractor shall also provide further mitigation recommendations, depending on the results of its analysis.
Task 6:  Final Report. 
The Contractor shall document its findings and recommendations in a draft report for the BLM to review, and then in a final report with five days after the BLMs review and approval of the first draft final report, which will be in the form of an annotated briefing, available to senior leadership from the Executive Office of the President, Department of the Interior, Department of Defense, and Bureau of Land Management.  This initial draft report and final report will be classified SECRET.  The Contractor shall also develop a condensed UNCLASSIFIED version of the annotated briefing. 
Schedule
The Contractor shall deliver the draft report within 14 days days of receiving Notice to Proceed from the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address:<br />Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Station Support Simplified Acquisitions, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bldg. 31, Room 1B59 Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES
<p>Introduction:<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources, (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses, service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.</p>
<p>Background Information:<br />TriCarb 2910 model must consist of the following standard features and external computer controller and monitor, DVD/RW, built-in EtherNet support Ergonomic computer mounting arm mounts on either left or right side Independent formatting of printout RS-232, and disk storage.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives for the Procurement:<br />The purpose of this request is to replace the liquid scintillation counter (LSC) currently in use in the laboratory. This counter is in constant use for the analysis of radiolabeled tracer in the plasma of experimental animals following intravenous delivery of a (14C) radiolabeled tracer. For these analyses we count 14C with an added 3H-labeled internal standard so NIMH requires the ability to do double label counting. Because much of NIMH work is on mice NIMH can only sample small volumes of plasma and at the end of the clearance curve counts are very low. NIMH needs the ability to do low level counting (high sensitivity) for these samples. NIMH also uses the LSC to analyze 3H labeled protein in samples of solubilized tissues. The power supply on our current LSC was replaced very recently and NIMH were informed that our LSC is at the end of its useful service and that it can no longer be covered by a service contract. The contractor shall provide a new LSC meeting the above-elaborated specifications. The contractor will provide an extended two-year parts and service warranty on the instrument that will include one preventative maintenance session per year.</p>
<p>Capability Statement:<br />Businesses that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this work should submit complete documentation of their capabilities to the Contract Specialist. The capabilities statement must specifically address each project requirement separately. Additionally, the capability statement should include 1) the total number of employees, 2) the professional qualifications of scientists, medical experts and technical personnel as it relates to the above outlined requirements, 3) a description of general and specific facilities and equipment available, including computer equipment and software, 4) an outline of pervious research projects that are similar to the project requirements in which the organization and proposed personnel have participated, and 5) any other information considered relevant to this program. The capability statement must not exceed 15 single sided or 7.5 double sided pages in length and using a 12-point font size minimum.</p>
<p>Interested organizations are required to identify their size standards in accordance with the Small Business Administration. The government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in a response to this notice. However, responses that indicate the information therein is proprietary will be properly safeguarded for Government use only. Capability statements must include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives. Capability statements in response to this market survey that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will be considered non-responsive. When submitting this information, please reference the solicitation notice number.</p>
<p>All capability statements sent in response to this Sources Sought Notice must be submitted electronically (via email) to Jasmine Snoddy, Contract Specialist-Snoddyj@mail.nih.gov in MS Word within 15 calendar days of the date of this announcement. All responses must be received by the specified due date and time in order to be considered.</p>

The NAICS code for this procurement is 238160.  The project is planned to be issued on or about March 2014.  The construction will occur in the fall of 2014 and is expected to take two or three months.  The estimated construction cost is between $100,000 and $500,000.00. <br>  <br> The work of this project involves replacing two sections of the membrane roof and substrate, and placing ballast on predetermined areas of the roof to hold the existing roof in place.  The roof is approximately 58,000 square feet in size, with several penetrations and joints.  The Barnes Building is a ten-story building located on a busy Boston street. The logistics are a consideration for this project.  The repair of the roof is made more complicated due to the building location within the city. Traffic control will be necessary, with the possibility of shutdown of the street.  The building has limited access for large equipment on multiple sides of the building. The building is adjacent with another large high-rise building which is separated by a narrow alley. The building and adjacent parking lots will be occupied during the construction contract.  <br>  <br> Interested firms should submit a capabilities package to include the following:  business classification (i.e. HUBZone, etc.) as well as qualifications and experience in performing the work components stated above.  Firms must submit past demonstrated experience with repairing membrane roofs, working in congested areas and large cities, providing traffic control, working in complex logistical situations, as well as successfully working on high rise buildings with cranes and/or exterior elevator/lift systems.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION OR BID. NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) anticipates soliciting and awarding a 5 year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) NTE $5M for pallid sturgeon population assessment monitoring actions, pallid sturgeon hatchery propagation and pallid sturgeon focused research investigations in the Missouri River below Fort Peck Dam in Montana.  The Missouri River Recovery Program (MRRP) is required to monitor, propagate and conduct focused investigations in the Missouri River on pallid sturgeon to meet jeopardy avoidance requirements under the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's 2003 Amended Biological Opinion.  The work will require:  a hatchery that has a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service permit for raising endangered pallid sturgeon in a permitted hatchery, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife endangered species handling and collection permit for monitoring and focused investigations related to the endangered pallid sturgeon, and other equipment necessary to demonstrate the capability to effectively complete required monitoring, focused investigation and propagation activities for the MRRP.  <br> The proposed work will include, but is not limited to: <br> a. Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment:  Biological surveys for pallid sturgeon and other native fish species and habitat data collection will be conducted in accordance with the most current guiding documents for Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment.  The contractor will be responsible for data entry and basic analysis of the data for all segments identified in the guiding documents for Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment (most recent version is Welker and Drobish 2012), Missouri River Standard Operating Procedures for Fish Sampling and Data Collection (most recent version is Welker and Drobish 2012).  An annual report that summarizes each year's data collection effort is required. <br>  <br> b. Pallid Sturgeon Propagation:  The USACE has the responsibility to work cooperatively with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to capture, hold and spawn broodstock annually.  The USACE is responsible for a portion of the annual stocking identified as the average annual shortfall in the 2000 Biological Opinion and 2003 Amendment.  The contractor will be required to provide support for activities associated with annual stocking goals for pallid sturgeon.   <br>  <br>  Activities associated with pallid sturgeon propagation include:  broodstock collection, sexing, transport; egg staging and spawning; cryopreservation of genetic material; egg incubation and shipment; culture of fry and fingerling; maintaining captive broodstock; tagging; and stocking.  An annual summary report that is in accordance with a standardized format will be submitted highlighting the propagation activities.  <br>  <br> c. Scientific Studies:  To support learning and progress towards jeopardy avoidance of the pallid sturgeon, certain research activities are required to improve understanding, identify relationships, and resolve uncertainty (knowledge gaps).  Priority information needs are continually being assessed.  Data collection and research study design and analysis may be conducted to address high priority information needs for pallid sturgeon.  These needs are identified under four categories (Early Life Stages, Habitat, Reproduction, and Population Assessment).  The contractor may be responsible for performing a variety of these efforts. <br>  <br> To perform these tasks, contractors must possess or have the ability to obtain and submit one copy of each of the required biological collectors permits:  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Section 10 Endangered Species Permit (for federally listed pallid sturgeon) and Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks Wildlife Collectors Permit (for fishes and turtles, including state and federal listed species).  <br>  <br> The USACE - Omaha District is seeking qualified Small Business (SB) Community Members [Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Section 8(a), Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Women Owned Small Business (WOSB), HUBZone Small Business, Small Business (SB) led teams, Small Business Partnerships and or Small Business Joint Ventures] and Other Than Small Business (OTSB) concerns that qualify under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services.

This notice is provided as information to the market place and is an invitation for an expression of interest and brief demonstration of qualifications to perform and deliver the anticipated requirement.  The Government will not pay for the provision of any information, nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information.  <br> If it is determined that no qualified sources other than the State of Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks respond to this announcement under NAICS Code 541990, our intent is to proceed with processing a sole source award to the State of Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks under NAICS Code 924120.   <br> Contracting Office Address:  USACE - Omaha District, 1616 Capital Ave, Omaha, NE 68102-4901  <br> Point of Contact(s):  Tracey S.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION OR BID.  NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) anticipates soliciting and awarding a 5 year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) NTE $9M for pallid sturgeon population assessment monitoring actions, pallid sturgeon hatchery propagation and pallid sturgeon focused research investigations in the Missouri River below Gavins Point Dam in Nebraska.  The Missouri River Recovery Program (MRRP) is required to monitor and conduct focused investigations in the Missouri River on pallid sturgeon to meet jeopardy avoidance requirements under the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service's 2003 Amended Biological Opinion.  The work will require:  a hatchery that has a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service permit for raising endangered pallid sturgeon in a permitted hatchery, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife endangered species handling and collection permit for monitoring and focused investigations related to the endangered pallid sturgeon, and other equipment necessary to demonstrate the capability to effectively complete required monitoring, focused investigation and propagation activities for the MRRP.  <br>  <br> The proposed work will include, but is not limited to: <br> a. Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment:  Biological surveys for pallid sturgeon and other native fish species and habitat data collection will be conducted in accordance with the most current guiding documents for Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment.  An annual report that summarizes each year's data collection effort is required. <br> b. Pallid Sturgeon Propagation:  The USACE has the responsibility to work cooperatively with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to capture, hold and spawn broodstock annually.  The USACE is responsible for a portion of the annual stocking identified as the average annual shortfall in the 2000 Biological Opinion and 2003 Amendment.  The contractor will be required to provide support for activities associated with annual stocking goals for pallid sturgeon.   <br> Activities associated with pallid sturgeon propagation include:  broodstock collection, sexing, transport; egg staging and spawning; cryopreservation of genetic material; egg incubation and shipment; culture of fry and fingerling; maintaining captive broodstock; tagging; and stocking.  An annual summary report that is in accordance with a standardized format will be submitted highlighting the propagation activities.  <br> c. Pallid Sturgeon and Associated Fish Communities Habitat Monitoring Database:  The contractor will be responsible for database management and basic analysis of the data for all segments identified in the guiding documents for Pallid Sturgeon Population Assessment (most recent version is Welker and Drobish 2012), Missouri River Standard Operating Procedures for Fish Sampling and Data Collection (most recent version is Welker and Drobish 2012), and Pallid Sturgeon Habitat Assessment and Monitoring (most recent version is Sampson and Drobish 2012).   <br> d. Aquatic Habitat Assessment and Monitoring:  For the benefit of pallid sturgeon, the USACE, through management actions or site-level projects, creates and then monitors aquatic habitat in the channelized segment of the Missouri River.  The contractor will be responsible for assessing improvements/changes in the physical habitat characteristics associated with the channelized river, and the biological response to those habitat changes.  <br> e. Scientific Studies:  To support learning and progress towards jeopardy avoidance of the pallid sturgeon, certain research activities are required to improve understanding, identify relationships, and resolve uncertainty (knowledge gaps).  Priority information needs are continually being assessed.  Data collection and research study design and analysis may be conducted to address high priority information needs for pallid sturgeon.  These needs are identified under four categories (Early Life Stages, Habitat, Reproduction, and Population Assessment). The contractor may be responsible for performing a variety of these efforts. <br>  <br> Required Permits:  To perform these tasks, contractors must possess or have the ability to obtain and submit one copy of each of the required biological collectors permits: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Section 10 Endangered Species Permit (for federally listed pallid sturgeon); Missouri Department of Conservation Wildlife Collectors Permit (for fishes and turtles, including state and federal listed species) and Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks Scientific, Education, or Exhibition Wildlife Permit (for fishes and turtles, including state and federal listed species).  <br>  <br> The USACE - Omaha District is seeking qualified Small Business (SB) Community Members [Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), Section 8(a), Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Women Owned Small Business (WOSB), HUBZone Small Business, Small Business (SB) led teams, Small Business Partnerships and or Small Business Joint Ventures] and Other Than Small Business (OTSB) concerns that qualify under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541990 - All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services.

<a href="mailto:brunson.e.grothus@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Rock Island</a>
<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers-Rock Island District is seeking Small Business Concerns capable of providing marine rock placement on the Mississippi River backwater area to create environmental habitat. The work consists of but is not limited to: furnishing all plant, labor material, and equipment necessary for constructing a rock closure structure, bank line protection, tree clearing, and mechanical dredging. Only river access is available. <br>  <br> The rock closure structure would be constructed in Garner Chute and would require approximately 5,000 TN of riprap. Approximately 1 acre of trees would need to be cleared and removed from site at the closure structure tie in. Most rock placement would be in water.  The lowest elevation for rock to be placed is at approximately elevation 513 ft MSL (flat pool is 528 ft MSL). A top width of 10 feet (at up to a top height of approximately 528 ft MSL) with specified upstream and downstream slopes will be required. Excavation of existing material to tie in the structure will be required.   <br>  <br> The island protection will consist of a specified depth of bedding stone (500 TN) and riprap (1,000 TN) and will be placed on the upstream end of a small island in Huron Chute (similar to the Huron Island bank line protection).   <br>  <br> Mechanical Dredging will be required entering the lower end of Huron Island and extending into two small Goose Lake Pools. Tree removal in the proposed placement sites (approximately 25 acres) will be required. The dredge cuts have specified bottom depths and side slopes. Approximately 160,000 cubic yards of material will need to be mechanically dredged/excavated and side cast into designated areas. The pool has significant woody debris and mature trees overhanging portions of the proposed excavation sites. Borings throughout the proposed dredge areas showed similar types of materials, below ground surface, a combination of soft lean clays (CL) and soft silts (MH) showing gradual change into firm fat clay (CH) with increased depth. Underlying this clay layer down to bottom of the hole is clayey sand approximately 4-9 feet down from ground elevation. For borings performed in channels the soft fat clay strata is thinner, as clayey sand was found as shallow as 4 feet below ground surface. Clays throughout the site consistently classify as fat clay with liquid limits ranging between 82 and 61, and plastic limits between 29 and 15. <br>  <br> No clearing of trees greater than 4 inches in diameter with loose peeling bark shall be allowed between April 1 and September 30 (During the Indiana Bat Breeding and Rearing Season).   <br>  <br> Coordination with the USFWS and IA DNR prior to any tree cutting may be required. <br>  <br> Coordination with the IA DNR personnel is required prior to working during the seasonal waterfowl and deer hunting seasons. During peak hunting weekends or dates, all construction activities may be required to cease for a short period of time.   <br> Copperbelly and diamondback water snakes emerge from hibernation in early spring (April) when temperatures reach 64 to 72 degrees F. USFWS and IA DNR personnel shall survey areas under construction for snake activity during this period as a precaution to keep these snakes from being destroyed while they are still lethargic. Construction activities within these areas of suitable snake habitat shall be restricted if such activities are identified. Heavy equipment shall be restricted from this habitat and normally be lifted within 7 to 10 days when the snakes are active enough to escape the disturbance. <br>  <br> No clearing of trees where roosting or occupied nests exist shall be allowed when bald eagles or red-shouldered hawks are present in the area. Although there are known nest sites on Huron Island, currently, none are known to exist within 660 feet of the selected measures. If any nesting activity is observed, no construction activities within 660 feet of the nest shall be allowed.   <br>  <br> The entire project site is within the Mississippi River and is therefore highly susceptible to water fluctuations that may impact work progress. No physical work at the project site shall be required 1 December through 15 March. Standby cost will not be paid.   <br>  <br> This project will have a base bid with approximately 6,000 TN of riprap, approximately 500 TN of bedding stone, and approximately 27 AC of tree removal, and about 160,000 CY of mechanical dredging and side casting. This construction project has an estimated range of $1 to $5 million. The construction of this project is anticipated to take multiple years depending on the options awarded. The North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) Code is 237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction with a corresponding size standard of $33,500,000. <br>  <br> All interested Small Business Concerns are encouraged to respond to this Sources Sought Notice. Contractors are reminded that THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS NOT AN INVITATION FOR BID OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential Small Business Concerns prior to determining the method of acquisition. Responses to this Sources Sought Notice shall not constitute responses to the solicitation, which is not currently available. This Sources Sought Notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response. Upon review of industry response to this Sources Sought Notice, the Government will determine whether a set-aside acquisition is in the Government's best interest. <br>  <br> Please email the following documentation to the Point of Contact listed below. <br>  <br> 1.) Relevant experience in performing efforts of similar size and scope to that of the project description above within the last five (5) years. <br>  <br> 2.) A list of equipment (plant type, size, etc) the contractor is proposing to use. <br>  <br> Email responses with the information required above must be sent to Brunson.E.Grothus@usace.army.mil no later than 5:00 PM Central Standard Time on 23 January 2014. If you have any questions or comments regarding this notice, please contact Mr. Brunson Grothus at (309)794-5241 or by email at Brunson.E.Grothus@usace.army.mil <br>

Interested parties sought for Upper Guadalupe River Flood Risk Management Project, Reach 12 project located at the Upper Guadalupe River, CA. Project will be solicited as an Invitation For Bids (IFB) contract to include clearing and grubbing, care and temporary diversion of water, planting riparian vegetation, and furnishing and installation of in-stream structures.</p>
<p>All responses will be analyzed in order to determine the appropriate strategy for a potential future acquisition. Particularly, the purpose of this NOTICE is to gain knowledge of potential small business sources including certified HUBZone small business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned small business, Veteran-Owned small business, Certified 8(a) small business, Women-Owned small business, etc. Other than Small Business may respond to this notice in the event the market does not indicate significant Small Business interest.</p>
<p><br />Project Description:</p>
<p>The Upper Guadalupe River Flood Risk Management Project, Reach 12, consists of channel modifications to improve the river geomorphology, construction of woody instream structures, construction of maintenance access roads, and removal of non-native/invasive plant species. The project also includes installation of an irrigation system and planting riparian vegetation to mitigate for losses of shaded riverine aquatic (SRA) cover in the other reaches of the river.</p>
<p>Reach 12 extends from Branham Lane Bridge at its downstream end to Blossom Hill Road Bridge as its upstream end. The reach is 5,500 feet long and passes under the State Highway 85 overpasses. The river in this reach was re-aligned in the late 1930's when it was used as gravel quarry. The vegetation was substantially altered at that time. The SCVWD operates three (3) ponds adjacent to, but separated from the river, which are used for recharging the groundwater through percolation. There were gravel spreader dams constructed to divert the river flow to the percolation ponds - but these have already been removed. The reach is relatively straight except for a bend near the midpoint of the reach.</p>
<p>Reach 12 is intended primarily as mitigation for work occurring along other reaches (downstream) of the Upper Guadalupe River Flood Risk Management Project. Reach 12 will provide mitigation for loss of riparian forest and SRA cover in other reaches, as well as loss of urban forest in other reaches.</p>
<p>The project design considers the constraints imposed by the Reach 12 site, which include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Percolation ponds adjacent to the river<br />&bull; Existing soil characteristics (both for planting and engineering design)<br />&bull; Very limited sediment supply due to existing upstream reservoirs<br />&bull; A proposed continuous maintenance road along the west bank and portions of east bank<br />&bull; Limited right of way at some locations<br />&bull; Existing vegetation - both that needs to be removed and those that need to remain<br />&bull; Unsuitable soil with above average concentrations of mercury</p>
<p>A Maintenance Period of three to four (4) years after construction will be part of the contractor's obligation to ensure the vegetation is established.</p>
<p>The work includes, but is not limited to; clearing and grubbing, care and temporary diversion of water, earthwork including excavation and fill for channel work, construction of slope protection, construction of maintenance access road and access ramps, planting riparian vegetation, construction of irrigation system, construction of a raised berm, furnishing and installation of in-stream structures, removal of invasive and non-native vegetation, construction of chain-link fencing and maintenance of planting.</p>
<p><br />Capabilities and Qualifications:</p>
<p>1. Clearing and grubbing</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a qualified biologist to survey the construction area for eggs or young migratory birds just prior to construction or any site disturbance such as clearing or spraying.</p>
<p>2. Care and temporary diversion of water</p>
<p>Prior to dewatering, all native fish and other native vertebrates that may be affected by instream activities shall be removed from the work site by a qualified fisheries biologist provided by the Contractor and placed upstream or downstream as appropriate. Qualifications for the fishery biologist include: expertise in the areas of resident or anadromous salmonid biology and ecology; expertise in handling, collecting, and relocating salmonid species; certification by the American Fisheries Society as a Certified Fisheries Professional; possession of a valid Scientific Collection Permit issued by California Department of Fish and Wildlife; and possession of an (Endangered Species Act) ESA Section 10 Permit issued by the NOAA Fisheries for takes of ESA listed species.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall retain a fisheries biologist with expertise in the areas of resident or anadromous salmonid biology and ecology, fish/habitat relationships, and biological monitoring; and, handling, collecting, and relocating salmonid species. The biologist will monitor activities prior to and during in-channel activities especially during temporary blockage or redirection of the flow of water through the use of cofferdams or culverts.</p>
<p>3. Planting riparian vegetation</p>
<p>The Contractor shall hold a California State Landscape Contractor's License and have a minimum of 5 years revegetation construction experience. The Contractor shall submit three references for similar work completed within the last 5 years.</p>
<p>4. Furnishing and installation of in-stream structures</p>
<p>Provide a list of personnel working on the project including name, title, and statements of their current positions and previous experiences. Selected personnel shall have been involved in bioengineering design and construction efforts similar to the proposed work site within the last 2 years.</p>
<p>5. Intent: To construct in-channel structures.<br /><br />A principal objective of installing engineered structures in the channel is to create conditions more representative of natural conditions. The wood debris structures proposed for the project were designed to emulate in-stream natural wood debris accumulations that occur in unmanaged streams of the Central California Coast, taking into account the site constraints and constraints of working in an urban area. Because of this, contractors should keep in mind that while the completed in-stream structures should be extremely stable and secure, they should have a somewhat chaotic appearance resembling natural conditions, not the "clean, orderly" look of traditional engineered structures.</p>

(11) Quality assurance staff shall include personnel familiar with operating room procedures, infection control practices, aseptic techniques and sterilization methods.  Verification documentation shall be provided with proposal.

B. Component Parts: Components are listed as DO NOT SUBSTITUTE due to the requirements of the specific medical center staff and are required due to the specific instruments currently being used in the operating room or other circumstances.  The substitution or changing of these specific items would require the changing of instruments or equipment in order to utilize the substitute of an alternative item.

(1) Should an equal product be substituted in lieu of that specified, the product line must specify which item is equal and substituted for which item and be approved by the medical center prior to substitution.  If no substitution of an equal product is offered, it will be presumed the offeror will provide the pack as specified.

The Contracting Officer must be notified immediately by telephone (with written notice to follow within five (5) calendar days) if affected by a product recall.  If the recalled component is unavailable for further production of the custom pack(s), no substitutions will be made by the Contractor without written authorization of the Contracting Officer.

C. Unavailability of Component Parts:  Should a component part become unavailable which will temporarily or permanently delay the production of the pack(s), the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and the Contracting Officer by telephone (with written notice to follow within five (5) calendar days) of the situation and the anticipated length of delay.  No deletions or substitutions will be made without written authorization from the Contracting Officer.  If it is necessary and authorization is obtained to substitute a component, the substitution must be of the same or greater quality and will be at no additional cost to the Government.  If the component will be out of stock for a prolonged period of time and the using service chooses to have the pack assembled without the product, written authorization must be given by the Contracting Officer.  The cost of the pack must be adjusted to reflect the change.

D. Packaging:  Unless otherwise specified in the specification, the product shall be packed in substantial containers of the type, size and kind commonly used within the industry for this purpose.

<DESC>The NRC intends to enter into a sole-source purchase order&nbsp;with West Publishing Corporation for 35 licenses to West LegalEdcenter, an online continuing legal education (CLE) subscription service, for a one-year base period with four (4) one-year option periods.
<p>The NRC requires online continuing legal education (CLE) programs for agency attorneys. Most NRC attorneys practice at the NRC Headquarters in the National Capital Region but are licensed in the various several states. As a condition of employment, NRC attorneys are required to maintain an active license in a state, district, or territory. Depending on their individual state bar requirements, attorneys are generally required to complete a specific number of CLE courses or hours in order to maintain their active status. At the same time, federal agencies are being required to reduce their training expenditures. The NRC therefore intends to procure online CLE training, to enable NRC attorneys to accomplish their CLE requirements at dates and times that are the most beneficial for the agency while eliminating the travel and other costs associated with traditional classroom training.</p>
<p>To satisfy this requirement, the NRC intends to procure 35 user licenses to West LegalEdCenter. West LegalEdCenter is a CLE library of more than 7,000 programs and 17,000 hours of CLE, covering every area of practice, most of which is offered in an on-demand format and can be accessed 24 hours per day, 7 days a week from any electronic device with an internet connection. The anticipated period of performance for this contract will be one year, from February 1, 2014 through January 31, 2015, with four additional one-year option periods. <br /><br />West LegalEdCenter is the only online CLE subscription service that meets all of the NRC's needs. While most NRC attorneys practice at the NRC's Headquarters campus in Rockville, Maryland, most are not Maryland attorneys, but are instead members of the state bars of the various states. This fact, unique to federal agencies, requires compatibility with state bar requirements in all of the US states and territories. The NRC needs the CLE training to be offered online and available at dates and times that do not conflict with the responsibilities of the agency attorneys to accomplish the agency mission. The NRC also needs a wide range of CLE training courses to meet the diversity of specialized legal areas of agency attorneys.</p>
<p>West LegalEdCenter offers most of its content in an on-demand format that can be accessed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week from any electronic device with an internet connection. It also offers the most current and comprehensive library of CLE available anywhere, meeting the needs of all of the NRC's attorneys with more than 7,000 programs and 20,000 hours of CLE credit from over 50 content providers, including over 150 live programs or "webinars" each month. No other source of online CLE course provides the diversity of courses, utilizing an extensive array of leading local, state, and national bar associations, necessary to meet the needs of all of the NRC's attorneys in both content and in satisfying the CLE requirements of all of their individual state bar associations. West LegalEdCenter also enables the NRC attorneys to electronically track their individual CLE credits and access their Certificates of Completion.</p>
<p>In addition to offering a comprehensive list of content providers needed by NRC attorneys, such as the American Bar Association, Energy and Mineral Law Foundation, and Federal Publication Seminars, West LegalEdCenter is the only source of courses from many CLE providers such as the American Judicature Society, Andrews Publications, Clarion Legal, Federal Publications Seminars, Georgetown University Law Center, International Bar Association, Legal Talk Network, Practice Development Counsel, Duke University Law School and Boston Bar Association. There are many CLE courses that NRC attorneys cannot get through any other source, such as from the International Bar Association, which is the world's leading organization of international legal practitioners and bar association.</p>
<p>West LegalEdCenter also provides several other benefits or enhancements unavailable from any other source, such as its award-winning CLE podcasts (Legal Talk Network) covering a wide range of topics and practice areas, and its series of interactive "Beyond the Bar" workshops, which offer intensive, yet practical programs. West LegalEdcenter, through an exclusive arrangement with its sister company "Westlaw," is the only web-based CLE service that links to documents on Westlaw that are cited in program materials and allows for more in-depth legal research. The NRC currently has access to Westlaw, a premier online legal research service that provides proprietary access to more than 40,000 database services. With Westlaw access, the status of case law and statutory documents cited in West LegalEdcenter can be easily verified using the KeyCite citation research service.</p>
<p>No other online CLE provider can meet all of the needs of the NRC's attorneys, and no other source has such a comprehensive offering for continuing professional development that will enhance the ability of the Office of the General Counsel to carry out the agency's mission and meet the CLE requirements of the several individual state bar associations.</p>
<p>The authority for this action is FAR 13.106-1(2)(b), only one source reasonably available.</p>

OPEN NOTICE TO THE VENDOR COMMUNITY OF A PROPOSED AMENDMENT
Due to recent clarification from GSA that SIN 132 100 Ancillary Supplies and/or Services is not required for contractors to utilize the FAR 51 Deviation (see Attachment 8) for purchase of ODCs off of GSA Schedules by the contractor on behalf of the Government, NNSA anticipates removing SIN 132 100 list of SINs for this BPA.
An amendment formalizing this and potentially other items is forthcoming, once the Government has completed compiling and answering the questions and comments submitted during the comment period which ended January 9, 2014.

<DESC>This announcement is a notice of intent to issue a sole source contract under the requirements of FAR Part 15 and FAR 6.302-1," Other Than Full and Open Competition - one responsible source".&nbsp;
<p>The National Institutes of Standards and Technology, Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the International Trade Administration, plans to award a bridge contract on a sole source basis. <br /> <br />The contract period shall be from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. Awarding a contract to another source would result in unacceptable delays/gaps in service during the time required to issue a new competitive contract. It is the Government's intent to compete and award a new contract within the twelve (12) month period of performance. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541511 with the Size Standard of $25.5 million.<br /><br />The International Trade Administration (ITA) proposes to contract with Aplicor to support the Client Tracking System (CTS).  The purpose of this system is to provide ITA with a central common database and tools for managing all interactions with its clients.  This software package has several modules that support different applications. The CTS product is developed and licensed (including all supporting modules and components) by Aplicor. Aplicor holds proprietary rights to the Aplicor CTS product and is the exclusive support services provider for the product.<br /><br />This contract will be awarded as new short-term "bridge" contract with the incumbent contractor, Aplicor 1515 South Federal Highway - Suite 306, Boca Raton, Florida 33432 USA. There will be no change to the existing specifications or service requirements.<br /><br />The proposed bridge contract will be for a maximum period of 12 months (including options). This will provide for continuation of current services while the follow-on requirement is solicited and awarded on a competitive basis. <br /><br />THIS NOTICE IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION. THIS NOTICE IS NOT CONSIDERED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE AND TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED.<br /><br />ANY RESPONSE TO THIS NOTICE MUST SHOW CLEAR, COMPELLING, AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT COMPETITION WILL BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE GOVERNMENT. IF NO AFFIRMATIVE WRITTEN RESPONSE IS RECEIVED, THE CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE. A DETERMINATION NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED CONTRACT UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.</p>

<DESC>Effective February 1, 2014, the EPA's Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) will begin using Compusearch's FedConnect as the communications web portal for all solicitations and contracts above the micropurchase threshold, unless an exception applies. Therefore all potential offerors must be registered in FedConnect in order to submit proposals in response to future OAM procurements.
<p>FedConnect is a web portal that connects agencies and vendors to streamline the process of doing business with the federal government. It also provides an open channel of communication with the government that is both secure and auditable. Through FedConnect contractors will be able to receive, review and respond to contract administration actions and documents such as correspondence, request for proposals, tasking instruments  and contract modifications. The use of FedConnect also furthers the EPA's commitment to moving towards a paperless acquisition environment by reducing its carbon footprint and conducting its business in an ecologically friendly manner.  There is no charge to use FedConnect.</p>
<p>Vendors can register with FedConnect at www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/. Please note that FedConnect is used by multiple federal agencies and therefore FedConnect assistance will be provided by Compusearch Software Systems, not the EPA. More information about registration requirements can be found by downloading the FedConnect Ready, Set, Go! Guide at www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/PublicPages/FedConnect_Ready_Set_Go.pdf .  For assistance in registering or for other FedConnect technical questions please call the FedConnect Help Desk at (800) 899-6665 or email at support@fedconnect.net.</p>
<p>In addition, all vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), as this facilitates registration for FedConnect.   Please note that vendors MUST have their SAM profile set to "public," otherwise FedConnect will not be able to access the SAM information required to validate vendor credentials.  Registration may be completed and information regarding the registration process may be obtained at http://www.sam.gov . There is no charge for registration in SAM.</p>

<DESC>Cockpit Avionics Integration Program Request For Information
<p>Synopsis:<br />Request for Information (RFI): Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB) Cockpit Upgrade</p>
<p>1.0 - SUMMARY:<br />1.1 - The Government has a requirement for the sustainment, modernization and enhancement of the A/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB) avionics cockpit.</p>
<p>1.2 - To fulfill this requirement, the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), is investigating alternative acquisition approaches, identifying the feasibility and practicality of each in order to select the most favorable course of action. One alternative under consideration is a hardware and software, "total avionics cockpit", solution. To that end, the Government is seeking interested industry organizations that can furnish the personnel, facilities, equipment and materiel necessary to develop an integrated avionics system cockpit for the A/MH-6 platform with the potential for follow-on avionics systems life-cycle sustainment and support thru 2030. Additionally, as a follow-up to receipt of RFI responses, a Market Research Interchange Meeting (MRIM) may be held for this requirement, tentatively scheduled for 12/03/13. The Industry Day date to be finalized and location will be released on/about 11/04/13.</p>
<p>1.3 - THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued, however it is highly recommended that you respond to the RFI if your company has the capabilities the Government is seeking. If an RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps). It is the responsibility of the potential sources to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 - BACKGROUND:<br />2.1 - Since the baseline A/MH-6M began fielding in November 2003, the MELB Program Management Office (PMO) has conducted a series of modification (preplanned and unplanned) programs to keep the aircraft updated with customer requirements and modernized mission equipment. The preplanned Block 3.0 configuration is the continuation of a block upgrade strategy designed to extend the service life of the A/MH-6M while long-term alternatives for aircraft replacement are analyzed. Part of the Block 3.0 program includes a digital cockpit upgrade for a digital moving map (DigMap), battle field networking, and interfaces for rapid insertion planned technology upgrades.<br />2.2 - Weight discipline is a critical element of this program. The end state of the Block 3.0 modification is successful implementation of the identified level of engineering, performance, and cognizance without increasing the basic empty weight of the aircraft.</p>
<p>3.0 - DESCRIPTION OF NEED: Objectives for the MELB Block 3.0 Cockpit Avionics Integration Program and vendor capabilities/qualifications include:</p>
<p>3.1 - Cockpit Avionics Functionality: The following provides a high-level list of the required MELB Block 3.0 system avionics capabilities:<br />3.1.1 - Avionics System Management/Data Load/Maintenance <br />3.1.2 - Aircraft Systems State Display<br />3.1.3 - Navigation <br />3.1.4 - Flight Management <br />3.1.5 - Communications Management <br />3.1.5.1 - Two-channel data-capable radio in conjunction with existing communications equipment (see Section 3.3 - Hardware below).<br />3.1.6 - Weapons Management <br />3.1.7 - Mission Sensor Management <br />3.1.8 - Tactical Situation Management</p>
<p>3.2 - Avionics Systems Integration:<br />3.2.1 - Interested parties should consider solutions that provide existing and desired capabilities including the functionality stated above and that follow the guidance below regarding hardware components with Size, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C) considerations.<br />3.2.2 - Interface. Any proposed integrated avionics cockpit will be required to interface with a multitude of onboard systems and have the ability to easily integrate new aircraft systems. Integration of cockpit avionics into the aircraft will be performed by a third party vendor. Coordination with this third party will be necessary for full platform integration considerations such as installation, weight, power, cooling, data, and data interface requirements.<br />3.2.3 - A current and notional console layout is available upon request (Reference paragraph 3.7).<br />3.3 - Hardware:<br />3.3.1 - Overall considerations for hardware includes:<br />3.3.1.1 - Cube. Space is extremely limited in the A/MH-6 series of aircraft for cockpit displays, cabin Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), and wire runs. In general, available space for avionics includes areas behind and beneath the consoles, area directly forward of the center console, under the pilot/copilot floorboards, and avionics racks behind the pilot seats (Diagrams with approximate dimensions are available upon request (Reference paragraph 3.7).)<br />3.3.1.2 - Weight. As previously mentioned, weight is a critical element of this program. The weight of the cockpit trade space is estimated to be 120 pounds. (additional information regarding candidate core avionics components for removal/replacement is available upon request (Reference paragraph 3.7).) This weight value is only an estimate to be used for preliminary planning. <br />3.3.1.3 - Power. The A/MH-6 cockpit must operate on 28VDC power. The aircraft does not contain an AC generator. Additionally, aircraft start must be performed on battery power. As a result, critical aircraft state information must be displayed during the start sequence.<br />3.3.1.4 - Environment. The A/MH-6 cockpit will be exposed to harsh environmental conditions such as sand, dirt, debris, and moisture due to frequent open cockpit operations.<br />3.3.1.5 - Night Operation. The A/MH-6 cockpit must be compatible with Night Vision Goggle (NVG) operations.<br />3.3.1.6 - The avionics system equipment will be of the manufacturer's current design (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Level 7 or higher desired), military and/or civil qualified, and capable of performing its intended function in accordance with the operation and performance requirements specified herein. <br />3.3.2 - Upon request, a list of some of the avionics LRUs planned to be retained as a part of the aircraft configuration may be provided (reference paragraph 3.7). These LRUs, including Identification, Friend or Foe (IFF), radios, Tactical Airborne Navigation (TACAN), Air Data Computer (ADC), and Radar Altimeter, must integrate with any proposed cockpit design.<br />3.3.3 - Mission-specific equipment and functionality, such as Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), may also be integrated into this platform as a part of the cockpit avionics integration effort. The Government's primary intent for this RFI is the investigation of candidate cockpit solutions with a focus on reduction in weight attributed to core equipment.</p>

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/RV), in collaboration with the Space and Missile Systems Center, Military Satellite Communications Directorate (SMC/MC), and NASA Glenn Research Center, plan to conduct fundamental research to increase knowledge and understanding of atmospheric effects on radio frequency signal propagation. Specifically, the objective is to statistically characterize channel propagation effects in the V (71 - 76 GHz) and W (81 - 86 GHz) frequency bandwidths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Channel propagation effects can include, for example, signal attenuation, phase dispersion, and depolarization. It is necessary to correlate the long-term channel behavior to atmospheric and meteorological parameters. Measured data will be used to develop and validate modeling and design tools that can be used to design and assess future military satellite communication architectures.

<p>c. Subcontractor Consent: Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor's consent. Provide with the proposal a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor.</p>

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>a. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i. Price<br />ii. Past Performance</p>
<p>Paragraphs b and c are not applicable as shown below:</p>
<p>b. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, and representations and certifications, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All offerors will be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. This award will result in a Firm-fixed price purchase order and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>a. Price Evaluation. Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantity by the contractor's proposed unit price to confirm the extended amount for each contract line item (CLIN). The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>b. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances of efforts involving manufacturing of blankets, comforters, sweatshirts, sweatpants or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receives a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.</p>
<p>c. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>d. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 (shown above) and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>e. A relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, subcontractors and/or teaming partners will be made. In determining relevance for individual contract, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. Relevance will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy determination for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevance. The following relevancy definitions are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved much of the same or similar manufacturing of blankets, comforters, sweatshirts, sweatpants or running suits, similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved some of the same or similar manufacturing of blankets, comforters, sweatpants, sweatshirts or running suits, similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/Past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>f. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>g. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>i. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be <br />contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the <br />Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and <br />Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

In addition, explain corrective actions taken in the past, if any, for substandard performance and any current performance problems such as cost overruns, extended performance periods, numerous warranty calls, etc.</p>
<p>b. Past Performance Information: The government will evaluate the quality and extent of an offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. The government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal government offices and commercial sources, to assess performance. Provide a list of no more than five (5) references of the most relevant contracts performed for commercial customers, Federal agencies, or other military organizations that have used, or are currently using the same or similar service proposed for this contract.

<p>If a teaming arrangement is contemplated, identify the work the subcontractor will be performing if you are relying on the subcontractor's past performance.</p>
<p>c. Subcontractor Consent: Past performance information pertaining to a subcontractor cannot be disclosed to the prime offeror without the subcontractor's consent. Provide with the proposal a letter from all subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement, consenting to the release of their past performance information to the prime contractor.</p>
<p>The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Contracts older than three years will not be considered. Furnish the following information for each reference:</p>
<p>(i) Company/Division name<br />(ii) Services provided<br />(iii) Contracting Agency/Customer<br />(iv) Contract Number<br />(v) Contract Dollar Value<br />(vi) Period of Performance<br />(vii) Verified up-to-date name, address, email address, FAX and telephone number(s) for each company Point of Contact.<br />(viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions<br />(ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</p>

<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)</p>
<p>a. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factor shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i. Price<br />ii. Past Performance</p>
<p>Paragraphs b and c are not applicable as shown below:</p>
<p>b. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>c. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost or price considerations. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, and representations and certifications, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All offerors will be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. This award will result in a Firm-fixed price purchase order and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>a. Price Evaluation. Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantity by the contractor's proposed unit price to confirm the extended amount for each contract line item (CLIN). The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.</p>
<p>b. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances of efforts involving manufacturing of blankets, comforters, sweatshirts, sweatpants or similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receives a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.</p>
<p>c. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>d. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 (shown above) and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>e. A relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, subcontractors and/or teaming partners will be made. In determining relevance for individual contract, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. Relevance will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy determination for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevance. The following relevancy definitions are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved much of the same or similar manufacturing of blankets, comforters, sweatshirts, sweatpants or running suits, similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved some of the same or similar manufacturing of blankets, comforters, sweatpants, sweatshirts or running suits, similar in type as defined in the specifications with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/Past performance effort did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>f. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>g. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.</p>
<p>i. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>

The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, the interested party may contact the Center/MAJCOM/DRU or AFISRA ombudsmen,</p>

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>As referenced in FAR, http://www.acquisition.gov/far/Reference <BR> <BR>(Full Text ? Please see Attachment A) <BR> <BR>(Full Text ? Please see Attachment A) <BR> <BR>As referenced in http://cfr.regstoday.com/48cfr1352.aspx <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.

See 64 FR 16,651 (April 6, 1999).

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions from prospective offerors and to update the requirement to provide the Government the Certificates of Authenticity / Compliance / Conformance and Traceability for Electronic Components as shown below.
<p>All other aspects of the previous solicitation remain unchanged.</p>
<p>1. Question: I understand that the award will be issued on 3/31/14, but wondered if there was a specific date you will need the parts on your dock?</p>
<p>Answer: For clarification purposes, the ANTICIPATED award date is 3/31/2014.</p>
<p>The required delivery date for this procurement, with the exception of the parts listed below, is No Later Than 6 months after receipt of order. Early delivery is acceptable and encouraged.</p>
<p>The below parts are obsolete/hard to find and probably will have to be manufactured. Thus, they require more lead time and delivery may exceed 6 months if necessary. <br />- 5962-8751403XA or 5962-8852506XA<br />- 5962-9081201MGA<br />- 5962-9067801MYA<br />- 5962-8959826MUA<br />- MG80C286-10/883 <br />- 5962-9215601MXA<br />- 5962-9215601MYA</p>
<p>2. Question: Does this mean that all parts have to have a manufacturer C of C or Testing Documents...not just the ones over $20 each?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, offerors are required to provide the Government the Certificates of Authenticity / Compliance / Conformance and Traceability for all items that are awarded to them.</p>
<p>3. Question: Paragraph 3.3 states "any parts with defects/failures during the first year after delivery shall be returned". "The contractors shall be required to pay back the Government the cost the government paid for the items". Could the Navy add a statement the gives the contractor the option of replacing the defective part with a new part? Since the contactor may not know if the part is defective before it use or it may fail following the standard 30 day warranty, would be reasonable to allow the contractor to replace the part under warranty at no cost to the government. Furthermore, in order to consider any warranty expense since the standard warranty on electronic parts (typically 30 days), a failed part provides a greater risk and cost without an added condition for replacement.</p>
<p>Answer: Offeror may replace a defective part with a new part as long as that new part has the the Certificates of Authenticity / Compliance / Conformance and Traceability issued by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or by the Certified / Qualified Independent Testing Facilities that parts have been tested, x-ray, etc. to adequately assure parts are brand new, original and meet their specifications.</p>
<p>4. Question: Paragraph 3.4 It states the contractors are required to make on-time delivery. Late delivery shall not be accepted. Late items shall be removed from the contract and the lack of performance shall be considered by the government for future procurements. We didn't notice any delivery specified in the synopsis or SOW. Is the Navy expecting to see a delivery date quoted for each line item on the returned spreadsheet of prices and would those become the actual contract delivery dates?</p>
<p>Answer: Required delivery date timelines are answered in question #1. A delivery date shall be quoted for each line item on the spreadsheet of prices. Delivery dates shall be quoted in months or days since the award date is unknown at this time. The delivery dates quoted on your spreadsheet shall become your actual contract delivery dates once the contractor has signed the contract.</p>

Question:  Regarding Selection Criteria - Subsection a. Professional Qualifications. The Civil Engineer position requires to be a registered Professional Engineer (PE) in Italy? Also, we have a number of registered PE in Italy (i.e. they can stamp and sign design documents), that are Environmental Engineers. In past and current work in Italy, these PEs have already stamped and signed design projects using their PE registrations. Would that be considered adequate instead of the Civil Engineer since the SOW does not call for civil infrastructure work (i.e. buildings)?  <br>  <br> Answer:  According to the announcement, Paragraph 4, subparagraph a., there is no mention of any registered Professional Engineer (PE) requirement for any of the engineers. <br>  <br> 2.  Question:  Regarding Selection Criteria - Subsection b. Specialized Experience and Technical Competence. The RFP calls for the five projects to be completed within the last five years. Does a project that is over 85% technically complete qualify and therefore could be used? <br>  <br> Answer:  No, projects must be 100% complete to meet these selection criteria. <br>  <br> 3.  Question:  Regarding Selection Criteria - Subsection e. Capacity. Large Task order definition is as up to $1 million in A-E fees. Would projects higher than $1M in A-E fees qualify and therefore could be used? <br>  <br> Answer:  Yes.  Offerors are referred back to the requirements in section 4 subsection e,  quote mark The evaluation will consider the availability of an adequate number of personnel in key disciplines to complete the task orders within normal schedules.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 0800 Pacific Time on 24 JANUARY&nbsp;2014.</p>

<DESC> <br>   The purpose of this amendment is as follows: <br> 1. Vehicle Integration Trade Study (VTS) as referred in RFI on page 3-4 will not be released. <br> 2. The two FAST documents and GRA as referenced in RFI will be released upon request. <br> ***To receive requirement details and RFI attachment please email Michael Levy; Michael.w.levy7.civ@mail.mil or Swati Jain Jain.Swati.civ@mail.mil*** <br> 3. Closing date is now changed from 01/24/2014 to 01/26/2014. <br> 4. Following is the clarification/modification to the RFI based on the technical questions received.  <br>  <br> A Distributed SATCOM Terminal (DST) using the RMPM-1000 in a Brigade Network <br> typically utilizes 40MHz BW.  However, the 40MHz can be non-contiguous and <br> spread over a 125 MHz WGS transponder.  It is typical to have between 3 to 6 <br> segments. The information about the widths and center frequencies of the <br> bandwidth segments are provisionable.  However, transmission bursts are <br> randomly placed in the allocated bandwidth as needed.   <br>  <br> As an objective, the DST will also be required to support networks spread <br> over multiple transponders (125 MHz x n) and future spread waveforms <br> utilizing up to 1 GHz BW.  <br>  <br> In RFI submittal, the contractor shall address the following:  <br>  <br> - Solution shall support the ability of the antenna to track while using a <br> bursty waveform (i.e. not relying on communications signal to track on). <br> This shall be accomplished for a variety of satellites with a variety of <br> beacon locations. <br>  <br> - Antenna solution shall support the bands/polarizations required and <br> support 500 MHz of instantaneous BW (threshold) and 1 GHz of instantaneous <br> BW (objective). <br>  <br> - Instantaneous BW requirements for communications signals within the band <br> are 125 MHz (threshold) and 1 GHz (objective).  The solution shall support <br> operation with anti-jam frequency hopping modems and other types of bursty <br> spread modems operating over non-contiguous bandwidth.  The solution <br> architecture shall identify a roadmap to achieve the objective within SWAP-C <br> requirements.  <br>  <br> - Digitization of the communications signal shall not limit the dynamic <br> range of the modem.  Dynamic range for the RMPM 1000 is  greater than  40 dB on transmit <br> and  greater than 57 dB on receive.  <br>  <br> - In the RFI Appendix A states in section 9.1.1 that  quote mark The likely bandwidth <br> of DST terminals is less than 10MHz. quote mark   This should be removed, as the <br> antenna to core terminal signal interface will certainly require more than <br> 10MHz based on the above discussion. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) / SOURCES SOUGHT (SS) NOTICE     <br>        <br>    Solicitation Number: W15P7T-13-R-A424     <br>    Topic Number: S0810  <br>    Title: Development of Distributed/Embedded Standard SATCOM on-The-Move Terminal   Architecture (DESSTA)  <br>    Division:  SATCOM/Space Systems   <br>    Technical POC: Jeffrey Hoppe   <br>        <br>  ***To receive requirement details and RFI attachment please email Michael Levy; Michael.w.levy7.civ@mail.mil***  <br>    <br>   REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) / SOURCES SOUGHT (SS) NOTICE  <br>  Distributed Embedded SATCOM On The Move (SOTM) Standard Terminal Architecture (DESSTA) Distributed SOTM Terminal (DST) and Open Systems Architecture (OSA) Development Program   <br>    <br>  20 December 2013  <br>    <br>  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A SOLICITATION.   <br>  This RFI is solely for information and planning purposes and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services.

To prove out the interface and architecture, a several demonstration units will be developed.  This Request For Information is a call to industry to provide your input on how to develop the open standard architecture, and demonstration units.  The development of both these items will need to take into account the Army's goals for performance, integration and cost.  <br>    <br>  1.1 ORGANIZATION  <br>    <br>  1.1.1. IDENTIFICATION.  <br>    <br>  US Army, Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Command (CERDEC), Space & Terrestrial Communications Directorate (S&TCD), Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), MD.  <br>    <br>  1.1.2. MISSION.    <br>    <br>  The Space & Terrestrial Communications Directorate's (S&TCD) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Developmental Systems Branch provides the science and technology (S&T) solutions to the S&TCD SATCOM Systems division and the warfighter. In this role the office works on various technology efforts to provide on the move (OTM) satellite communications. S&TCD performs research, development, and engineering functions in all aspects of terrestrial, avionics, and space-dependent communications technology to include adaptive, reliable seamless battlefield communications with full electronic counter-countermeasures capability and information security (INFOSEC).  By harnessing the potential of communications systems technology, S&TCD is able to meet near-term needs of our warfighters.  <br>    <br>  1.2. BACKGROUND.    <br>    <br>  Current SATCOM On The Move (SOTM) terminal products that meet the performance specifications of the Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T) program, cannot be integrated onto heavy tactical vehicles due to many longstanding integration issues.  As a result, our soldiers are without a SOTM capability on the Bradley, and other heavy vehicles.  <br>    <br>  Under the Distributed Embedded SATCOM On The Move (SOTM) Standard Terminal Architecture (DESSTA) Development Program, CERDEC's SATCOM Developmental Systems (DS) Branch is currently researching  quote mark Distributed SATCOM On-the-Move (SOTM) Terminals quote mark (DST) or DESSTA DST.   Distributed terminals are designed from the perspective that several smaller terminal components distributed around the vehicle will add a level of flexibility to the integration trade space.  CERDEC S&TCD and PM WIN-T foresee that distributed terminals will be an enabling technology to overcome these long standing integration challenges.    <br>    <br>  As a standout example, many turreted vehicles cannot mount SATCOM antennas on the vehicle surface because the firing lines or mechanical rotation of the turret will hit the large SOTM antenna.  The antennas of a distributed terminal can be broken up into several smaller antennas that can to be mounted on the side of the vehicle.  By distributing the antennas around the perimeter of the vehicle, this longstanding integration problem is solved.  <br>    <br>  Two major challenges of a distributed terminal are per unit cost, and developing technology solutions that effectively utilize the new integration paradigm they provide.    <br>    <br>  The concept of a distributed terminal requires, what used to be a single system, to be broken up into several individual subsystems or components.  The sum total cost of these components will be greater than that of a traditional single system SOTM terminal simply because some functions will need to be repeated in each component.    <br>    <br>  One way to reduce the per unit cost at the component level is to promote competition for each component.   This can be done by creating a standard architecture for the distributed terminal, then defining open standard interfaces between each component.  <br>    <br>  While distributed terminals will address several longstanding integration problems, there are several new integration challenges that this paradigm creates.  For example, distributed antennas, have additional mounting locations on a tactical vehicle that must be identified.  Additionally, cable routing for distributed terminals is a more complex process, because there are more cables to route.   <br>    <br>  Developing a realistic technology solution that strikes the right balance between:   <br>         -meeting the realistic performance and cost expectations/requirements of the soldier (PM WIN-T requirements),  <br>         -solving the longstanding integration challenges,   <br>         -and managing the new integration challenges that distributed systems create,  <br>  will develop our capability to understand and manage this new trade space as future Programs of Record adopt the distributed terminal paradigm.  <br>    <br>    <br>  In FY13 CERDEC initiated a four year formal research and development program to address the development and standardization of distributed terminals.  The program is entitled, Distributed Embedded SOTM Standard Terminal Architecture (DESSTA).     <br>    <br>  In FY13 the primary efforts of the DESSTA program were to conduct a Vehicle Integration Trade Study (VTS), and to begin development of an open standard architecture for distributed terminals.    <br>    <br>  The VTS integrates a candidate (but theoretical) distributed terminal onto the Bradley M2A3 platform.  In doing so, the VTS identified a number of new integration challenges on the platform that a distributed system may encounter.  The study also addressed how to overcome some of the longstanding challenges of terminal integration onto heavy vehicles.  In the study, the distributed terminal was a viable integration solution for the Bradley M2A3 from a theoretical perspective.  However, the study also points out many other integration questions that cannot be readily evaluated with the information we currently have on distributed terminals.  To answer these questions, development of an actual product is necessary.  The VTS is an available reference, upon request to RFI POCs.  <br>    <br>  In the final three years of the program, FY14, FY15and FY16, the DESSTA program will:    <br>         -Fully develop the OSA  <br>         -Develop DST systems to:  <br>         -Validate and test the OSA,   <br>         -Validate and test the VTS results, further answer integration questions that require a product.  <br>         -better understand and manage the distributed terminal solution space  <br>     <br>  2.0 OBJECTIVE.    <br>    <br>  The objectives of this effort are to:  <br>          -Develop a DESSTA OSA  <br>          -Validate the DESSTA OSA by test with an actual/realistic DESSTA DST systems.  <br>          -Validate the VTS results and further answer integration questions, by integrating an actual DESSTA DST onto a Bradley M2A3 and demonstrating performance.  <br>         -Better understand and manage the distributed terminal solution space, by developing, testing and demonstrating an actual DESSTA DST system.  <br>  The objective of the DESSTA OSA is to foster open market competition for the components of a DST.  These components need to be compatble, interoperable, and interchangeable.  In order to achieve this, there has to be a uniform set of agreed content and context exchanged between those components (i.e. data, control/ status/monitoring, etc).    <br>    <br>  Another key objective for the development is to enable vendors to creatively design and own their own proprietary solutions within the components.  To do this, the OSA needs to be developed in an open way.  This will ensure that the OSA does not preclude the use of varying technology solutions that different vendors utilize.  <br>    <br>  CERDEC recommends a multi-vendor teaming relationship for the development of the DESSTA OSA, as well as the use of an independent consortium to reduce risk of a vendor specific solution.  <br>    <br>  One major challenge with the development of an OSA is that it must be validated.  Products developed properly to the DESSTA OSA will be compatible, interchangeable and interoperable.  As a result, hardware products are a necessary component to test and validate the OSA.  To test if products are interchangeable, several products must be built.  <br>    <br>  CERDEC recommends a multi-vendor teaming relationship between a Core Terminal developer, developing a single core terminal system (quantity two), and two (2) antenna developers, developing two (2) different DST antenna systems.  Two separately developed antenna products which are interchangeable with a common core terminal would prove that interchangeable products can be developed with the DESSTA OSA. These multi-vendor teaming arrangements will herein be referred to as the 'offeror'.  <br>    <br>  2.1 SCOPE.  <br>    <br>  The work defined herein furthers development efforts enumerated under BAA-W15P7T-R-13-A424, Topic S0810.     <br>    <br>  The period of performance should be no greater than 29 months.  The effort shall include:  <br>          1)  Development of the DESSTA Open System Architecture (OSA)  <br>          2)  Development, test and demonstration of a DESSTA DST system.   <br>    <br>  The government has less than $9.9M for this effort.  <br>    <br>  2.1.1 DESSTA Open System Architecture (OSA) Development  <br>    <br>  Generally the scope of the DESSTA OSA development effort includes:  A functional decomposition of a DST into the systems ( quote mark Antenna quote mark ,  quote mark Core Terminal quote mark  and  quote mark External Devices quote mark ) and components, the development of all interfaces between these systems, and the development of test procedures to validate compliance to the interfaces.  <br>    <br>  The DESSTA OSA should be developed using an open process.   This shall be done by the development of a consortium of industry experts.  The consortium shall include the Government (CERDEC), the offorer, and should include other interested industry experts.  A funding set-aside for industry experts is recommended.  The role of the consortium is to provide an open forum for the Government and industry experts to provide input and feedback on the OSA throughout the development process.  It is recommended that the offeror outline an organized approach for development, and execution of the consortium.    <br>    <br>  The offeror should be responsible for identifying and coordinating all proposed changes and deviations to the DESSTA OSA.

<DESC>The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is a mission critical, Safety of Life (SoL) navigation system within the FAA's National Airspace System (NAS).  WAAS provides LNAV, LNAV/VNAV, LPV, and LPV-200 levels of navigation services.  The WAAS currently uses Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 C/A and L2 P(Y) semi-codeless signals.  The United States Government Federal Register Notice (FRN) that DoD support of GPS L2 codeless/semi-codeless capability will likely end in 2020.

The FAA intends to replace the use of L2 P(Y) semi-codeless with the use of the GPS L5 civil signal under WAAS Phase IV - Dual Frequency Operations.  In addition to a new dual frequency SBAS navigation service, WAAS will continue to support legacy single frequency user services. 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) Dual Frequency Operations (DFO) will utilize Department of Defense Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 Coarse Acquisition and L5 signals to maintain existing Single Frequency User and provide a new Dual Frequency User Service.  The realization of an L5 capable GPS constellation has been delayed and therefore WAAS DFO has been segmented into two implementation phases.  DFO Segment 1 upgrades the WAAS infrastructure to enable reception and collection of the L5 signal with the WAAS reference station network and implements system changes required to sustain the WAAS.

<DESC>This Solicitation P14PS00258 replaces Solicitation P14PS00092, which is cancelled due to the fact that two projects were erroneously combined in P14PS00092.  Synopsis: The Department of the Interior, National Park Service (NPS) intends to issue Solicitation P14PS00258, using Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Services to Tuck Point all of the exterior walls on the Environmental Education Center (EEC) at Assateague Island National Seashore (ASIS), near Berlin, MD by means of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contract. The work includes providing all labor, materials, tools, equipment, supplies, transportation and supervision for the specified work as follows: Tuck point all the brick joints, approximately 1200 sq. ft, of brick walls on the EEC. The brick walls presently have a raked type joint which was the worst selection for a mortar joint on a building near the coast facing the northeast, so all joints must be tuck pointed. This contract will tuck point those mortar joints using proper technique leaving a weather resistance concave joint. Approximately twenty five missing brick must be replaced and caulk sealant applied along the shelf angle flashing at the top of walls. The color of mortar and sealant must match the existing color and meet ASTM standards. The performance period is ninety (90) calendar days from date the Notice to Proceed is issued. No Work of the Project will commence until Notice to Proceed has been issued by Government. This project is being solicited as 100% set-aside for Small Business. The solicitation including all bid documents is posted to the websites, http://www.fedbizopps.gov and https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect. No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed or issued. To receive the solicitation package you must download it from one of the above sites. It is therefore the contractor's responsibility to check the internet site daily for any posted changes to the solicitation. Contractors must be registered in the SAM-System for Award Management (Formally Central Contractor Registration) in order to receive contract awards. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 238140, Masonry Contractors and the Size Standard is 14 million dollars. The estimated cost range for this project is $25,000-$100,000 and is subject to the Davis-Bacon Act. There will be a site visit, and perspective proposers are encouraged to visit the site to satisfy themselves as to conditions before providing a bid. The date and time for the site visit is specified in the solicitation. For technical questions concerning this project, contact Mike Fatale at 267-528-1421, or by email at michael_fatale@nps.gov.

<DESC>The United States Department of Labor's (DOL) Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) is seeking a contractor to provide Workers' Compensation Medical Bill Processing and Mailroom services. DOL intends to award a single firm fixed price contract with other direct cost (OCD) pass-throughs. The NAICS code for this requirement is 524298 and the size standard is $6.5 million. The period of performance of the proposed contract is anticipated to be one year with four one-year options, and up to two one-year award terms for outstanding performance - for a total potential performance period of seven years.
<p>PURPOSE<br />The U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) OWCP administers workers' compensation medical bill processing programs that mitigate the impact of work-related injury for certain workers and their families.<br />OWCP is seeking a single Contractor to build and operate a centralized workers' compensation medical bill processing (WCMBP) solution for three OWCP programs: the Division of Federal Employees' Compensation (DFEC), the Division of Coal Mine Workers' Compensation (DCMWC) and the Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation (DEEOIC). OWCP's medical bill processing function is currently performed as a contracted service. The Government does not own an information system that can be transferred to a follow-on Contractor. Only historical data will be transferred.</p>
<p>This centralized solution will include the processes associated with receipt of the medical bills and attachments, review of medical bills and attachments against program-specific authorizations, handling of inquiries related to medical services from claimants and providers, and utilization of business rules established by each OWCP program for the adjudication and pricing of medical bills. Specifically, the integrated system will support the following capabilities:<br />&bull; Receipt and accounting for medical bills, attachments and other documents, in both hardcopy and electronic formats<br />&bull; Scanning and data entry of bills, attachments and other documents received.<br />&bull; Processing of bills to payment or denial (the Contractor will not make benefit payments, but will transfer payment files to Treasury for certification and payment)<br />&bull; Processing of requests for adjustment, authorization of services, suspense resolution, and appeals processing<br />&bull; Processing and responding to submitted correspondence received from medical providers and claimants, when applicable, and storing the responses to the correspondence in an imaging system from which the Government can retrieve for review<br />&bull; Enrolling new providers and managing information about existing providers<br />&bull; Providing claimant and provider support via a call center and self-service applications (such as user access portals and IVR)<br />&bull; Processing Point of Sale (POS) pharmacy bills<br />&bull; Providing secure on-line access, available to authorized users, to view images of bills, correspondence, and other documents.</p>
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES<br />The goal of the WCMBP program is to acquire a standards-based medical bill processing system and processes that implement the following:<br />&bull; Improved mailroom, imaging, and data entry throughput, accuracy, and efficiency<br />&bull; Ensure a smooth and timely transition from the incumbent service provider<br />&bull; Ensure efficient, accurate and timely processing of medical and pharmacy bills <br />&bull; Ensure timely and correctly processed authorizations for covered benefits. <br />&bull; Provide accurate and timely responses to customer inquiries and requests. <br />&bull; Implement advanced medical bill processing technologies and processes<br />&bull; Develop robust fraud and abuse and error detection/protection processes<br />&bull; Use of industry-standard hosting and programming techniques to support portability among platforms<br />&bull; Implement robust change and configuration management process<br />&bull; Establish a framework for continuous improvement</p>

<DESC>Modification to Pre-Solicitation:  The purpose of this modification is to answer requests for information.   <br>  <br> NOTE: No more questions can be submitted after Friday, 17 January 2014 at 10:00 AM. <br>  <br> W912GB-14-R-0010: Italy Job Order Contract (JOC): Questions and Answers <br>  <br> 1.  Question:  The synopsis says that the  quote mark The Solicitation will be issued on or about 15 January 2014 quote mark  and that the  quote mark firms shall submit material as stated below (...) no later than (...) 6 January 2014 quote mark . <br>  <br> Answer:  The original pre-solicitation notice due date was originally on 06 January 2014.  The Italy Pre-Qualification due date is now extended to 30 January 2014 at 1500 hours Central European Time (CET). <br>  <br> 2.  Question:  We had found out that the mandatory requirements is to have the SOA. We have noted that you do not specify an alternative for the companies of the remaining European Union Member States.  We just would like to verify that you are also taking into account the equivalent industrial classifications, by including the possibility of use the equivalent classification in each of the European Union Member States, in order to proof the technical competency. <br>  <br> Answer:  The Italy Pre-Qualifications are required to be submitted prior to the issuance of the solicitation.  These requirements are the country of Italy specific requirements.   There are no alternatives for the remaining European Union Member States.  Your firm must provide these Italy Pre-Qualifications in order to be considered.   <br>  <br> 3.  Question:  Reference solicitation W912GB-14-R-0010, Italy Job Order Contract. Qualification Requirements.  Our company, and we believe other companies, will require updating of the SOA certification to meet the requirements in the solicitation.  This process is normally a 60 to 90 day process which is made more difficult because the SOA offices will not process any documents during of Christmas and New Year holidays; from 15 December 2013 through 15 January 2014. It is impossible for any company to provide and updated and complete SOA by 6 January 2014.  Request USACE Contracting extend the Italy JOC Qualification deadline until 28 February 2014 so companies can accomplish the SOA certification requirements in the solicitation.  An alternative would be to release the solicitation without pre-qualification and have offerors provide their qualification documents in conjunction with their proposal due 28 February 2014.  This has been done in the past. <br>  <br> Answer:  The Italy Pre-Qualification due date is now extended to 30 January 2014 at 1500 hours Central European Time (CET).  <br>  <br> 4.  Question:  CH2M HILL question on Item 1: in case of Prime/sub binding teaming arrangement (not a JV) please clarify whether the Prime is required to have the OG1 prevailing Category or this Category could it be in the possession of one of the team sub(s). <br>  <br> Answer:  The prime is required to pre-qualify in the prevailing category  quote mark OG-1. quote mark  However, if the prime is not pre-qualified in all minor categories, the subcontractor is required to be qualified in the remainder of the minor categories in order to pre-qualify for the S.O.A. requirements. quote mark  The Offeror has to provide a teaming arrangement that shows how they will meet the S.O.A. requirements and letters of commitment for the proposed subcontractors.  <br>  <br> 5.  Question:  CH2M HILL question on Item above: Please clarify whether the  quote mark Mandato quote mark  is required to be submitted with the Proposal in response to the Solicitation (RFP) or not. It is our opinion that, since at the proposal stage there's no certainty of award, it is deemed not appropriate to bind irrevocably companies to JV for one (1) year, also because there are costs associated with the JV establishment and its maintenance that should be paid only after certainty of the contract award. There's also seem to be a contradiction in the clause, as the Government has the right to finally inspect and accept work and the work can only be completed at Task Order level under the Contract, so after the Contract has been awarded to the selected firm. <br>  <br> Answer:  Yes, as stated in the presolicitation,  quote mark It states that the Joint Venture Offerors shall, with their proposal (not now) furnish an Italian notarized legal document ( quote mark Mandao quote mark ) that establishes the Joint Venture. quote mark  This is not a negotiable answer.  The Government needs proof of the Joint Venture Agreement which will be required with the proposal submission. <br>  <br> 6.

However, the offeror must provide the original Italy pre-qualifications via hand deliver or mail by Thursday, 06 February 2014 at 1500 hours Central European Time (CET) or your firm will not be considered.   <br>  <br> 7.

There is no response required for this presolicitation notice. <br>          <br> _____________      <br>  <br> This synopsis is not a request for quotes or proposals. This is a pre-solicitation notice that a solicitation will be released via FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) to the vendor community sometime in the future but is currently 'to be determined' and cannot be accurately estimated at this time. This notice will be modified to reflect an accurate release date as more information becomes available. When posted, the solicitation will be available for 45 days. Specifications of this requirement shall be provided in the solicitation under Solicitation Number W81XWH-13-R-0038.         <br>                <br>      This presolicitation notice follows a Request for Information which was released as RFI Number RFIPRODDEVP on January 11, 2013.         <br>                <br>       The solicitation will be unrestricted and will allow for full and open competition.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 and the size standard is 500 employees.         <br>                <br>      Requirement Description:        <br>                <br>      This requirement is for all medical product development services required to support the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA), the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA), other U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) subordinate commands, and Joint Project Manager (JPM) Medical Countermeasure Systems (MCS) (formerly Chemical Biological Medical Systems (CBMS)) in their missions to develop and manage medical materiel to protect and sustain the Warfighter on point for the Nation.  This acquisition will provide multiple awards of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for services to support their missions.  Support services include support in the following areas, intended to support all aspects of product development: Technical/Administrative, Meeting and Informational Products, Clinical Development, Non-Clinical Development, Medical Product Manufacturing, Regulatory, Training, Protocol, and Information Technology.  This is a new requirement integrating and standardizing a multitude of different requirements into a comprehensive, efficient and economical approach to providing contract support for medical advanced development. This contract vehicle may be used by other activities of the Defense Health Agency when/if the USAMRMC is incorporated thereunder.        <br>                <br>      Background:        <br>                <br>      The USAMMDA and USAMMA, both subordinate commands of USAMRMC, are the Department of Defense's (DoD) advanced development organizations for medical products designed to protect and preserve the lives of Service Members.  The USAMMDA and USAMMA develop new drugs, vaccines, devices and medical support equipment that enhance readiness, ensure the provision of the highest quality medical and preventative care to the DoD, and maximize survival of medical casualties on the battlefield.  The USAMMDA and USAMMA direct, control, manage, and focus the development of medical materiel systems to meet Service-unique and joint Service performance, schedule, and cost requirements.          <br>                <br>      The USAMMDA and USAMMA Project Managers develop and field medical products for the US Armed Forces in conjunction with the Army Medical Department Center and School (the combat developer) and other service inputs (external partners).  Project Manager assigns product development to individual product managers and the product managers (PdMs), with support from the Division of Regulated Activities and Compliance (DRAC) and Clinical Support Services Division (CSSD), take promising new concepts and technologies developed in the USAMRMC laboratories and in the academic and commercial sectors, manage the development and testing of prototypes of these products (as necessary), and manage the products through the development lifecycle, ultimately to achieve US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, licensure and /or clearance, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registration, and/or approval of the developed product, to include post marketing commitments, for use by our Service Members through the requirements defined in the DoD and Army acquisitions processes (DoD 5000 series).  Thus, the USAMMDA and USAMMA product managers are responsible for the success (including cost/schedule/ performance) of the product development effort and must manage Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) through the development and implementation of development plans (and other acquisition requirements, as applicable), to develop and field medical materiel.  The USAMMDA and USAMMA accomplish their respective missions by exercising four core capabilities:  (1) Defense Acquisition and Program Management; (2) Regulatory Affairs (FDA or EPA regulated products); (3) Medical Product Development; and, (4) Coordination of The Surgeon General's Executive Agent management of Force Health Protection's IND products.        <br>                <br>      Depending on the product development strategy, the Office of the Surgeon General (OTSG), Department of the Army, may be the regulatory sponsor.  For these product development efforts, DRAC and CSSD are the regulatory elements responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable regulations.  In these cases, DRAC and CSSD may execute FDA regulated sponsor responsibilities or delegate some or all of these responsibilities to the Prime or its subcontractor and only provide oversight of these activities. In other cases, the product development effort will include industry or academia partners who hold the regulatory Sponsorship, which may also include foreign government marketing strategies.  The DRAC and CSSD may provide oversight of regulated activities sponsored by partners, depending on the capabilities or requests of the partner.  Specific requirements will be variable and included in detail at the task order level.        <br>                <br>      Additionally, DRAC and CSSD provide regulatory affairs and medical product development support for other organizations outside of USAMMDA and USAMMA, including USAMRMC subordinate commands, and the Chemical and Biological Defense Program.  These organizations may utilize this contract vehicle to conduct product development activities, which are being sponsored by OTSG and supported by USAMMDA DRAC and CSSD.        <br>                <br>      The CBMS Joint Project Management Office is responsible for research, development, acquisition, fielding, and life cycle management of FDA-approved medical systems for protection, treatment, and diagnostic capabilities against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat agents.  All CBRN medical countermeasures are approved by and regulated through the FDA.  The CBMS continues to aggressively explore opportunities to partner with other government agencies, industry, academia, and allied countries for all CBRN medical countermeasure efforts.  The CBMS product portfolio includes products spanning the entire acquisition life cycle.          <br>              <br>      Objective:        <br>                <br>      The objective of this requirement is to facilitate the timely and efficient execution of the US Army's medical materiel development program by providing a mechanism for all aspects of medical product/device development and life cycle support, including project management, technical expertise/assistance, strategic planning, market analysis, training, administrative activities, and pharmaceutical manufacturing and testing, assay validation, validated storage and shipment, non-clinical testing, clinical research (to include monitoring, safety pharmacovigilance and surveillance, full data management, and biostatistical support), regulatory writing and submission support, regulatory strategy and consultation, quality, integrated logistics support, equipment maintenance support and information technology in support of each task order.  For example:  a task order may specify that a contractor will conduct clinical trials worldwide (inclusive of pre-trial activities, trial activities and post trial activities),  provide product managers with support services to assist/provide technical guidance and provide independent and objective reviews, site feasibility assessments, prepare and assemble both generic and product-specific US FDA and EPA related documentation, take meeting minutes, provide complete clinical monitoring support including compilation of Sponsor trial master files, provide a data management system , preferably an electronic data capture (EDC) system, compliant with FDA/ICH regulations and guidance, data management, biostatistical evaluation and data analysis, safety pharmacovigilance and surveillance, and complete a final clinical study report compliant with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and/or FDA regulations and guidance.         <br>                <br>      Period of Performance:         <br>                <br>      The Period of Performance for this contract will be a five year base period with five one-year option periods.         <br>                <br>      Response:         <br>                <br>      This notice is for informational purposes only.  No response is required for this presolicitation notice.  Telephone requests in response to this presolicitation notice will not be honored.  Additional information is not available at this time.  Potential offerors are directed to respond to the Solicitation when it is released on this website under Solicitation Number W81XWH-13-R-0038.         <br>

<p>Synopsis:<br />Request for Information (RFI): Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB) Cockpit Upgrade</p>
<p>1.0 - SUMMARY:<br />1.1 - The Government has a requirement for the sustainment, modernization and enhancement of the A/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB) avionics cockpit.</p>
<p>1.2 - To fulfill this requirement, the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), is investigating alternative acquisition approaches, identifying the feasibility and practicality of each in order to select the most favorable course of action. One alternative under consideration is a hardware and software, "total avionics cockpit", solution. To that end, the Government is seeking interested industry organizations that can furnish the personnel, facilities, equipment and materiel necessary to develop an integrated avionics system cockpit for the A/MH-6 platform with the potential for follow-on avionics systems life-cycle sustainment and support thru 2030. Additionally, as a follow-up to receipt of RFI responses, a Market Research Interchange Meeting (MRIM) may be held for this requirement, tentatively scheduled for 12/03/13.</p>
<p>1.3 - THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued, however it is highly recommended that you respond to the RFI if your company has the capabilities the Government is seeking. If an RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps). It is the responsibility of the potential sources to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 - BACKGROUND:<br />2.1 - Since the baseline A/MH-6M began fielding in November 2003, the MELB Program Management Office (PMO) has conducted a series of modification (preplanned and unplanned) programs to keep the aircraft updated with customer requirements and modernized mission equipment. The preplanned Block 3.0 configuration is the continuation of a block upgrade strategy designed to extend the service life of the A/MH-6M while long-term alternatives for aircraft replacement are analyzed. Part of the Block 3.0 program includes a digital cockpit upgrade for a digital moving map (DigMap), battle field networking, and interfaces for rapid insertion planned technology upgrades.<br />2.2 - Weight discipline is a critical element of this program. The end state of the Block 3.0 modification is successful implementation of the identified level of engineering, performance, and cognizance without increasing the basic empty weight of the aircraft.</p>
<p>3.0 - DESCRIPTION OF NEED: Objectives for the MELB Block 3.0 Cockpit Avionics Integration Program and vendor capabilities/qualifications include:</p>
<p>3.1 - Cockpit Avionics Functionality: The following provides a high-level list of the required MELB Block 3.0 system avionics capabilities:<br />3.1.1 - Avionics System Management/Data Load/Maintenance <br />3.1.2 - Aircraft Systems State Display<br />3.1.3 - Navigation <br />3.1.4 - Flight Management <br />3.1.5 - Communications Management <br />3.1.5.1 - Two-channel data-capable radio in conjunction with existing communications equipment (see Section 3.3 - Hardware below).<br />3.1.6 - Weapons Management <br />3.1.7 - Mission Sensor Management <br />3.1.8 - Tactical Situation Management</p>

<DESC>Cockpit Avionics Integration Program Request For Information
<p>Synopsis:<br />Request for Information (RFI): Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB) Cockpit Upgrade</p>
<p>1.0 - SUMMARY:<br />1.1 - The Government has a requirement for the sustainment, modernization and enhancement of the A/MH-6 Mission Enhanced Little Bird (MELB) avionics cockpit.</p>
<p>1.2 - To fulfill this requirement, the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), is investigating alternative acquisition approaches, identifying the feasibility and practicality of each in order to select the most favorable course of action. One alternative under consideration is a hardware and software, "total avionics cockpit", solution. To that end, the Government is seeking interested industry organizations that can furnish the personnel, facilities, equipment and materiel necessary to develop an integrated avionics system cockpit for the A/MH-6 platform with the potential for follow-on avionics systems life-cycle sustainment and support thru 2030. Additionally, as a follow-up to receipt of RFI responses, a Market Research Interchange Meeting (MRIM) may be held for this requirement, tentatively scheduled that is to be TBD.</p>
<p>1.3 - THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Government is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if issued, however it is highly recommended that you respond to the RFI if your company has the capabilities the Government is seeking. If an RFP is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps). It is the responsibility of the potential sources to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 - BACKGROUND:<br />2.1 - Since the baseline A/MH-6M began fielding in November 2003, the MELB Program Management Office (PMO) has conducted a series of modification (preplanned and unplanned) programs to keep the aircraft updated with customer requirements and modernized mission equipment. The preplanned Block 3.0 configuration is the continuation of a block upgrade strategy designed to extend the service life of the A/MH-6M while long-term alternatives for aircraft replacement are analyzed. Part of the Block 3.0 program includes a digital cockpit upgrade for a digital moving map (DigMap), battle field networking, and interfaces for rapid insertion planned technology upgrades.<br />2.2 - Weight discipline is a critical element of this program. The end state of the Block 3.0 modification is successful implementation of the identified level of engineering, performance, and cognizance without increasing the basic empty weight of the aircraft.</p>
<p>3.0 - DESCRIPTION OF NEED: Objectives for the MELB Block 3.0 Cockpit Avionics Integration Program and vendor capabilities/qualifications include:</p>
<p>3.1 - Cockpit Avionics Functionality: The following provides a high-level list of the required MELB Block 3.0 system avionics capabilities:<br />3.1.1 - Avionics System Management/Data Load/Maintenance <br />3.1.2 - Aircraft Systems State Display<br />3.1.3 - Navigation <br />3.1.4 - Flight Management <br />3.1.5 - Communications Management <br />3.1.5.1 - Two-channel data-capable radio in conjunction with existing communications equipment (see Section 3.3 - Hardware below).<br />3.1.6 - Weapons Management <br />3.1.7 - Mission Sensor Management <br />3.1.8 - Tactical Situation Management</p>
<p>3.2 - Avionics Systems Integration:<br />3.2.1 - Interested parties should consider solutions that provide existing and desired capabilities including the functionality stated above and that follow the guidance below regarding hardware components with Size, Weight, Power, and Cooling (SWaP-C) considerations.<br />3.2.2 - Interface. Any proposed integrated avionics cockpit will be required to interface with a multitude of onboard systems and have the ability to easily integrate new aircraft systems. Integration of cockpit avionics into the aircraft will be performed by a third party vendor. Coordination with this third party will be necessary for full platform integration considerations such as installation, weight, power, cooling, data, and data interface requirements.<br />3.2.3 - A current and notional console layout is available upon request (Reference paragraph 3.7).<br />3.3 - Hardware:<br />3.3.1 - Overall considerations for hardware includes:<br />3.3.1.1 - Cube. Space is extremely limited in the A/MH-6 series of aircraft for cockpit displays, cabin Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), and wire runs. In general, available space for avionics includes areas behind and beneath the consoles, area directly forward of the center console, under the pilot/copilot floorboards, and avionics racks behind the pilot seats (Diagrams with approximate dimensions are available upon request (Reference paragraph 3.7).)<br />3.3.1.2 - Weight. As previously mentioned, weight is a critical element of this program. The weight of the cockpit trade space is estimated to be 120 pounds. (additional information regarding candidate core avionics components for removal/replacement is available upon request (Reference paragraph 3.7).) This weight value is only an estimate to be used for preliminary planning. <br />3.3.1.3 - Power. The A/MH-6 cockpit must operate on 28VDC power. The aircraft does not contain an AC generator. Additionally, aircraft start must be performed on battery power. As a result, critical aircraft state information must be displayed during the start sequence.<br />3.3.1.4 - Environment. The A/MH-6 cockpit will be exposed to harsh environmental conditions such as sand, dirt, debris, and moisture due to frequent open cockpit operations.<br />3.3.1.5 - Night Operation. The A/MH-6 cockpit must be compatible with Night Vision Goggle (NVG) operations.<br />3.3.1.6 - The avionics system equipment will be of the manufacturer's current design (Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Level 7 or higher desired), military and/or civil qualified, and capable of performing its intended function in accordance with the operation and performance requirements specified herein. <br />3.3.2 - Upon request, a list of some of the avionics LRUs planned to be retained as a part of the aircraft configuration may be provided (reference paragraph 3.7). These LRUs, including Identification, Friend or Foe (IFF), radios, Tactical Airborne Navigation (TACAN), Air Data Computer (ADC), and Radar Altimeter, must integrate with any proposed cockpit design.<br />3.3.3 - Mission-specific equipment and functionality, such as Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), may also be integrated into this platform as a part of the cockpit avionics integration effort. The Government's primary intent for this RFI is the investigation of candidate cockpit solutions with a focus on reduction in weight attributed to core equipment.</p>

506-14-1-022-0582,  Davol, Inc. 
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  
$3,400.  Davol, Inc. Delivery date 1/15/2014.  Diagnosis of lung cancer often requires surgical removal of lung tumors. After tumors are removed, air leaks can develop around the suture or staples used to close the surgical site. Currently applying a surgical mesh stops the air leak; however some patients' lung tissue is too fragile, for these patients the Pleural Air Leak Sealant Kit-Progel- is used. This provides better patient outcomes.
