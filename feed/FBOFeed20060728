<SUBJECT>R -- Development of Inpatient Psychiatric Performance Measures
<SOLNBR>06M000149
<RESPDATE>081506
<ARCHDATE>08302006
<CONTACT>Nora Tyson, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-443-5229, Fax 301-443-3238, Email ntyson@psc.gov
<DESC>The Agency of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), through the General Acquisitions Branch (GAB), Program Support Center (PSC), intends to award a 12 month sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to Joint Commission Division of Research, Joint Commision on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), One Renaissance Blvd., Oakbrook
Terrace, Il.   60181.  The anticipated date of award is August 21, 2006.

The purpose of this contract is to Development of Inpatient Psychiatric Performance Measures - The measure set, once fully tested and technically specified, will be implemented as one of the contractor's core measures sets and will be made available for selection by accredited hospitals, both psychiatric hospitals and hospitals with psychiatric units, to meet the
current ORYX performance measurement requirement. Once fully implemented, organizational and comparative data derived from these measures will be publicly reported at w.QualityCheck.org.  In addition, this set will be submitted to the National Quality Forum for consideration and endorsement.

The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment, materials and supplies, and perform the work set forth below.

All work under this project shall be monitored by the Government Project Officer (GPO).

All reports, statistics, or tables produced under this project shall be the property of the Federal government, which includes the Center for Mental Health Services	(CMHS) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).  SAMHSA or CMHS may utilize, print, or disseminate such material without further charge.

No other articles or publications which rely substantially on materials produced under this project shall be published by either party without prior consultation and approval.

Task 1 -
Meet with the GPO and other CMHS/SAMHSA staff in order to determine the best approach for accomplishing the tasks covered by this contract.  GPO and other CMHS/SAMHSA staff will review plan for consistency with SAMHSA priorities. Modify the work plan
in response to comments provided by the GPO.

Task 2 -
Measure Specification Development - Prepare the identified measure set for testing including development of the data collection methodology and data collections tools, finalization of the measure information forms, development of a data dictionary (i.e., data elements, definitions and allowable values), creation of applicable tables (if any), and development of measure calculation algorithms.

Task 3 -
Conduct Pilot Testing - In an effort to present this set of measures to the field for early use, candidate measures will be tested in a semi-operational phase.  That is, measures will be technically specified and made available for inclusion in extant listed-measurement systems and for selection by volunteer health care organizations.  Health care organizations opting to participate in this semi-operational test phase will be defined as project test sites and will be allowed to utilize these measures to satisfy their current ORYX requirement.

The contractor shall define and develop a database structure for electronic receipt of measure data and will undertake a modified verification process to assure that measures have been embedded in accord with the contractor's specifications.  The contractor shall also provide education to performance measurement systems that will in turn provide ongoing support to their confirmed test sites.  Additionally, tools to assess the reliability of data collection activities will be developed and a reliability test will be conducted at a subset of test sites.  Findings from pilot testing activities will be developed in a summary report for the expert panel. The pilot testing phase is expected to occur over a 9-12 month period.

Task 4 -
Convene Technical Advisory Panel In-Person Meeting - The Advisory Panel will review pilot test and reliability findings and recommend a final set of measures for full implementation as core measures.  The Advisory Panel will provide ongoing review and support to the testing of the measure set.

Task 5 -
Recommend Measures for Public Use and Develop Related Publications - The Contractor shall revise and finalize measures based on test findings and expert panel input and the technical specifications manual will be finalized and released to all Joint Commission-listed performance measurement systems for implementation.  Measures will also be submitted to the National Quality Forum for review and endorsement.  The contractor shall also develop publications for peer-reviewed journals describing the development process, test findings, and anticipated impact of the measure set on the quality of care.

Once revised specifications are released to the contractor-listed performance measurement systems, an additional 4-6 months will be required before data collection on these measures can begin. That is, performance measurement systems will require 2-4 months to uniformly embed revisions to the measures and the contractor will require approximately 2 months to fully
verify that measures have been embedded according to specifications.

The contractor verification process assures that measures will be consistently and accurately calculated by performance measurement systems. This process has two components: the first component determines whether the performance measurement system has programmed the core measure sets in accordance with required specifications and algorithms; and the second component evaluates the individual data collection tools used by each of the 52 systems that are supporting the use of core measure sets.

Task 6 -
Conduct briefings for GPO and identified SAMHSA/CMHS officials on the results of Tasks 4 and 5, and make changes to the draft documents in response to comments and recommendations; submit revised final report.  Using the meeting input on options for future quality performance measurement efforts, the contractor shall work with leaders at SAMHSA/CMHS and partners to develop a framework and business plan for collaborations to implement and sustain transformation.

Schedule of Deliverables:
A.  Meet with the GPO, and develop plan for SAMHSA/CMHS participation in Development of Inpatient Psychiatric Performance Measures -  (Task 1)  8 weeks after start of contract

B.  Submit draft reports describing - 1)  Progress to date on development and progress of Measure Specification Development;

2) The health care organizations opting to participate in the semi-operational test phase (Task3)

3) Related data and reporting issues supporting the Technical Advisory Panel In-Person Meeting logistical needs to be addressed (Task 4) - 12 weeks after start of contract

C.  Finalize reports and conduct briefings for SAMHSA/CMHS officials (Task 6) - 52 weeks after start of contract

<SOLNBR>2006-N-08835
<ARCHDATE>04012007
<CONTACT>Sam Jamison, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882921, Fax 7704882777, Email esw2@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will be issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) # 2006-N-08835 as an 8(a) small business set-aside for research to support the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD).  (Additionally, a second RFP # 2006-N-08556 will be issued as a full and open competition with different tasks from this 8(a) small business set-aside RFP. The particulars on the full and open RFP will be provided by separate synopsis.) The RFP reserves the right of CDC to make multiple awards and compete task orders among the awardees.  The term of the awarded contracts will be 10 years, beginning around April 1, 2007.  The RFP will be available in about 30 days only by downloading at this internet site: www.fbo.gov/ . All responsible 8(a) small businesses may submit a proposal for consideration in response to the RFP.  A wage determination has not been requested since the requirement involves meaningful numbers of professional employees as defined in FAR Subpart 22.11.

The mission of NCBDDD is to promote the health of babies, children, and adults, and enhance the potential for full, productive living including:

•	Identifying the causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities
•	Helping children to develop and reach their full potential
•	Promoting health and well-being among people of all ages with disabilities
Activities for which task orders may be issued:
1. Development and Implementation of Training Programs

a.	Training Programs, relevant to the NCBDDD mission, would include development and delivery of Professional Education programs, Public Education Programs, Orientation and Skill-based programs to providers.  

b.	 More specifically, the Contractor shall be required to perform the following types of training activities:

(1)  Develop course curriculum, including training materials, for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(2) Provide qualified Instructors and/or Facilitators for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(3)  Secure subject matter experts to use in developing, adapting training materials, or conducting training sessions for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(4) Develop web-based, CD-ROM, or other electronic based training programs for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

         (10) Develop and implement a plan for evaluating the training materials/program


2,  Scientific Forums

NCBDDD serves as a convener and facilitator to bring many sectors of society together to solve problems related to the mission.  Sectors that NCBDDD routinely interacts with include other government agencies, health care professionals, business/industry, educational professionals, nongovernmental organizations, and advocacy groups interested in specific disease conditions or health topics.  NCBDDD wants to ensure that events/conferences are planned, implemented, and evaluated to achieve purposes that are aligned with its mission.  Scientific Forums on NCBDDD’s topics must involve constituents and scientists who may have  disease conditions and/or disabilities that the Center studies.  This often requires involvement of specialist interpreters (with scientific training) and/or technology aids that are not usual and customary in typical conference logistics contracts. The role of contract holders under this contract is to coordinate the activities surrounding the identification of potential conference/forum attendees and speakers and assisting in the development of topical materials/agendas, etc.

The Conference logistics will not be provided under this contract, but will be provided through vendors holding HHS conference support/event planning Blanket Purchase Agreements. Conference logistical support includes managing of events and meeting logistics including inviting participants and managing registration, travel, etc.; arranging for audio-visual and other special equipment, facilities arrangements including set up, back drop, sound systems, etc.

3. Preparation of Health Education Products

a.	The Contractor shall provide support for the preparation and production of materials as specified in individual task orders.  Support for any given item may range from simply typing and editing recorded, handwritten or draft-type materials to conducting all stages of development, including research, original writing, and design.  Capabilities to produce camera-ready copies and presentation slides of materials will be necessary.

b.	Because some tasks will require the collection of large amounts of information and user-friendly access to that information once collected, some initiatives may require development of small databases.  Both paper (camera-ready) copy and computer diskette files shall be made available for all documents in the format and computer program specified in the task order.  Examples of specific types of materials required by the Government may include meeting minutes and reports, guidance documents, policy reports, manuscripts, and other documents.

4. Services in the Planning and Development of Workshop, Conference and Other Presentations

The Contractor shall provide support services in organizing NCBDDD sponsored meetings, workshops, conferences, and other presentations as specified in individual task orders.

Services may include working with partners and/ or providers to develop curricula and materials, locating and arranging for qualified instructors, coordinating and providing exhibit materials, securing audio visual equipment, securing sign language interpreters and TDDY equipment for hearing impaired attendees; making other necessary accommodation for visually and physically impaired attendees,  etc., when required by the task order.  Conference logistics will be provided by others.

<ARCHDATE>07282007
<CONTACT>Paul Griffin Contract Specialist 9077863818     paul_griffin@fws.gov;
<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7 Alaska, an agency within the US Department of the Interior intends to award a sole source procurement to the State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources, Office of Natural History and Archaeology, to perform work related to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 within and on several National Wildlife Refuges throughout Alaska.  This procurement shall include a sole source Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract award and shall include the following: Background: With the passage of the National Historic Preservation Act in 1966 federal agencies became responsible for inventorying, evaluating and managing cultural properties on their lands.  As a result of the Act the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was required to establish a preservation program for administering the Act (NHPA Section 110(a)(2).  The same Act established a nationwide network of State Historic Preservation Offices to assist in historic preservation activities and to advise and assist the federal programs (NHPA Section 101(b)(1)).   Section 101(a)(6)(A) allows the Secretary of the Interior to "enter into direct contracts or cooperative agreements with a State Historic Preservation Officer for any State authorizing such Officer to assist the Secretary in carrying out one or more of the following responsibilities within that State- (i)	Identification and preservation of historic properties (ii)	Determination of the eligibility of properties for listing on the National Register. (iii)	Preparation of nominations for inclusion on the National Register. (iv)	Maintenance of historical and archaeological data bases. (v)	Evaluation of eligibility for Federal preservation incentives. Work Description:  Individual projects will be described in more detail as the need arises but the Fish and Wildlife Service will in general develop small, specific project scopes of work within each delivery order placed against the awarded IDIQ contract to inventory for cultural resources on refuge lands, evaluate identified properties for their eligibility to the National register and prepare nominations for listing sites on the National register.   Specific tasks may include:  a) Identify and preserve historic properties.  For this activity the SHPO Office would conduct pedestrian surveys of the study area, dig shovel or trowel test pits as necessary, prepare site maps of discovered remains and thoroughly document in writing and with photographs and cultural resources found.  The information 	gathered would be of sufficient detail to evaluate the property for National Register eligibility. b) Determine the eligibility of properties for listing on the National Register.  This 	would involve analysis of the physical remains, as well as conducting archival 	and historical research to determine the importance and historic context for each property.  Each property would be evaluated using the eligibility criteria spelled out in 36 CFR 60. c) Prepare nominations for including historic properties on the National Register.  This would involve compiling all historic and cultural records and physical evidence and preparing a formal National Register nomination for selected 	properties.  They would also submit the nominations and shepherd them through the review process.   d) Maintain historical and archaeological data bases.  The State of Alaska maintains a statewide database of known sites.  We could provide support to the office to update database information for National Wildlife Refuges and to facilitate on-line access by this agency. Products: The products developed and delivered will depend on the nature of the task.  Typically they will include the following: a) Identify and preserve historic properties.  The product would include a report of the field investigation, detailing the methodology used in data collection and analysis.  This shall include a discussion of surveying and sampling procedures, the types of data collected, artifact and feature retrieval procedures, recording techniques, classificatory scheme, method of chronological determination, and any special analytical techniques.  Survey area will be described including detailed locational information, acreage of project area, and geographic description.  The results will include a brief evaluation of previous archaeological and historical studies of the region, including dates, extent, and adequacy of past work as it reflects on the interpretation of what might be found in the study area.  All discovered historic properties will be described in detail including nature, physical remains, maps, photographs etc.  An Alaska Heritage Resources Survey form will be submitted to the SHPO and entered on the state database.   b) Determine the eligibility of properties for listing on the National Register.  The product would be a report describing the property and a detailed analysis of the historic context (Eligibility Criteria) and historic integrity of the property (as spelled out in 36 CFR 60).  There would be a definite conclusion as to whether or not the property was eligible for the National Register. c) Prepare nominations for including historic properties on the National Register.  The product here would be the completed National Register documentation and a site being listed on the National Register d) Maintain historical and archaeological data bases.  The product would be updated  and complete listing of known sites on National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept any proposals or offers received.  Award shall be made 30 days following publication of this notice and an award announcement shall be posted at that time.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is one Operational Administration within the US Department of Transportation.  NHTSA is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths occurring on the nation's highways.  As one approach to fulfilling this responsibility, NHTSA analyzes vehicle crashes in an attempt to determine what environmental, human, or mechanical factors may have contributed.  

The purpose of this procurement is to provide NHTSA with the capability to investigate, document and evaluate a variety of vehicle crashes on a short-notice basis.  These crash investigations typically involve school buses, child restraint systems, new or emerging technologies in automatic restraint equipped vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, safety defects, adaptive control equipped vehicles, fires, crashes involving air bag deployment related fatalities and serious injuries and other special interest crashes as they arise.  Under this contract, the contractor shall be responsible for the timely gathering and documenting of data pertaining to these crashes.  The contractor shall also be responsible for the quality control of data submitted to NHTSA¡¦s Electronic Data System (EDS).

Specific objectives are as follows:

The contractor shall document pre-crash, at-crash and post crash circumstances and determine and describe the combination of vehicular, occupant, and environmental conditions associated with the identified crashes;

The contractor shall identify and report on all injuries resulting from the crash and associate each injury to the corresponding vehicle component or other object struck during the collision sequence;

The contractor shall determine and report on school bus crash configurations which produce injuries, the impact speeds involved, the positions of the children in the buses (seated, standing, etc.), and the crashworthiness of the buses involved;

The contractor shall examine and report on vehicles equipped with new or emerging technology in safety equipment to provide the NHTSA with information on the effectiveness of this rapidly changing technology, and; 

As needed, the contractor shall provide input on the effectiveness of the case vehicle¡¦s performance to existing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and Highway Safety Program Standards (HSPS) and /or any safety related defect.

NHTSA anticipates awarding three (3) contracts for these services in order to support three (3) major geographic regions within the United States (Western, Central, and Eastern.) Current plans state that no one contractor will receive award of more than one contract and that contracts will last at least three (3) years with options to increase the term by an additional two (2) years in one (1) year increments.

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to solicit and negotiate with only Ohio Emergency Management Public Safety Department, 2855 West Dublin Granville Road, Columbia, OH  43235-2206 on a sole source basis for the maintenance of National Weather Service (NWS) VHF equipment located on Ohio Emergency Management owned towers and buildings in the state of Ohio.  The FSC for this is J058, the NAICS is 517910 and the small business size standard is $6.5 million.  The resulting contract will be a firm-fixed price contract.  The contractor shall provide all maintenance and maintenance support services for 17 NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) transmitter systems at various locations throughout the state of Ohio.  The contractor shall perform routine maintenance every 120 days.  Upon completion of routine maintenance, the transmitter system will be fully operational and functional at the authorized output power as measured at the input to the transmission line, within the required frequency and modulation tolerance, and in compliance will all technical descriptions and specifications in NWR operational specifications and requirements, and the OEM equipment manuals.  The contractor shall monitor, via dial-in government furnished software, all transmitters on a monthly basis to verify that parameters are within specifications.  The contractor will accomplish all corrective maintenance identified by the contractor or requested via a service call by the National Weather Service (NWS).  All service calls shall be answered and responded to 24 hours a day, 365 days per year.  All site outages shall be corrected so that the Mean Time to Restore (MTTR) per site will not exceed 12 consecutive hours.  Maintenance will be provided so that no Contractor maintained transmitter system will experience site outage in excess of 88 hours per year.  A transmitter site configured with a dual transmitter is considered in a degraded operational mode if either transmitter is not capable of operating at its full authorized power.  The contractor will perform corrective maintenance on a degraded site within 48 hours of notice and restore it to full operation within 72 hours.  The NWS and the Contractor shall perform annual signal strength measurements to ensure that overall system performance has not deteriorated.  The signal strength measurements shall be made at a minimum of four different land locations approximately 90 degrees apart and a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 20 statute miles from the transmitter site.  The time interval between the annual measurements shall be from 9 to 13 months.  The Contractor shall provide the NWR focal point within 24 hours of completion of any maintenance on a contractor maintained system.  The proposed contract term is for one base year with four one-year option periods.  In an effort to ensure that the NWS carries out its mission of providing warnings and forecasts directly to the public to protect life and property, the NWS operates the NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) network to provide continuous transmission of recorded weather and appropriate all-hazards warning information to the public.  The NWR is linked to the National Emergency Alert System and the Homeland Security’s All Hazard Warning System, which enables the NWS to reach more people with timely, site-specific severe weather warning.  The Ohio Emergency Management Agency is the central point of coordination within the state of Ohio for response and recovery to disasters.  To ensure preparedness and the capability to respond at all levels, it is critical that the OHEMA interface regularly with local and federal counterparts.  To avoid duplication of effort and pursuant to the authority at 15 U.S.C. 313, and 15 U.S.C. 1525, the NWS and OHEMA have entered into Memorandum of Agreements for NOAA Weather Radio Broadcasting Services.  The Agreements state OHEMA will provide the equipment, facilities and installation of transmitters and NWS will provide funding for the maintenance of the equipment.  These agreements were entered into because a proportion of the residents in Ohio are not within listening range of an NWR station and OHEMA has existing transmitting towers in these remote locations as well as a participant of the EAS and the All Hazard Warning System.  Due to the sensitive and secure broadcast equipment each transmitter tower contains, OHEMA only grants access to State-commissioned employees.    The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement by 04 August 2006.  Written requests for additional information may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all proposals received within ten days after publication of this notice.  Evidence must be provided of the ability to provide required services.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  To be eligible for award, offerors must have a valid DUNS Number and be registered n the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

LOGISTICS TENETS APPLICABLE TO THIS PROCUREMENT:

CONTRACT REPAIR ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM (CREP)

EARLY INDUCTION:
(a)     The Government will forward a list of projections of total contractor overhaul inductions and the number of high-priority overhaul inductions out of this total for each ELIN on this contract every three months.  This projection list will be forwarded to the Contractor by the Procurement Contracting Officer (PCO).  The first projection list will be forwarded within 14 days after award of this contract.
(b)     This list of projections by ELIN is provided for planning purposes and may result in a contractor’s decision to induct the high-priority overhaul induction projections quantities and non high-priority overhaul projections quantities at the risk of the Contractor, in order to meet the 2-day delivery schedule for high-priority order quantities and the 30-day delivery schedule for the non high-priority delivery order quantities.
(c)      The Government shall issue delivery orders that indicate both the high-priority quantities and non high-priority quantities.  The Contractor will only be paid for the quantities placed on order.
(d)      The Contractor will not be held to the 2-day delivery schedule for high-priority or the 30-day delivery schedule for non high-priority delivery ordering quantities that exceed the aggregate 6 month overhaul induction projections for either the high-priority or non high-priority categories, respectively, during the three-month period after the Government submission of the quarterly overhaul induction projections.  For ordering quantities that exceed such quarterly projections, a 60 day delivery schedule will apply.

CONSOLIDATED REPARABLE INVENTORY (CRI)
(a)     This overhaul effort requires the establishment of a Consolidated Reparable Inventory (CRI) at the Contractor’s facility.    The Contractor shall act as the CRI to store reparable items shipped directly from designated Field Units, an Air Logistics Center (ALC) or from another Contractor’s facility.
(b)     The Consolidated Reparable Inventory Level is hereby established as a range of the aggregate total quantity of all ELINs, with an upper limit of the listed yearly quantities for each and a lower limit of 0 (“zero”) each.  Disposition instructions for items in excess of the maximum level shall be provided by the PMS or Contracting Officer.
(c)      Induction of an item for overhaul from the CRI shall be contingent on the availability of reps in the CRI in conjunction with the early induction provision, which allows the contractor to induct at their own risk.
(d)     Upon completion of the contract, disposition instructions for items remaining in the CRI shall be provided by the Contracting Officer.

CONSOLIDATED SERVICEABLE INVENTORY (CSI)
(a)     This overhaul effort requires the establishment of a Consolidated Serviceable Inventory (CSI) at the Contractor’s facility.   The contractor shall store completed serviceable items and ship them directly to a designated user at a Field Unit, Air Logistics Center (ALC), or other Contractor facility based upon a prioritized demand.
(b)     The CSI of end items shall begin when the overhaul of an item is completed and the item has been inspected and accepted.   For each completed overhaul (unless other shipment instructions have been provided) a WAWF electronic DD Form 250 shall be signed off and the item(s) shall be shipped in place to the Contractor’s Consolidated Serviceable Inventory c/o the Secure Air Force Government Bond Room at the Contractor’s Facility.
(c)      The Consolidated Serviceable Inventory Level is hereby established as a range of the aggregate total quantity of all ELINs, with an upper limit of the yearly quantities listed on Appendix “A” Exhibits for each ELIN, and a lower limit of 0 (“zero”) each. Notwithstanding the CSI level, induction of an item for overhaul will be contingent on the availability of a funded order, a reparable, and a negotiated delivery schedule.
(d)     At the end of the contract ordering period, the government commits to issuing a “Final Reconciliation Delivery Order” to buy back the overhauled valves remaining in the CSI when the ordering period expires.  (This ordering period shall include the option periods, if exercised.)  Since a reconciliation of excess quantities projected by the government (but not actually ordered) will be a continual process covered during the quarterly reviews, the quantity to be purchased by the government at the end of the contract shall be limited to the quantity projected by the government during the 12 months preceeding the end of the ordering period (for all other orders).  The contractor will be requested to provide information on the total quantity remaining in the CSI.  The government will compare this data to it’s own documentation.  Any disagreement that results will either be negotiated or handled under the “Disputes Clause”, at the government’s option.  The quantities on the final reconciliation order shall be deemed as a governmental bona fide need.  The final reconciliation delivery order will require the contractor’s input within 10 (ten) calendar days after expiration of the ordering period (for all other orders).  The contractor shall provide the final count of the total quantity remaining in the CSI that fell within the government’s projections during the preceeding 6 month period of performance.  The final reconciliation delivery order will be issued thereafter and shall be the only delivery order issued after expiration of the ordering period (for all other orders).  This process is expected to be complete 60 days after receipt of the final count from the contractor.  Delivery of the units ordered by the final reconciliation order shall be required within 30 days after receipt of the delivery order unless other terms are negotiated and so stated in the delivery order.


DELIVERY SCHEDULE:
*High Priority Delivery Schedule will be effective 90 days after effective date of contract. High Priority Reparables:  2 days after receipt of order up to the quarterly overhaul projections.  The contractor shall begin production even if all reparable quantities on the delivery orders have not been received.
Low Priority Reparables:  Request the delivery schedule to be 92 EA, 30 days from either ELIN, or a combination of both ELINs, after receipt of order until completion of order.  The contractor shall begin production even if all reparable quantities on the delivery orders have not been received.

*Quantities that exceed the aggregate quarterly overhaul induction projections during the 3 month period after the government submission of the quarterly overhaul induction projections will require a 45 day delivery schedule.

INITIAL PRODUCTION EVALUATION (IPE)
*An IPE (Initial Production Evaluation) will be required on all new sources, as well as sources who have not performed the overhaul in the previous 60 months.  The contractor will have 30 days to prepare for the IPE.  (If an IPE is not required, the contractor will have 30 days to begin production in accordance with the Low Priority Reparables Delivery Schedule.)  The reparables used in the IPE will be applied to the quantity from the first delivery order.  Upon Government IPE acceptance, the contractor will have another 30 days to begin production, on the first delivery order only, in accordance with the Low Priority Reparables Delivery Schedule.

ROB BACK
The contractor is authorized to “Rob-back” subassemblies or parts for installation on another end item to meet delivery requirements.

MISCELLANEOUS  
All serviceables will be shipped from the contractor to the user by utilizing fast transportation methods.

Shipping instructions will be provided to the contractor by phone, fax, e-mail, or other electronic means via the Production Manager.

A copy of all electronic Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) DD-250’s will be sent to the PMS within 2 days of shipment.

A Quarterly Production Management Review (PMRT) will be required at the contractors facility.  The Government requests that this be not separately priced and included in the quoted prices for the actual overhaul services.

A Preaward Survey is required if the apparent successful offer is not a previously proven overhaul service supplier for both NSN’s. 

Under the authority of FAR 6.302, the proposed contract action is for supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 30 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1.  The solicitation will identify the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.

Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items) in the planned solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested parties may identify to the contracting officer, their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS CLAUSE SHALL APPLY.  NO OBLIGATION MAY BE INCURRED BY THE GOVERNMENT UNTIL FUNDS AVAILABILITY HAS BEEN CERTIFIED.

SOLE SOURCE Item Description:  The 498th Missile Sustainment Group at Tinker AFB, OK will execute a Product Improvement Program (PIP) to repackage the Programmable Intelligent Multi-Purpose Fuze (PIMPF).  The current production PIMPF is 5 inches in diameter.  The Advanced Unitary Penetrator (AUP-3(M)) warhead carried by the AGM-86D Conventional Air Launched Cruise Missile (CALCM) has a 3-inch diameter fuze well.  Therefore, the objective of the PIP will be to repackage the 5-inch production PIMPF into a 3-inch form factor to fit into the current AUP-3(M) fuze well, without functional changes to the current production 5-inch fuze performance and safe & arming functionality.  This fuze will replace the Hard Target Smart Fuze (HTSF) currently in use in the AUP-3(M) penetrator installed in the AGM-86D.  The HTSF has design life issues that will affect future serviceability.  This effort will cover full US qualification, verification testing, and production of the 3-inch version of the PIMPF.  This requirement will be a 3 year firm fixed price contract.  A Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA) is anticipated and approximate NTE solicitation issue date will be 17 Sep 06.  The anticipated award date will be 19 Oct 06.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  Written procedure will be used for this solicitation.  Only written or faxed requests received directly from the requestor are acceptable.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-5135. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

Description:

Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services:

The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services related to the modernization and renovation at the Minton-Capehart Federal Building, located in downtown Indianapolis at 575 North Pennsylvania, Indiana.  Built in 1974, the Minton-Capehart Federal Building is a freestanding six story building with a Ground Floor below grade, with a mechanical mezzanine above grade, and a penthouse above the core area of the Sixth Floor.  Attached to the building is a two level parking facility.  It is the intention in this design and construction renovation project is to respect the Modern Era “Brutalist” Design of the building, even though the building is not yet currently listed on the National Historic Register.  The estimated construction cost ranges is $19 million to $30 million.  The construction portion of the project is estimated to begin in April 2009.

The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes the base contract for Pre-Construction Phase Services with the Construction Phase Services of the project evaluated as a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) option.  This will be a firm, fixed-price contract.  A firm, fixed-price for the general construction services will be negotiated prior to exercising the Construction phase option.

Project Summary:

Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture, this project will be executed based on GSA’s Design and Construction Excellence Program.  The scope of this project, as it relates to the planned modernization and renovation work will most likely included, but not be limited to, the following:  (1)  refurbish the air-handling units for greater airflow to provide the recommended minimum amount of fresh air for each occupant and improve the total air circulation; (2)  replace the fiberglass branch distribution ductwork and diffusers to handle greater airflows and to eliminate contamination from glass fiber in the environmental air, (3)  replace the stair pressurization fans with larger fans that will produce the necessary pressures and airflows; (4)  provide a new direct digital control (DDC) temperature control system for energy efficiency; (5)  provide additional commissioning of the system and other improvements for LEED-EB certification; (6)  utilize the existing dry standpipe risers in the stairs as a part of a new sprinkler system; (7)  provide sprinkler protection extending from the mains to each space in the building; (8)  provide a new fire pump and jockey pump, installed in the Ground Floor mechanical room, to boost the pressure for the new sprinkler system; as well as (9)  provide new lay-in ceilings, repair hard ceilings and replace lighting throughout the building with modular wiring and automatic controls for lower maintenance costs, easier adds and moves, as well as provide for greater energy efficiency.  Possible additional design work (Option1 1) and additional construction work (part of Option 2) may include the repair of the existing parking garage structure attached to the building, as well as the build out/backfill of anticipated vacant space on the sixth floor for a particular tenant agency.  The entire project will incorporate GSA’s design standards for secure facilities, conformance to the P100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), including LEED certification; and customer agency requirements.

The building will be fully occupied during construction.  All building systems will remain in operation during construction and the project phased to avoid disruption of occupants.  Construction will be accomplished with a combination of after normal business hour work (6pm-6am, weekends, and holidays) and swing space.

Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor:  A CMc contractor is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner or client (in this case the General Services Administration – GSA).    The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs).  In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor, the CMc is at risk and is involved with project development and administration of the construction.  The CMc shall be a member of the project development team working with the A/E and the Government to ensure a quality project, during the planning, design, and construction phases of the project.

Selection of the CMc firm will be in accordance with the federal acquisition regulations and source selection procedures using the Best Value Trade-off process. All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitations. The CMc shall work with the A/E, their design consultants, the Third Party Commissioning Contractor, and the Government in a cooperative team effort to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget.  The CMc will be brought onto the project during the design phase, during which he/she can be effective at controlling design-related costs and develop construction sequencing activities.  During the design phase, the CMc will be responsible for developing construction cost estimates and costs related to future project consultants.  For the Pre-Construction Phase Services, GSA intends to have the CMc perform other services including evaluating design concepts, reviewing designs, evaluating cost estimates, preparing independent cost estimates in various formats, controlling schedules, reviewing phases of work, resolving problems, participating in value engineering (VE) exercises, preparing commissioning plans as determined by a 3rd party commissioning agent, working with a LEED consultant to prepare for LEED certification, conducting constructability reviews, developing subcontractor and supplier interests, identifying long-lead items, and performing administrative and other services.  The CMc shall provide GSA with sound management advice regarding the approach to the project, how to achieve the best value in the work being accomplished, delineate necessary actions, alternative ideas, problem/claim prevention, and budgeting.  The CMc shall have a full understanding of the project, its contract documents, the principles of Federal construction contracting and contract administration.

CMc services for this project during the actual construction, Construction Phase Services (Option 2), will include, but may not be limited to, the following: administration of the construction contract (whether the work is performed with the CMc’s internal personnel or under sub-contract), coordination of regular construction meetings, CPM scheduling, daily logs and monthly reports, monitoring of construction costs, record keeping, progress reporting, schedule control, inspections, testing, and other required supplemental LEED services.  The CM shall have complete responsibility for the construction of the project.  During the construction phase, the CMc will be responsible for providing warranties on all completed work and for providing construction materials in a timely manner to complete the job on schedule and under budget.

Small Business Participation:  This is a negotiated procurement open to both large and small business concerns.  The NAICS code applicable to this solicitation is 236220 with a small business size standard of $31.0 million.  Although this procurement is not set aside for small business, small businesses including woman-owned, minority-owned, HUBZone, veteran-owned, small disadvantaged businesses and service disabled veteran-owned business are strongly encouraged to participate in this project.  In accordance with 15 USC 631, large businesses will be required to provide these small firms the maximum practical opportunities to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.  Each large firm will be required to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan that meets, and preferably exceeds, the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals established by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by the SBA prior to award of this contract.  Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.  However, all firms seeking consideration for this contract will need to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest possible subcontracting goals for local business participation.  In order to receive the benefit of a price evaluation preference as a HUBZone small business concern, firms must be certified by the SBA.  Please refer to the SBA website at www.sba.gov for details. 

Joint Ventures:  Joint venture or firm/consultant arrangements will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of the members to provide a quality CMc team effort.

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<DESC>The NAVAIR Depot (NADEP) Cherry Point, NC has a requirement to procure contractor support in performing and managing Life Cycle Management (LCM) activities of the NAVAIR Document Management/Workflow (DM/WF) Center of Excellence (COE).  Document Management (DM) technology is concerned with managing the lifecycle of electronic documents.  Workflow (WF) is the computerized facilitation or automation of a business process, in whole or in part.  DM/WF eliminates the need for paper and it provides instantaneous status of every task as defined by a business process.  

The NADEP is an aviation repair facility owned and operated by the Department of Defense (DoD) and staffed by civilian employees and military personnel.  The NADEP overhauls and repairs designated airframes, engines, and components and provides field teams and manufacturing, engineering, and logistic support services.  The facility is located in Eastern North Carolina adjacent to the town of Havelock.

The contractor shall provide DM/WF COE Program Management support, perform Definition and Start-up support, define all system components and site-specific architectures that dictate hardware and software requirements, define and record the architectural design of the system and the traceability between system components and system requirements, integrate code and design/develop specific workflow applications to produce a product that fulfils the stated functionality without altering the design and functionality of existing processes, and perform deployment and testing of the product.  The contractor shall also provide day-to-day operations support, defect resolution, troubleshooting and periodic updates to maintain and/or enhance existing systems, and also manage application shutdown.

The current Document Management/ Work Flow Tool for DM/WF development is e.POWER, for which NAVAIR currently maintains 33,500 licenses.  It is recognized that it may not be a case of “one size fits all” and a new set of requirements may fall outside the bounds of the existing assets.  Should software other than e.POWER be proposed as a solution for workflow requirements under this contract, the proposal must include a plan for acquiring FAM approval, interoperability with existing e.POWER processes, and providing the required number of licenses.  The cost for this software must be reflected in the cost proposal.

This procurement is being released as a Full and Open competition, but will be amended to a Total Small Business Set Aside if two or more acceptable offers are received from Small Business Concerns.  The complete Solicitation will be released on or about 14 August 2006, and may be viewed at the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) home page at the following web address:  http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/.  Please check the web site often for updates and Amendments to the Solicitation.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to perform preclinical studies of potential new therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of type 1 diabetes.  A clinical evaluation is not desired at this time.  

The Contractor will work closely with NIDDK project staff and external scientific consultants in designing protocols appropriate for the individual requirements of these compounds. The Contractor shall prepare draft protocols with the final design to be agreed to by the Project Officer.  The Contractor shall conduct studies of potential new therapeutics for the treatment and prevention of type 1 diabetes as agreed to by the Project Officer.  The Contractor shall prepare final study reports in consultation with the Project Officer for submission as Investigational New Drug applications (IND) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for support of efficacy and /or mechanism of action of the potential new therapeutic.  

A contract has not been awarded previously for these services.

The Type 1 Diabetes - Rapid Access to Intervention Development (T1D-RAID) program is designed to assist translation from the research bench to the clinic of novel therapeutic interventions for Type 1 diabetes and its complications. These potential interventions can be either synthetic, natural product, or biologic.  

T1D-RAID is not a grant mechanism. Approved requests to T1D-RAID gain access to the drug development contract resources of the National Cancer Institute's Developmental Therapeutics Program (NCI DTP).  The output of the use of these resources is provided to the originating investigator, and may include GMP synthesized material, formulation research, pharmacological methods, or IND-directed toxicology, for support of an investigator-held IND application and clinical trials. T1D-RAID does not sponsor clinical trials; it sponsors the work needed to get ready to do clinical trials.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for Ten SRAM-20 ARC-JET Test Samples for ST-9 Aerocapture Mission.  NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from Applied Research Associates. SRAM-20 is a thermal protection material invented by ARA Ablatives Laboratory. ARA Ablatives Laboratory is the only manufacturer that makes SRAM-20. We require 10 x SRAM-20 TPS material models with representative ST-9 structure that are 5.0-in. diameter short  cylinders, "Iso-Q" shaped, with a convex test surface of 5.0-in. radius.  The center of the SRAM-20 ablative layer will have a thickness of 1.3-in. and the shoulder of the sample will have a 0.25-in. radius.  The sample substrate will be ST-9 type composite sandwich structure (graphite face sheets with aluminum honeycomb core) supplied GFE via ATK Composite Optics, Inc.  The substrates will be 4.0-in. diameter (smaller than the ablative layer) so that the sample can mount to a standard test sleeve made from FRCI ceramic. Each ablator sample will contain an "instrumentation plug" of 1.25-in.diameter.  This plug will have four in-depth thermocouples set at depths of 0.02 (Type R), 0.40 (Type K), 0.60 (Type K),  and 0.80 (Type K) in. below the sample test surface.	Each sample will also contain a bond line thermocouple between the SRAM-20 layer and the composite structure and a thermocouple at the back face of the composite structure. These models are to be tested in support of the ST-9 program.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 11, 2006 to Christine M. Benavides at Cbenavides@mail.arc.nasa.gov .	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

STATEMENT OF WORK for Purchase of an X-Ray Florescence (XRF) Analyzer Introduction The National Park Service Intermountain Region has identified a critical need to purchase an XRF to test for heavy metal pesticides and chemical contaminants on cultural items subject to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in the custody of the NPS.  The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) is a Federal law passed in 1990 that provides a process for museums and Federal agencies to return certain Native American cultural items -- human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony - to lineal descendants, culturally affiliated Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations.  The Intermountain Region Museum Services Program is responsible for providing effective preservation of museum collections in it's custody.   Understanding materials composition is critical for developing effective treatment plans and long-term preservation strategies for these items.  XRF analysis of ten metallic elements is critical to this preservation effort. Background and Problem Statement Through consultation required by NAGPRA, many Native American tribes have expressed serious concerns about the health threats posed by cultural items subject to NAGPRA that have been repatriated and that may be repatriated in the future.  It is widely known that heavy metal pesticides were commonly applied to museum artifacts in the past to prevent damage from insects, but the use is poorly documented.  Full disclosure about the presence of contaminants along with information about possible mitigation and safe handling techniques is essential.  Due to cultural concerns, tribes have repeatedly requested non-invasive yet detailed data about the contaminants that may be present on cultural items subject to NAGPRA.  Full disclosure includes participation by affiliated tribes in all aspects of the testing process and presentation of information in a concise and accurate interface format.  Additionally, delivery of effective conservation services by the Intermountain Region Museum Services Program depends heavily on information about the material composition of an object, particularly for ethnographic materials.  This information is critical for developing appropriate treatment plans, determining good storage conditions, and preparing long-term preservation plans.  The identification of heavy metal pesticide contaminants throughout the 2.5 million objects stored at the Western Archeological and Conservation Center, and in Intermountain Region parks, will enable staff to manage the health hazards associated with their maintenance appropriately.  The ability to determine the heavy metals will enable conservators to improve both the quality of conservation service delivery and the preservation of objects significantly.  A highly specialized instrument that meets several key specifications is needed to address this Service-wide critical need to address NAGPRA issues.  Given that the majority of the cultural items subject to NAGPRA are curated by the Intermountain Region, IMR is taking a leading role in addressing the contaminated collections issue and is initiating the purchase of the XRF instrument.   The minimum specifications for the needed equipment are listed as follows and will be used to evaluate offers:  (12) Minimum product specifications:           	Ability to identify the presence of the following metallic elements: Magnesium, Aluminum, Silica, Chlorine, Phosphorus, Sulfur, Potassium, Calcium, Titanium, Vanadium, Chromium, Manganese, Iron, Cobalt, Nickel, Copper, Zinc,  Arsenic, Selenium, Niobium, Molybdenum, Rhodium, Silver, Cadmium, Tin, Vanadium, Platiinum, Gold, Mercury and Lead. 	A spectral display which clearly differentiates between Arsenic, Mercury and Lead when results are presented.  Spectral display can be fine tuned by the software to analyze very small peaks.  	Software that operates on a PDA and laptop computer and interfaces between the two and must be easy to install, manage, upgrade and operate.  The software must be able to custom calibrate the analyzer and fine tune the instrument settings.  A PDA with installed software must be included in the package. The laptop is not included or solicited as a part of this solicitation or package.   	The analyzer must be capable of tripod, or other acceptable equipment mounting with two mounting systems to enable upright and multi-angle attachment to the tripod that will enable upright and multi-angle attachment for hands free operation and without contact to the test subject.  The tripod, or other acceptable equipment, must be included in the package.  This will enable the analyzer to gather data without touching or damaging objects.  	The analyzer must be hand-held, portable, lightweight (under 5 lbs), and transportable via aircraft, with no damaging effects due to altitude and air pressures on this type of equipment.                  The analyzer must be capable of transport via air or land, free of any requirements or special permits to cross federal, state or local boundaries, due to radioactivitiy or any other conditions or components that require permitting or special handling.      	Training to be provided by the vendor at a NPS prescribed location for up to 20 technical and non-technical people. 	Post purchase support, within five years of purchase, not to exceed 50 hours of assistance with spectral identification, custom calibration, fine tuning, instrument settings, problem solving, system operation issues, and troubleshooting.   	Software which enables the transfer of a list of catalog numbers to the PDA for use in the field. 	A laptop interface with the analyzer that must enable live data viewing and projection suitable for multiple individuals to participate in the viewing process. 	Applicable Standard Industry Commercial Warranty. Past Performance                Past Performance is a measure of the degree to which a contractor has satisfied its customers in the past.  The NPS will evaluate past performance based on contacting references provided by the contractor, the Government's knowledge of quoters past performance, and / or references obtained from any other source. Quoters shall provide a list of five past contracts / projects, completed within the last three years, which they consider similar in nature. (13)  Quoters shall complete and return with their quotation a copy of provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items. Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. (14)  The Clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 811310   Under authority granted in FAR 13.501, the US Environmental Protection Agency intends to seek a quotation on a SOLE SOURCE BASIS from AVL North America to complete a AVL GEM 201L Advanced automation system.  The GEM 201L is a commercial product available for automated emission testing on chassis dynamometer test cells. EPA now possesses a portion of the GEM 201L system that was supplied under separate contract (68-C-02-024) by a subcontractor.  This procurement is to complete and upgrade this existing system. The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor  that possesses the proprietary software for this system.  AVL is the only vendor known that can supply the compatible software and is the only vendor that currently knows how to install it with the current software that EPA owns.  This system is critical to EPA's ability to automatically calculate  the emissions from the vehicle tests, format and print reports, download data to computer hard disk, and archive the data from each test run with the applicable Quality Assurance test results appended. Obtaining correctly calculated results and development of test reports are critical to providing  research results for publication.  No other contractor has or can obtain these capabilities because a market survey revealed that the entire system would have to be replaced at greatly increased cost if another vendor with a comparable system were used AVL is the only known source able to satisfy  the Government's requirement because only they have access to the proprietary software code and are the only ones with technicians that know how to install the remainder of the GEM 201L Advanced automation system. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However,  interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond to the office identified above.  Documentation must be received by August 11, 2006 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of  responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to Matthew J. Growney by fax (513)  487-2107 or by e-mail growney.matthew@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract. Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Malvern Instruments inc., 10 Southville Road, Southborough MA 01772 for the acquisition of Zetsizer Nano, Model: ZEN3600,for the measurement of size and charges of nanoparticles. Nano particle safety research is a increasingly important area for EPA and accurate measurement and size of the particles under study are critical to this research. The Malvern Instrument Zetasizer ZS is the only DLS instrument that utilizes  back-scatter optical particle size measurements combined with zeta potential measurements in a single instrument. A particle size range of 0.6nm-6000nm over a concentration range of 0.01mg/ml-30%/wt. The Zetasizer also has a unique sample temperature range from 2 degrees c to 90 degrees C,  controlled to 0.1 degree. Measurements of both particle size and zeta potential are made using re-usable but disposable cuvettes. This eliminates the tedioud procedure of cleaning and aligning cells. The Zetasizer also has an optional Auto-titrator that can automate the zeta potential vs. pH  measurements. This titrator is completely integrated into the system and includes controlling software. Other software features includes an SOP operating environment and the ability to calculate both Intensity weighted and Volume weighted size reports. Custom reports can be generated using the  Report Designer Feature. EPA has identified Malvern Instruments Inc., The only vendor capable of satisfy the requirement. The circumstance permitting is FAR 13.106(B) "only one source reasonably available".  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no  solicitation (RFQ) is available. Consequently, any response failing to provided the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose  of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Dr. Zhang Bo, Vice Director General, Shandong Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau, 12 Zhi Jin Shi Street, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, China, Phone:  (86-531) 8610-6106, Fax: (86-531) 8603-8443. Shandong Flue Gas Desulfurization Project.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study (FS) for the installation of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) and particulate control technologies in eight coal-fired power plants in Shandong Province, China. 

This FS will assist the Shandong Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau (SDEPB), the Grantee, with the identification, technical specification and installation of advanced U.S. technology for power plant FGD system retrofits.

Shandong Province is currently ranked the highest for sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions generated by coal-fired power and thermal energy plants. In addition to SO2, emissions, nitrogen oxides (NOX) and particulate matter (PM) emissions constitute grave threats to the overall health and living conditions of both urban and rural areas.  Such concerns have prompted China’s State Council, the National Development and Reform Commission and the State Environmental Protection Administration to impose stricter requirements for acid rain control and air pollution emissions.  In November 2004, in response to these requirements, the SDEPB developed a plan to control local SO2 and PM emissions by 2010. This plan requires that all coal-fired power plants install FGD and particulate removal – electrostatic precipitator (ESP) or fabric filter (FF) – technologies to reduce SO2 and PM emissions.  

Under this plan, the SDEPB is taking concrete steps to control SO2 emissions from their coal-fired thermal energy and power plants. The plan requires that all new or expanded power plants must install flue gas cleaning processes. In addition, plants larger than 50 megawatts (MW) or constructed before 2000 are required to retrofit with air pollution control devices for SO2 and PM emissions. Retrofits of older plants will be implemented using a phased approach. Older thermal plants under 50 MW are to be retired.  Finally, all coal-fired thermal and power plants are required to install continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS).  Each power plant must periodically report to SDEPB the status of its emissions control installations as well as data on pollutant levels.  According to SDEPB’s records, four small-scale FGD demonstration projects were completed during the Ninth Five Year Plan period (1995-2000), three greater than 300 MW plants were retrofitted with FGD in Tenth Five Year Plan period (2001-2005).  Currently, two additional plants had started FGD retrofits and up to six plants are also seeking sea-water desulfurization technology for SO2 abatement in the Shandong Province.

This FS would assess the technical requirements and financial feasibility of FGD and CEMS installations at eight specified power plants.  The list of power plant sites has recently been adjusted and/or substituted following a pre-appraisal mission by the World Bank; the Contractor shall contact the World Bank and the SDEPB about the latest list of power plant sites.  If the power plants listed have been substituted in the Grantee’s application for the World Bank loan, these changes shall be readily reflected in the Contractor’s evaluations and recommendations in the Study.  The FS will survey and collect existing environmental data, review World Bank requirements for power plants, prepare financial and economic analysis and develop a detailed list of potential U.S. equipment suppliers.  

Project size is that which would be applicable to some portion of the MW rating for the eight initial plants, and eventually that portion of the remaining plants in Shandong Province (and beyond) which will require and acquire FGD technologies.  The market potential related to the initial eight power plants is estimated as US$191 million for FGD and related equipment, and approximately US$8 million for CEMS.  The CEMS estimate is based on a minimum of one CEMS per plant costing approximately US$1 million per CEMS if it is assumed that the CEMS is used to monitor for the full range of air pollutants for regulatory compliance reporting and optimization of thermal efficiency.   Realistically, the total CEMS value could probably be higher as several of the power plants will have multiple stacks needing CEMS installations.

The Shandong Provincial Government has applied to the World Bank (WB) for a loan. The WB is in the process of reviewing loan applications, preparing justification documents and is expected to approve the loan by 2006. WB recently completed an initial assessment of FGD retrofit for the eight power plants. The SDPG is hereby requesting USTDA’s assistance in the provision of funds for a technical FS.

The proposed financing for the project will include a WB loan of approximately US$104 million to cover long-term financing of the FGD and CEMS investments and local government financing of US$108 million to cover local costs such as site and balance of plant design and construction. The approval of a WB loan will be subject to the successful completion of the FS. 

The proposed Grantee for this FS is the SDEPB.  With the facilitation of the Shandong Provincial Power Bureau and the Shandong Provincial Finance Bureau, SDEPB has also entered into a cooperation agreement with the eight power and industrial companies (and their respective design institutes) where FGD and CEMS units will be installed.  

The FS will be comprised of the following tasks:

Task 1:  Conduct Technical Analysis 
Task 2: Conduct Economic Analysis
Task 3: Conduct Financial Analysis
Task 4:  Conduct Environmental Anlaysis
Task 5:  Review Regulatory Issues
Task 6:  Conduct Developmental Impact Analysis
Task 7:  List Equipment for Project Implementation / Prepare Seminar on   Equipment 
Task 8: Develop Implementation Plan
Task 9: Prepare Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $515,300 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00 P.M. LOCAL TIME, SEPTEMBER 29, 2006 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)  intends to award on a sole source basis, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Dollar Threshold of $100,000) a firm fixed price award to the American Hospital Association, 325 7th Street, NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC  20004-2802 for “Hospital Cost Monitoring”. This contract continues the work performed under five previous contracts with the American Hospital Association:  Contract #500-80-0066, awarded September 26, 1980; Contract #500-87-0039, effective June 30, 1987; Contract #500-92-0003, effective January 1, 1992; Contract #500-97-0001, effective April1, 1997, and Contract 500-03-0006. These procurements obtain hospital financial and utilization data for hospital cost monitoring, actuarial studies and economic research.  This contract extends delivery of output from the National Hospital Indicators Survey and from the Annual Survey through January 31, 2007. These data are used by CMS to analyze the quarterly movements in the hospital market basket relative to trends in hospital revenue, expenses, and utilization.  On a quarterly basis we analyze market basket movement relative to the Consumer Price Index, the Producer Price Index, and Employment Cost Index, Employment, and other related measures. However, without the quarterly data from the National Hospital Indicator Survey we have no way to evaluate quarterly trends in revenue, expenses, and utilization.  The MMA required OACT to rebase the market baskets more frequently than every five years.  Data from the NHIS will be used to evaluate the relevance of the current market basket and as an indicator of when we need to rebase. This data will also be used to evaluate the accuracy of the newly created Quarterly Services Survey from the Census Bureau, which just began collecting data on hospital revenue, expenses, and utilization.  CMS creates and maintains a national baseline for marking the levels and inflation rates of total health care spending and its components.  The American Hospital Association (AHA) hospital data are an integral part of this work and are necessary to meet the agency’s minimum needs for information about the effects of health policy on the nation’s hospitals.  The AHA’s hospital data are unique and contain information about the nation’s hospitals that is not available from any other source.  The AHA is the only responsible source for procurement of the data we propose to continue to purchase.  The AHA owns the data and has established data collection and processing systems under the current scope of work to support the analyses required by this contract.  This contract is a continuation of five previous contracts with AHA, which has supplied the National Hospital Panel Survey, the National Hospital Indicators Survey (previously the Panel Survey) and the Annual Survey of Hospitals since September 26, 1980.  CMS has supported both intramural and extramural research since that time using these data, which have become an integral part of several large CMS data bases, including our national baseline for marking the levels and inflation rates of total health care spending and its components.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address
Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Office of Acquisition and Grants Management, Acquisition and Grants Group, Division of Beneficiary Support Contracts, 7500 Security Boulevard, Baltimore, MD  21244
Description
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to negotiate and award a contract, pending availability of funds, for Prescription Drug Benefit adjudication.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 524292, Third Party Administration of Insurance and Pension Funds.  This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  

Background

The purpose of this contract is for the contracted plan to pay claims for those unassigned dual eligible and LIS-eligible beneficiaries who could not specifically be ruled out as ineligible for the process.  Following a post-adjudicative screening against State Medicaid eligibility systems to verify Medicaid eligibility by another CMS contractor, the plan would enroll those beneficiaries identified as dual eligible or LIS eligible into their Part D plan and reverse all other claims. 

Description of Requirements

CMS will compete this requirement among those contractors that meet the following criteria:

1.	The contractor is a PDP Sponsor under contract with CMS.
2.	Capacity to adjudicate claims at the point-of-sale for individuals claiming to be full-benefit dual eligibles with no Part D plan enrollment who present at a pharmacy with a prescription drug need;
3.	Capacity to process claims against an extract of CMS’ Medicare Beneficiary Database, refreshed and downloaded to the plan on a nightly basis, or via an alternative methodology approved by CMS, with the ability to implement fortified security measures for such data;
4.	Ability to rapidly establish connectivity with CMS and its Medicaid Eligibility Verification Contractor, and to be ready to test such connectivity by December 1, 2006; 
5.	Capacity to allow for unobstructed claims submissions by out-of-network pharmacies; 
6.	Ability to reverse claims to pharmacies for any claims submitted on behalf of beneficiaries who have been determined or deemed ineligible for the Medicare low-income subsidy; and 
7.	Capacity for rapid enrollment of eligible beneficiaries into its Part D plan.

The contracted CMS PDP Sponsor will be required to have one plan in each region with a premium at or below the regional low-income premium subsidy amount in 2007.  As the low-income premium subsidy amount for 2007 will not be announced until early-to-mid August 2006, CMS PDP Sponsors who anticipate meeting this criterion will be invited to submit a proposal.  The CMS PDP Sponsor will be required to submit an estimate for incremental administrative costs, in the form of fixed price per claim transaction fees, in its proposal. Such administrative costs must be entirely exclusive of those administrative costs submitted and reimbursed under the Part D bid, such as costs related to enrollment and member services for enrolled beneficiaries, network contracting, or other overhead.  Should no contractor meet this criterion, the contracted CMS PDP Sponsor must agree to submit information on beneficiaries in the uncovered regions to CMS for random enrollment into another plan and use the plan-to-plan reconciliation process to secure reimbursement for the amounts of paid claims for the affected beneficiaries.

DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES
SECTION 1

1.1	Description of Services:  The contractor shall provide personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supplies, vehicles, and other items and services necessary to establish a Signal to Noise Enhancement Program (SNEP) at Edwards Air Force Base (EAFB).  The 95th Communication Squadron Frequency Management Office (95 CS/SCMFS) needs a measurement data and analysis process to control the associated electromagnetic spectrum encroachment, interference, and noise on EAFB.  The information collected and methods used will then be routinely updated to assist in identifying and mitigating noise and interference in the future.  Establishment of an ongoing program for EME data collection and analysis will allow EAFB Range to plan, budget, establish policies, and procedures to protect the range electromagnetic environment (EME).

1.2	Background: EAFB test range is experiencing an increased use of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum and adverse impacts from the increased RF noise and interference.  New emission samples include low power wireless RF device proliferation, increased operational emissions, and increased spectrum usage surrounding EAFB Range.  Adverse impacts are affecting the EAFB telemetry receivers, voice / data communications systems, and C-band radars systems at several range locations.

1.3	Task Description: This probe of the EAFB RF environment is the initial step in deploying a comprehensive RF environmental monitoring system. This Performance Work Statement (PWS) describes the services required as follows:

a.	The contractor shall measure and establishes an EME emission baseline in the 1-3 GHz portion of the frequency spectrum at specified locations on EAFB suitable for comparison with ITU-R P.372-8:2003. To capture these measurements, four (4) specific locations have been identified, by the EAFB 95 CS/SCMFS.  The primary locations are buildings 1737 and 5790 and secondary locations are buildings 4785 and 8377. This probe of the EAFB Radio Frequency (RF) environment is the initial step in deploying a comprehensive RF environmental monitoring system.
b.	The contractor shall investigate sources of electromagnetic interference/radio frequency interference (EMI/RFI) that adversely impact site operations.  The contractor shall analyze the impact of each source identified and provide recommendations and/or mitigation techniques for elimination and/or minimizing the harmful interference on the operational mission. 
c.	The contractor shall provide quarterly reports, recommendations, and findings detailing the items stated above. 
d.	The contractor shall develop usable methods and techniques to enable the contractor and/or the 95 CS/SCMFS to monitor the EME, detect noise floor degradation, and to identify the source of increased noise.  These methods will be used to develop an effective mitigation plan for managing EAFB interference and noise EME.
e.	At completion of the data collection effort, the contractor shall provide a complete turn-key product, including technical reports and recommendations of the entire analysis period, to the 95 CS/CSMFS.   
f.	The contractor shall provide system familiarization training for a minimum of two Government personnel.  Government personnel shall have a working knowledge of Windows based computer systems, GFE test and measurement equipment, and MATLAB computational environment. This familiarization instruction shall include a typed/scripted document outlining each steps used to collect EME data, analyze the data to make an assessment of the present noise floor and identify occurrences of harmful interference, and development of a mitigation plan.

1.4	The above effort begins the process of monitoring and protecting the EAFB test range EME essential to data collection during flight test operations. SNEP will provide an essential quantitative data foundation for EAFB collaboration with other Government regulatory agencies on spectrum planning and the resolution of noise and interference issues.

1.5	Quality Control: The contractor shall perform this service on two primary and two alternate sites to provide the equipment that works and able to collect data that can be analyzed. The methods and processes used are in accordance with nationally recognized data collection standards. These standards were used and proven in other locations by the contractor.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) is a leading neutron scattering research facility that serves a community of scientists from around the world. Approximately one thousand guest researchers visit every year to perform experiments, putting a great demand on the performance of the general pool of sample environment equipment used to generate the proper temperature, pressure, magnetic field, etc. This sample environment equipment must perform with high reliability and accuracy, be simple to operate and maneuver, and be adequately protected from abuse by the inclusion of safeguards on its operation. 

The NCNR performs basic materials research using neutron scattering. This research requires low temperature sample environments. Temperatures down to 0.3 K can be reached with He-3 cryostats. The recent availability of closed-cycle helium-4 coolers with low enough base temperature to condense He-3 makes it possible to provide NCNR users with an easy to use and reliable way of reaching those temperatures.

The Contractor shall configure, build, deliver, install and provide operational training for a cryogen free He-3 temperature controlled system for neutron scattering in a user facility.  A complete system includes the cryostat, compressor, temperature controller, and all associated cables and hoses for operation.

This requirement is being procured using simplified acquisition procedures under the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items via full & open competition.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), specifications, any subsequent amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number 
SB1341-06-Q-0604.  

The RFQ is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about August 2, 2006, and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.

Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award of any resultant purchase order.   No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Carol.Wood@NIST.Gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a sole source requirement for the University of Missouri, St. Louis (UMSL).  The model to be used in the simulation was designed and developed by UMSL to analyze the performance of locks on the upper Mississippi River.  It uniquely meets the requirements of the Navigation and Ecosystem Sustainability Program Team and reproduction of such a model by another contractor would require considerable additional time and expense.  There is insufficient time remaining in this fiscal year for such inter ested contractors to even adapt an existing model and properly conduct the required work.  The contract work must be completed no later than 30 September 2006 because there is no addition funding available for next fiscal year.  In addition, the current fu nding levels will only provide for adapting the existing UMSL model using new parameters, rendering UMSL the only contractor who can potentially perform.  The estimated magnitude of this requirement is under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.

<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service, Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle WA, requires operation and maintenance of an imaging-sonar unit.  Work to include:  assistance in site selection, sonar installation, basic maintenance and operation of the sonar along with collecting, storing and disseminating data from samples, etc.  The National Marine Fisheries Service, Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle WA intends to award this contract on a sole source basis to the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe.  The Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe owns the property where the operation and maintenance are to take place thus any potential contractor would have to negotiate access to the site.  In addition the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe’s biologists are located on site to give prompt and accurate data when necessary.  Therefore it is in NOAA’s opinion that the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe is the only reasonable source.  All responsible parties may submit a bid by fax to Shannon McIlroy before August 12, 2006.  The period of performance is 09/10/2006 through 09/30/2007.  This is a Simplified Acquisition not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLICATATIONON/REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  THIS IS 100% HUBZONE SET-ASIDE. The Solicitation Number for this announcement is N62467-06-R-0104.  THIS IS A 100% PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS CONSTRUCTION of Munitions Facilities at Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter, South Carolina.  The 2002 NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, and the small business size standard is $31 Million.  The Federal Supply Code is Y171, Construction of Facilities/Office Buildings.  Under FAR guidelines, the prime contractor must have the capability to perform at least 20 percent of the contract work with its own employees. The proposed solicitation will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the construction selection procedures of FAR 36. This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merits and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors' proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.  

The Munitions Facilities construction project consists of four separate buildings.  The proposed sites for the new buildings are located in the existing Munitions Facilities Compound on the northeastern portion of the base.  The site area is defined by an existing secured perimeter chain-link fence and includes munitions and equipment storage areas.   

The Munitions Administration/Mobility Storage Building combines administrative and storage functions.  The Munitions Administration/Mobility Storage Building consists of approximately 6960 SF of administrative space and 8042 SF of high bay storage for a total of 15,002 SF gross building area.  The new facility will be constructed utilizing a pre-engineered building structure with a 3:12 pitch metal roof and metal siding.  A 4 ft height, split-face CMU wainscot will be provided around the administration portion of the new facility.  The remainder of the exterior wall will consist of pre-engineered metal panels.  Interior partitions in the administration area will be metal studs with gypsum board.  Floors will be carpet in the offices and VCT in the corridors and break rooms.  Restrooms and locker rooms will have ceramic tile floors.  The storage bays consist of twelve bays (55 ft x 12 ft) for trailer storage and space for training functions.  Demolition of Buildings 1800, 1801, and 1803 will be required before construction is started on the new building.  Demolition of Buildings 1805 and 1807 will be deferred until construction is complete on the new building in order to phase the occupancy of the administration areas.  The total demolition area is 5000 SF 

The Four-Bay Maintenance Facility contains approximately 3784 SF of administrative space and 5166 SF of munitions maintenance area consisting of four drive-through bays for a total of approximately 8950 SF.  Three of the walls separating the bays will be Substantial Dividing Walls or “Blast Walls”, which are required for prevention of propagation of burning reactions.  The new facility will be constructed utilizing a pre-engineered building structure with a 3:12 pitch metal roof and metal siding.    Interior partitions in the administration area will be metal studs with gypsum board.  Floors will be carpet in the offices and VCT in the corridors and break rooms.  Restrooms and locker rooms will have ceramic tile floors.  Specialized equipment in the maintenance bays includes low and high-pressure air and 400hz power for support of portable air ground equipment.  A catenary lightning protection will be provided for the Four-Bay Maintenance Facility.

The third and fourth buildings are each 2080 square foot munitions storage igloos.  The storage igloos will have reinforced concrete bearing walls with reinforced concrete roof, floor and foundation systems.  The structures will be earth covered and will feature blast-resistant steel doors, explosion-proof lighting, exterior security lighting, an intrusion detection system, and a catenary lightning protection system.

The work for each new building includes communication and fire protection systems, all supporting utilities, and site work consisting of parking aprons, access drives, and landscaping.  The estimated cost of this acquisition is between $6,000,000 and $6,750,000.

<SUBJECT>D -- Translation Of Patent And Non-Patent Documents From Any Foreign Language Into Standard American English
<SOLNBR>PROC0600172
<RESPDATE>080906
<ARCHDATE>08242006
<CONTACT>Ann Miller, Contract Specialist, Phone 571-272-4028, Fax 571-273-4028, Email ann.miller1@uspto.gov
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Scientific And Technical Information Center (STIC) intends to procure translation services (all languages) involving the translation of patent and non-patent documents from any foreign language into Standard American English with an estimated value of $8 to 10 million over five (5) years. This is a re-competition of the current translation services contracts held by Foreign Language Service (FLS) (Contract No. 50-PAPT-2-01001), Ralph McElroy & Assoc. (Contract No. 50-PAPT-2-01002), and Schreiber Translations (Contract No. 50-PAPT-2-01003) which expire October 31, 2006. The USPTO intends to make award by October 20, 2006. This procurement is open to qualified small businesses only and multiple awards are anticipated. The contract period is for approximately a 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods. The first contract period is expected to commence on November 1, 2006. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541930. The translation services requirement will be to provide accurate, high-quality translations of 1) patent literature (patents, utility models, published patent applications, abstracts, etc.) and 2) non-patent literature (scientific and technical articles, legal documents, reports, letters, etc.). The material to be translated is primarily scientific and technical, can relate to any field, and is frequently difficult linguistically and in content. A partial translation of any given document may also be requested. The language mix and the flow rates fluctuate in the workload of the Translations Branch. Overall, the major portion of the work to be translated is Japanese and German. The target language of the majority of the translations will be English. Translation into foreign languages may be required from time to time. The USPTO reserves the right to issue task orders that may vary somewhat from the usual ordering procedures.
This acquisition will be conducted using the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG) located at: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/acquproc.htm. Under PTAG, FAR Part 15 does not apply and “full and open competition” is replaced with “maximum reasonable competition” which authorizes the USPTO to conduct this acquisition using an “alternative streamlined contracting approach.” Pursuant to this approach, this synopsis shall serve as a high-level solicitation. Following receipt of responses to this synopsis/high-level solicitation, the USPTO will evaluate the initial responses and establish a competitive range limited to a predetermined number of not more than five offerors. Upon establishment of the competitive range, those top highest ranked offerors will be notified and instructed on the next phase of the procurement process that will be the release of a detailed Request for Proposal (RFP) to solicit additional information and obtain a more complete offer. As a result of the responses to this Synopsis/High-level Solicitation, those vendors who are determined not to be the most qualified will be advised and will not receive further consideration. The USPTO will evaluate vendors’ responses based on translator qualifications, quality control systems, past performance, and pricing criteria. The offerors will be ranked in terms of qualifications and highest probability to successfully fulfill the USPTO’s requirements. Ultimate source selections will be based upon a best value determination. The process will include submission of an initial capability statement to the USPTO, an evaluation and a down-select of vendors by the USPTO. The USPTO is soliciting Capability Statements from responsible sources that clearly establish their ability to meet or exceed the USPTO’s Translation Services Capabilities Requirement (CR). Interested offerors shall submit a capability statement describing their capability to satisfy the size, scope and characteristics of the requirements (maximum of 10 pages).  The response must address four specific areas: 

(1)	Translator Source and Qualifications (1 typewritten page maximum):
·	A description of the education and experience requirements of proposed translators; and
·	Source of translators (i.e. university, private industry, company employee, consultant or subcontractor). 

(2)	Quality Control Systems (2 typewritten pages maximum):
·	A description of the process you will use to ensure the accuracy of the translations. 

(3)	Past Performance and Experience (3 typewritten pages maximum):
·	Provide a description of previous or current commercial or federal contracts that demonstrate an ability to meet the USPTO’s requirements and describe their relevance to the USPTO’s effort in terms of similarity of nature of work performed, size and scope. Include the contract period of performance dates, method used to determine word count, dollar value, point of contact and phone number.

(4)	Pricing:
·	Provide the price for translation of 1000 words by CLIN for German and Japanese per Attachment 1. Pricing should be provided for each of the three (3) word count methods for the base year;
·	Comment in 2 typewritten pages or less on the completeness and validity of the line items and units of measure shown in the pricing schedule per Attachment 2; and
·	Identify in 2 typewritten pages or less any suggested changes to the statement of work, clauses, contract duration that may improve the quality and pricing under the proposed contract. 

Since all procurement-related documents will be released via the Internet, a mailing list and/or list of interested vendors will not be available. The USPTO anticipates awarding one or more contract(s) as a result of this competition. It is anticipated that the contract type will be a firm fixed price requirements contract. All relevant documents for this procurement will be posted on the USPTO website at the Internet address: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/comp/proc/currproj.htm. It is the responsibility of each prospective offeror to check the project web site regularly for amendments, questions and answers, and other pertinent information concerning the procurement. An offeror’s failure to check the website will not be a justifiable excuse for requesting an extension to the response due date. 

Questions should be forwarded via e-mail to Ann F. Miller @ ann.miller1@uspto.gov, and must be received by 2:00 p.m. (EDST) on Tuesday, July 25, 2006.  Questions received after this date will not be entertained.  Responses to questions will be posted on the USPTO website. 
Responses to this request should be forwarded via e-mail to Ann F. Miller @ ann.miller1@uspto.gov, and must be received no later than 2:00 p.m. (EDST) on Wednesday, August 9, 2006.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to revise page 7 of the Statement of Work in the RFP by deleting two of the models listed for possible Contractor selection for completing Task 4.  A further explanation of this revision is provided below in the form of a question and answer:
Question: 
Will the Government provide the code for the models required to complete Task 4 to the Contractor, to be run on the Contractor’s computer systems? Alternatively, will the Government provide the Contractor with the means to run these models on the Government’s computer systems? 
Answer:
Due to uncertainties in the ability make the STOA and ISPM models available, the government has decided to remove these from the list of models to be considered for completing Task 4 of this RFP.  Therefore, the only models available to fulfill this contract are STOA-2, HAFv2, and CME-ICME.
The STOA-2 model developer has agreed to provide access, to the successful bidder, to a web interface for running the STOA-2 model. 
Note that Exploration Physics International,  Inc., (EXPI)  retains commercial proprietary rights to the Hakamada-Akasofu-Fry  (HAFv2) model. HAFv2 is also subject to Export Control.  Questions concerning the HAFv2 model can be directed to:

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) is seeking an Expression of Interest (EOI) from prospective contractors who may be interested in competing for a Technical Support Contract to assist OCRWM in completing, submitting and defending a License Application (LA) for the Repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  The background and types of services we will be contracting for are as follows: Background: The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) is responsible for implementation of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), P.L. 97 425, as amended. The Act provides for the siting, construction and operation of repositories for the permanent disposal of high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, in a manner that fully protects the health and safety of the public and the quality of the environment. Previous Sources Sought: On June 23, 2006, OCRWM issued a sources sought for small business to perform a technical support services (DE-SS28-06RWTSS) Contract.  The scope described for that effort was very broad.  OCRWM is now considering obtaining these services through three separate contracts. These contracts would be structured to provide support for OCRWM Transportation Planning and Implementation; expert support to OCRWM in completing, submitting and potentially defending a license application for a repository at Yucca Mountain; and Professional and Technical assistance to OCRWM in performing its management and administration activities. Types of Services: Prospective contractors must be able to provide Expert Technical Support to the Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program as it develops and defends its License Application for a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain. This support will include, but not be limited to assisting DOE in: â€¢ Ensuring the sufficiency and readiness of licensing documents for filing with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) â€¢ Technical reviews of design documents and operating plans for surface nuclear facilities â€¢ Technical reviews of tunneling plans and underground facility designs â€¢ Technical review of operating plans for subsurface facilities â€¢ Technical reviews of science and performance assessments â€¢ Preparing an organization to be an NRC licensee â€¢ Explaining highly technical subject matter to a non-technical audience This support will require significant experience and expertise in:   NRC licensing, nuclear facility design and operations, tunnel design and operations, and working in an NRC regulated environment. Note:  The contractor will provide technical support to the Federal OCRWM staff, at DOE Headquarters (Forrestal Building) in Washington, D.C. and in Las Vegas, NV, in support of this mission. Expression of Interest: This announcement is part of market research to identify sources that have long term experience in the design and operation of nuclear facilities, the knowledge, skills and capacity to assist and advise OCRWM in managing the completion of the Yucca Mountain NRC license application; license defense; and the evaluation and implementation of the processes, approaches, and technology needed to construct and operate the repository. Responses should be short, no more than 15 pages, specifically addressed to this EOI, and prepared in a manner similar to an annotated outline which clearly identifies:  the experience and capability of the source to successfully perform the tasks identified in the previous section; the sourceâ€™s long term (>10 years) corporate experience relevant to design, construction and operation of nuclear facilities; the expertise, capability and quality of its staff, partners or subcontractors; and, its ability to work in a collaborative work environment in support of a project owner such as the DOE.  Published general literature, marketing material or general capability statements should not be included in this response. Interested business concerns are requested to submit a statement showing their firms experience and capability to perform the above tasks via the DOE Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS). Responses to this EOI must be submitted via the DOE IIPS at http://doe-iips.pr.doe.gov/ no later than 8:00 p.m., Eastern time, on August 10, 2006. Interested parties must register via the IIPS web site prior to responding to this EOI. Instructions on how to submit your response can be found in the help document located on the IIPS web site listed above. For technical assistance, firms should call 1-800-683-0751 or e-mail the IIPS administrator at iips@pr.doe.gov. This EOI notice does not constitute a request for formal proposal or a pre-solicitation notice. This notice is provided as information to the marketplace and is an invitation for an EOI and demonstration of capability to perform the anticipated work. The Government will not pay for the provision of any information nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information. While a future Request for Proposal is anticipated, it is not guaranteed. No formal proposals other than the EOI, identified above, will be accepted or reviewed.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENDED SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE: The US Department of Education (ED), Office of Civil Rights (OCR), requires a contractor to download/mount and maintain survey data on website.

Vendor:	Beyond 20/20, 265 Carling Avenue, Suite 500, Ottawa, Ontario K1S2E1

ED/OCR requires a vendor to mount 2004 Civil Rights Data Collection records, and maintain the 2000 and 2002 Elementary and Secondary (E&S) Civil Rights data on the Internet for external users.  OCR has made this data available on the Web starting with the 1998 E&S Survey.  The data is being maintained on the Web in Vista 3.0, an OLAP application that enables users to access and analyze multidimensional data on the Web with little or no training.  The 2004 Civil Rights Data Collection data file to be mounted on the Web is in ASCII format, with descriptive information in Excel spreadsheets.  The 2000 and 2002 data would also be available in ASCII format.  The vendor will be required to create appropriate DBF suitable for data loading and maintaining all E&S data maintained on the Internet on behalf of ED. 

Beyond 20/20 has maintained the function on behalf of OCR for several years.  Beyond 20/20 offers the benefits of historical expertise and systems compatibility which other contractors may not be able to provide as cost-effectively or as timely.  

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotations.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, all quotations received by the posted response date will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This request does not commit the US Department of Education to award any purchase order, to pay any costs incurred related to quotations or subsequent negotiations, if any.  It is also the Offeror's responsibility to inform the US Department of Education of any present, pending or possible future conflicts of interest.

Requirement:  (Note: The description herein is a summary of the required services and is not intended to be all-inclusive).

Overview:  This is a performance based service specification to provide for monthly Operations and Maintenance (O&M) services in support of the Base Telecommunications System (BTS) and infrastructure (and Switchboard Operations if required).  The BTS consists of the base switching system, the fiber optic or copper distribution systems on premise and all associated equipment currently or that may be added during the term of any resultant contract.  The service level provides for and requires the Contractor to furnish commercial grade operation and maintenance support services that recur on a monthly basis.  These basic monthly services (BMS) are standard support services necessary to operate and maintain the base communications switching and distribution systems IAW the original equipment manufacturer’s recommended schedule and established commercial grade specifications, standards and best practices as set forth in SOW. 

During the performance of this contract, the Contractor may be required to provide for and support base mission changes, major or minor BTS infrastructure modifications, and other support requirements necessary for the BTS to meet mission requirements.  Support requirements may originate from technology changes, hardware and software systems upgrade, reconfigurations, new or additional equipment, local area network installations and upgrade, dial central office reconfigurations to include routing and diversity requirements and any other environmental changes that could impact or alter the base BTS requirements.  This contract may also be used to install telecommunications wiring in dormitories, military family housing, visiting airmen’s and officer’s quarters, temporary lodging facilities, other communications systems and devices, etc.

The primary objective of this acquisition is to provide for monthly Operations and Maintenance (O&M) services in support of the Base Telecommunications System (BTS) and infrastructure (and Switchboard Operations if required).  The BTS consists of the base switching system, the fiber optic or copper distribution systems on premise and all associated equipment or that may be added during the term of any resultant contract.  The scope of the current contracts includes O&M of the government-owned telephone switch, customer premise equipment, inside & outside cable plant, wiring in dorms/housing, and any communications equipment identified as being a part of a base's communications mission (i.e., land mobile radios, telephone operators, etc.).  O&M contracts give the base communications squadrons the latitude to expand its communications requirements/support over the life of the contract (typically a five-year period). 

Telephone O&M services in AETC are currently provided on a one base-one contract basis.  The Government seeks to consolidate Telephone O&M services to eight AETC facilities that meet or exceed the required service level through one command-wide Telephone O&M service contract. 

System Requirements:
1) The vendor must be able to provide Telephone services to eight geographically separated CONUS Air Force facilities.

2) The Government seeks to consolidate telephone O&M services to reduce the recurring service charges and infrastructure maintenance costs to the Government through use of innovative cost arrangements. 

System Compatibility: Interested vendors should respond via e-mail their capability statement/information to listed point of contacts. The capabilities statement/information should include as a minimum a detailed description of your service (including requirements/system compatibility, software and hardware maintenance/modification/ upgrade requirements), catalog, brochure, business size (i.e., small business, large business, small disadvantaged business, etc.), and prices (including maintenance costs). 

Small Business (SB) Set-Aside Determination:
The Government reserves the right to decide whether or not a SB set-aside is appropriate for this acquisition based on responses to this notice.  In order for the Government to make a SB set-aside determination, it is emphasized that SB concerns provide sufficient written information to indicate their capability to successfully perform and manage all the requirements of this magnitude.  In the solicitation, the extent to which prime contractors provide for the significant use of small and small disadvantaged business subcontractors will be a consideration in the evaluation of proposals.

<SOLNBR>W911SG06SS0001

<CONTACT>Hugo White, 9155685521
<DESC>Sources Sought - Request for Materiel and Non-Materiel Approaches for the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Functional Solutions Analysis 3. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations paragraph 15.201 (e.), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  1.  Purpose.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) in support of the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) Functional Solution Analysis (FSA) 3, Ac tive Air Defense against Air and Cruise Missile Threats.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify non-materiel (doctrine, training, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities) and materiel approaches to mitigate or resolve the FSA 3 gaps linked to the IAMD joint engagement sequence.  2.  Background.  Per the Joint Requirements Oversight Council Memorandum 072-06, the US Army is assigned as the lead sponsor for the conduct of FSA 3.  FSA 3 addresses all air-breathing threats, with emphasis on stressi ng targets, using organic and non-organic sensor data to support advanced engagements and optimize the joint engagement sequence.  The objective of the FSA is to identify the best approaches (non-materiel and materiel) to mitigating or solving the cited FS A capability gaps.  FSA 3 will focus primarily on seven capability gaps.  Five of these primary gaps are air and cruise missile related and concern gaps or needs with respect to the detection, tracking, identification, threat evaluation and weapons assignm ent, and act (destroy) functions of the joint engagement sequence.  The other two primary gaps pertain to tracking and destroying rocket, artillery, and mortar threats in the air.  Their incorporation into the FSA was directed by the Headquarters Departmen t of the Army. 3.  Scope.  FSA 3 focuses on a theater environment.  However, its findings and recommendations may be applied to any area of operations/area of responsibility.  The time frame for this analysis is 2015; this time frame is extended to 2025 for the analysis of materiel approaches to ensure that the contributions of potential technological approaches are considered. 3.  Instructions.  Responses/approaches to mitigating or solving the cited gaps should be submitted using the prescribed template.  The template, with accompanying explanation/examples for materiel and non-materiel submissions, can be obtained from the IAMD CBA Knowledge Center; access information is provided in paragraph #4.  The template is the primary means for submitting and subsequent evaluatio n of the inputs.  Incomplete/unclear template entries may not be reviewed.  Submitters are encouraged to provide additional information (e.g., briefings, white papers), where appropriate, to complement their templates.  This additional data is not mandator y, but it may facilitate increased understanding, and therefore more effective assessment of the submitted approach.  Government agencies and others are also requested to submit alternative concepts of operation (Alt CONOPS) to solving the cited gaps.  The  Alt CONOPS are non-materiel approaches that offer options to the way we currently conduct operations or will do so in the future.  All submissions may be classified up to SECRET.  Additional security restrictions (e.g., NOFORN) should also be suitably pre sented.  It is likely that other data, above the SECRET level, will be required to assist in mitigating/resolving the capability gaps; separate instructions will be published to solicit such responses.  Inputs will initially be screened in accordance with the criteria provided in the FSA 3 Study Plan.  Additional criteria will be used to assess each submissions ability to address one or more of the capability gaps.  This additional criterion will be presented at Industry Day, which is tentatively scheduled  for 17 August 2006, in Huntsville, Alabama. 4.  Site Access.  Backgro und/supporting IAMD CBA data for this RFI (to include the classified capability gaps with supplemental explanations (what does the gap really mean), the classified IAMD Joint Capability Document (SECRET NOFORN), submission templates, and the unclassified F SA 3 Study Plan) can be accessed through the IAMD CBA Knowledge Center site on AKO-S.  To gain access to the IAMD CBA Knowledge Center, you must first register for an AKO-S account at the following site: http://www.us.army.smil.mil/suite/login/welcome.html # using the following procedures: Click on the Register for AKO-S link. Click on the Create Guest Account button. Fill in all required information.  Note:  you will need to have an Army sponsor to approve your account.  The sponsors information will be requested during the registration pr ocess.  If you cannot find an Army Sponsor contact Mr. Edwards. Once you have registered, email Mr. Edwards your AKO-S username.  His AKO-S email address is eddie.edwards@us.army.smil.mil.  This email must be submitted through a SIPRNET (SECRET network) connection.  If you have any questions, contact Mr. Edwards.  Afte r your credentials are validated, you will be granted access to the Knowledge Center that contains the IAMD CBA files.  Once access is granted, you will receive an email (via SIPRNET) that will contain a link to the Knowledge Center. 5.  Response Submittals.  Responses (templates and additional documentation, as appropriate) should be electronically emailed to Mr. Edwards via SIPRNET.  Alternatively, hard copies, to include CDs, may also be hand delivered or mailed.  The mailing addres s is Commandant, US Army Air Defense Artillery School, ATTN: ATSA-CD (Mr. Edwards), 5800 Carter Road, Fort Bliss, TX 79916-3802.  Any proprietary information must be identified.  The statement Releasable to US Government Agencies and their supporting Cont ractors for Review Only must accompany any proprietary submission.  Responses are requested no later than 30 August 2006; extensions will not be considered.  6.  Points of Contact.

The NIAID Specimen Repository (NSR) is critical to the scientific integrity of on-going and future studies concerning HIV diagnosis, pathogenesis, disease progression, assessment of treatments, vaccine efficacy and other preventive measures.  The following is a general description of this effort:  (1) If applicable, perform an initial transition of equipment, specimens, and data from the incumbent contractor if not successful; 2) Secure, receive, catalog, process, store, and disburse human biological specimens from subjects participating in NIAID-sponsored treatment, prevention, and/or cohort studies;
(3)Provide adequate cold storage facilities and equipment for clinical specimens;(4)Provide shipping materials and documents, technical assistance and training to Site personnel and study teams on specimen handling and shipping, and communicate with the NIAID Project Officer; 5) Develop, perform, and maintain Quality Assurance systems for the NIAID Specimen Repository (NSR) facility, operations, stored specimens, shipping materials, and personnel and in accordance with all applicable Federal, State, and local regulatory requirements;(6)Provide (or utilize the current) computerized Specimen Inventory Database Management System (SIDMS) that supports NSR functions; and(7)  Provide a technical and administrative infrastructure to ensure efficient planning, initiation, implementation, and management of NSR activities; and (8)Develop and implement a Final Transition Plan at the end of the contract.  If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting their interest and a capability statement demonstrating their ability to assume the work without unnecessary delay and duplication of costs and effort.  See Government-Wide Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>Semiconductor Manufacturing Information and Pricing Data – 
U.S. Dept. of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), on the behalf of Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) plans to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with In-Stat, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc., 6909 E. Greenway Pkwy Ste 250, Scottsdale AZ 85254-2149 for the award of a contract under FAR part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This acquisition for Other Than Full and Open Competition is pursuant to the authority permitted under FAR subpart 6.302-1 (1) and 41. USC 253 (a) (1), “only responsible source and no other supplies of services will satisfy agency requirements”.

Statement of Work

Section 1 – Introduction/Background
BEA provides many economic measurements s part of the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPAs).  The NIPAs are used for a variety of purposes in setting national economic policy and in forecasting and interpreting macroeconomic activity.  They include gross domestic product (GDP), which is considered the most useful summary measure of the nation’s production.  BEA, as one of the world’s leading statistical agencies, collects source data, conducts research and analysis, develops and implements estimation methodologies and disseminates statistics to the public.

Section 2 – Statement of Objectives
The BEA is the nation’s economic accountant, producing measures such as GDP, one of the most important statistical releases for its effect on financial markets. The semiconductor industry is important for GDP estimates - where trade in semiconductor devices is one of the components - and for the industry accounts - the semiconductor industry is amoung industries with the highest value-added within manufacturing.  The objective of this procurement is to obtain data on the operations, including prices, costs and unit sales of microprocessor chips for a key producer in the industry:  Intel Corporation.  These data will be used to assess the deflator for the value of imports and exports of semiconductor devices.  These data must include a consistent set of data series for at least 10 years.

The procurement of quarterly data on Intel's prices, costs, and unit sales and adjustment of the semiconductor trade price indexes is important in assessing the accuracy of our GDP estimates.  The data must be quarterly, for highly granular product classes and must be available for at least 10 years.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis will use these data to construct an adjustment to our price deflators for imports and exports of semiconductor devices.  The following are the data requirements:
1. The data must be available quarterly
2. The time span covered must be 1993 - 2005
3. Data must be available for all of Intel's chips: desktop, mobile, and server.

a. List prices (as reported by Intel)
b. Prices adjusted for bulk discounts
c. Unit shipments
d. Manufacturing cost
e. Attributes of the chip (speed, cache, process, technology, and Intel chip family identifier).

Interested parties who believe they can meet the Agency’s requirement are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response; all responses must include detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements.  In your response you must address each of the items listed above in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement.  Failure to submit documentation will result in the agency proceeding as stated above.  A determination by the agency not to open competition is solely within the discretion of the agency.  In accordance with FAR 5.101 (a) (2) a written affirmative response must be received no later than 10 days after the publication of this posting (synopsis not required/price).

All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to the address contained in the header or via email to Diane.Trice@noaa.gov - to the attention of Diane Trice, and use reference # BA543200600086DT .

DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE 
AIR UNIVERSITY (AETC) 
MEMORANDUM FOR 42 CONS/LGCB 
FROM: AWC/DF 
SUBJECT: Sole Source Justification 
I. Description of the supplies and services being acquired: The Air War College, Directorate of Academic Affairs (AWC/DF) requests that the Ohio State University (OSU) Law School, Moritz College, provide the rights to an unpublished treatise on Negotiations Strategies and Planning Concepts to the Air War College. Upon completion, the treatise will be published by AWC and used as the textbook for in-residence core and elective courses; executive seminar sessions, outreach programs, and the non-residence course. These courses and programs will be taught during Academic Year 2006-2007 (AY07) that begins on 18 August 2006. The text is needed starting 1 September 2006. 
2. Justification for Sole Source: The AWC has been seeking a text for use in the resident Leadership and Ethics core course. It is also seeking these materials for application in an AY07 Negotiations Elective course as well as multiple offerings of an negotiations executive seminar as part of the AWC outreach program. Finally, the non-resident program is seeking materials for inclusion in parts of its AY07 curriculum. AWC discovered OSU has an unpublished treatise which is a comprehensive resource to support our courses for the following reasons: 
	a. The text approaches negotiations from several lenses. Of key importance, it discusses cultural aspects of negotiations, a Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) critical emphasis issue. 
	
	b. It incorporates the Interest-Based Negotiations (IBN) Model into other discussions on language, regional approaches, trust building and perceptions. IBN is the Air Force's negotiations framework and this integration into such a comprehensive list of topics is unique.

	 
	c. It contains a discussion on use of interpreters for negotiations. For an Air Expeditionary Forces (AEF)-oriented AF, this discussion is also critical.
	 
	d. The treatise addresses Authority, Power, and Stature from a military as well as regional culture framework. This is a unique treatment of the topic within the realm of negotiations. 

	
	e. The treatise addresses ethical considerations in negotiations, addressing a military perspective on the topic. This is also a unique treatment of the topic and essential for effective preparation for a military member when they negotiate. 
	
	f. The treatise addresses multi-party considerations and ties the complex world of negotiating within the bounds of previously set negotiations rules of engagement (from previous or existing agreements and treaties) to the current situation. 

	g. The OSU School of Law’s (Moritz College) academic and civilian credentials and experience are like no other. The Moritz College is a nationally ranked program and offers a Certificate in the emerging area of Dispute Resolution, as well as an exceptionally broad array of clinical programs, including mediation. The Center for Interdisciplinary Law and Policy Studies offers students the opportunity to work closely with faculty members from both the College of Law and other disciplines on research dealing with critical contemporary policy issues. Dean Rogers—Dean of Moritz College—has personally invested herself in the development and oversight of this treatise which is extremely unusual when considering the time constraints placed on most senior leader calendars. Dean Rogers is an exceptional practitioner and academician. She earned her Juris Doctorate from Yale Law School and has been a faculty member at Moritz since 1983. She is a nationally recognized scholar in the field of Alternative Dispute Resolution and was appointed by President Clinton to the Legal Services Corporation Board. Additionally, the College boasts five other faculty that have extensive expertise in Alternative Dispute Resolution, affording them a unique capability amongst America’s best Law Schools. 

3.  Justification that source is the only known source: After extensive research of the market on the literature in this category (completed a literature search at major university library sites, accomplished an Air University Library (AUL) bibliographylsearch engine matrix, and ran a broad search effort through Google to look at commercial/non-academic sources), this treatise is the only one of its kind that deals with and focuses on the concepts in such a comprehensive manner, utilizing the predominant and accepted cultural and negotiations models set against a military context. 
4.  Actions taken to preclude future sole source acquisitions: This information is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. No action can be taken to preclude future sole source acquisitions under the current conditions. Upon a change in the AWC and AU curriculum, another contractor may be able to fulfill this requirement negating the need for future sole source. 

5.  As the AWC Dean of Academic Affairs (DF), I am the point of contact and can be reached at XXX-XXXX.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

This synopsis is being prepared IAW FAR Part 5. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Additional information regarding the specifications for this DDS Signal Generator Model 1940A can be found at http://www.novatech-instr.com. JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: 1. Contracting Activity – Department of the Air Force, 37th Contracting Squadron LGCBD, 1655 Selfridge Avenue, Bldg 5450, Rm 206, Lackland AFB, TX 78236-5253. 2. Nature and/or description of action being processed- This will be a firm fixed-price contract for four Novatech Model 1940A/S-04 DDS Signal Generators exclusively manufactured and distributed by NOVATECH INSTRUMENTS, INC. 3. Description of the supplies/services required to meet the agency’s needs- 310th MI BN, Bldg 4552, 4553 Pike Rd, Ft Meade, MD 20755-5995 needs to purchase four DDS Signal Generators capable of producing four simultaneous RF outputs at frequencies and amplitudes necessary to drive simulators already in use for the purposes of training in the TEMPEST element. The specified DDS Signal Generators manufactured and distributed by NOVATECH are currently in use and make it necessary to purchase the additional items to maintain consistency in equipment. 4. Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition- 10 U.S.C. 2330 (b)(1)(ii) as amended by section 801 of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2002 and Federal Regulation (FAR) 8.404 and FAR 6.302-1. 5. Demonstration that Brand’s unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires the use of only one particular brand authority- Simulators purchased by the National Security Agency (NSA) for the TEMPEST Element training program require signal generators capable of producing four simultaneous outputs at frequencies and amplitudes sufficient to drive the simulators.  The DDS Signal Generators Model 1940A/S-04 manufactured and distributed by NOVATECH Inc are the only Signal Generators currently on the market capable of accomplishing this requirement. No other piece of equipment satisfactorily provides the capabilities of the NOVATECH Model 1940A/S-04 DDS Signal Generator. 6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable- NOVATECH is the only company that makes or distributes this signal generator. An internet search was conducted by both the end user and contracting specialist to locate companies capable of providing this item. The specifications for this signal generator were sent to more than one company specializing in signal generators. Of those companies who responded all indicated that that they did not have a product that could accomplish the same results at this time. 7. Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable- The contracting Officer shall determine the price offered to be fair and reasonable through one or more of the following: A. Comparison of proposed prices (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(i)) B. Comparison of previously proposed priced  and previous Government and commercial contract prices with current proposed prices for the same or similar items (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(ii)) C. Comparison with competitive published price lists, published market prices of commodities, similar indexes, and discount or rebate arrangements (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(iv)) D. Comparison of proposed prices with independent government cost estimates. (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(v)) E. Comparison of proposed prices with prices obtained through open market research for the same or similar items. (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(vi)) F. Analysis of pricing information provided by the offeror. (FAR 15.404-1(b)(2)(vii)) G. The CO’s personal knowledge of the item being purchased. 8. Description of the market research conducted and the results, or a statement of the reasons market research was not conducted- The 344 TRS TEMPEST Element conducted research to locate signal generators capable of providing the outputs required to drive the simulators purchased for the TEMPEST training element by the NSA. The contracting specialist assigned to this acquisition conducted market research on the internet and through the Small Business dynamic business search and found that there was no other company that produced a DDS Signal Generator capable of the same functions as specified by the NOVATECH DDS Signal Generators. NOVATECH Instruments Inc. is the only known source that can satisfy the government’s requirement. The cost of having another company develop or adapt a similar signal generator would be prohibitive. Other alternatives are cost prohibitive as well. This procurement is being synopsized IAW FAR Part 5. The anticipated award date is 1 Aug 06.  Delivery is expected six weeks after receipt of contract. The POC’s for this acquisition are: Terrie Seybold at 210-671-1755 or via e-mail at: terrie.seybold@lackland.af.mil or Ms. Anita L. Guadiano at 210-671-1772 or via e-mail at anita.guadiano@lackland.af.mil.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements. The Dell PowerEdge 1855 blade server was selected for this purpose because it must be used in a standardized Dell environment and because results obtained by the Bureau’s Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturer’s servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of State’s processing, redundancy, and management requirements. The PowerEdge 1855 has been approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ Configuration Control Board and is being added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which, in the interests of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration, has established an environment comprised solely of Dell HW.  The continued use of Dell servers obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple HW manufacturer’s server configurations or to manage multiple vendors’ out years support and maintenance agreements.    The PowerEdge 1855 blade servers offer space utilization and cost advantages over the 1 U servers they replace.  They will be deployed at a facility that is space constrained and thus the ability to deploy 10 blade servers in a chassis occupying only 7U of rack space is of special significance.   Unlike some other manufacturers’ blade servers, the 1855s offer the same functionality as can be obtained from 1 U servers, i.e., there is no trade-off between density and functionality. The Dell PowerEdge 1855 servers are to replace older equipment and must be delivered, installed, configured, tested and integrated in the production environment in time to go live prior to October 4, 2006, the initiation date of the 2008 Diversity Visa program. CA/CST therefore must take physical possession of this HW no later than September 1, 2006.   Even if another manufacturer’s server identical to the PowerEdge 1855 in terms of specifications, configuration and functionality were to become available at this juncture, it could not be evaluated and baselined in time to ensure that it would be requisitioned, competed, obtained, and otherwise readied for use by October 4, 2006.   Absolutely no slippage can be allowed in the initiation date of the 2008 Diverstiy Visa program that the PowerEdge 1855 will support.

<DESC>Clarification, the 100% nylon shorts are just generic nylon athletic shorts. However the t shirts are the Under Armor type. The last brand we got was Augusta Performance Moisture management. Depending on the manufacturer they call the material dry fit, dry weave, moisture wicking etc… I hope this helps.

<DESC>FA860406R7507 -Request for Statseeker Network Monitor

AMENDMENT: #2
This amendment changes #FA8604-06-R-7507 from sole source requirement to a small business set-aside for open competition.  

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Request for Quotation (RFQ) number is FA8604-06-R-7507.  This solicitation and incorporated clauses/provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-11, Effective 05 Jul 2006 and & Class Deviation 2005-o0001 and DFARS Current to Change Notice 20060616.  The solicitation incorporates by reference the following clauses: FAR 52.204-7, 52.212-1, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, 52.212-5, and DFARS 252.204-7004 - Alternate A, 252.212-7001, 252.227-7013, and 252.227-7014.  NAICS Code: 423430.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

The system will be to support a Unix computational environment.  The software will need to monitor 10,000 switch/router ports and collect and maintain a history of usage, state, and error statistics for each port.  Collection will need to be done over a low bandwidth link via the SNMP protocol.  The software must be able to handle different router and switch configurations, including manufacturer, type of switch, version of OS, and SNMP authentication strings.  No software can be loaded on the switches or routers.  The software requires the ability to sort the data by any collected statistic independent of the switch/router location. The software should also be able to export the data.  Access to the data must be via a web browser on a non-Microsoft machine via an SSL connection supporting the DoD CAC certificates as authentication. As a warning, Microsoft based solutions would be very difficult to support in the environment this will be utilized in.


EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS:

The Government will select the best overall offer, based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors and are described below.  All factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly more important that cost or price. Supportability and Price are equally weighed; however, the product proposed must be determined to be technically acceptable. 

1.	Technical Capability
2.	Supportability
3.	Price


1. Technical Capability:  This will be evaluated by the ability to fulfill the above requirements.  Pass/Fail


2. Supportability: The below sub-factors will be evaluated to determine supportability of proposed product. 
   a. Administration requirements of the machine
   b. Hardware requirements needed to support it
   c. Amount of customization needed to obtain the functionality
   d. Impact of additional support platforms

These will be given a rating of Excellent, Satisfactory, and Unsatisfactory depending on definitions below
	 
Excellent (BLUE)       Response meets all and exceeds some of the specified minimum performance or capability requirements in a way beneficial to the Air Force and has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased price, or degradation of performance.  Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.  
 	 
Satisfactory (GREEN)	Response meets all of the specified minimum performance or capability requirements and has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased price, or degradation of performance.  Special contractor effort and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.  
 	 
Unacceptable (RED)	Response fails to meet some specified minimum performance or capability requirements necessary for acceptable contract performance and is likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased price or d
