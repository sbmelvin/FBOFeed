<CONTACT>MARIE DAY PURCHASING AGENT 2083832228     MDAY@PN.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals.  The Bureau of Reclamation Snake River Area Office intends to issude a sole source contract with the Idaho Department of Fish & Game to reimburse IDFG for fish stocking at Arrowrock Reservoir. In April 2001, the Bureau of Reclamation, (Reclamation) Pacific Northwest Region completed a Final Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision for the rehabilitation of the Arrowrock dam outlet works.  In the Record of Decision, Reclamation committed to: ?reimburse Idaho Department of Fish and Game (IDFG) for restocking Arrowrock reservoir with 180,000 rainbow trout fingerlings, 140,000 rainbow trout catchables, and 77,500 kokanee fingerlings in the spring and summer following construction. Construction was completed in spring 2004.   The fish stocking agreed to for 2004 is a mitigation measure for impacts of the project and is supplemental to the annual stocking IDFG performs at Arrowrock reservoir IDFG is the state regulatory agency for fish and fishing in Idaho.  In addition IDFG operates a series of fish hatcheries that raise gamefish for stocking in certain streams and lakes in Idaho.  IDFG has regularly stocked kokanee and rainbow trout in Arrowrock Reservoir for a number of years.  IDFG and State fish hatcheries are uniquely qualified to provide gamefish for introduction into Idaho waters.  As the regulatory agency for fish and fishing in the state of Idaho, IDFG is the only entity authorized to stock fish in Idaho waters.  Even the stocking of fish in private ponds must be approved by IDFG.  IDFG operates a number of State fish hatcheries that meet the stringent State requirements for disease prevention.  IDFG hatcheries raise genetic strains that are disease resistant and fast growing based on many years of experience.  IDFG hatcheries annually supply kokanee and rainbow trout to Arrowrock Reservoir, although in lesser numbers.  The fish that Reclamation is paying for are over and above the normal annual stocking by IDFG. Parties who believe they are qualified to respond to this announcement may e-mail their firm's qualifications to the following address.  mday@pn.usbr.gov   No phone or fax inquiries will be allowed.

<DESC>SCOPE OF REQUIREMENT.  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) requires consumer credit bureau data for the purpose of conducting research on credit-risk modeling.  The OCC is interested in purchasing (1) Historical Data - a representative sample of consumer credit bureau histories for 500,000 to 1,500,000 individuals, going back at least 5 years (i.e., 1999 to present), on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis, and (2) Future Data - on the same representative sample in (1) above or new samples, reported on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis.  

The data must be provided in a raw, machine-readable form for use in a variety of computer software packages including but not limited to Microsoft Access, SAS, and STATA.

The data must be sortable to allow OCC to:  (1) track individual borrowers and, if possible, households, over time (i.e. a longitudinal or panel data design). The specific identity of the borrowers must be suppressed;   (2) track individual trade lines (i.e., lender) over time.  The name of the lender must be suppressed;   (3) provide a full list of bureau variables including, but not limited to, age of account (open/close dates), payment history for each trade line (current days past due, charge off, bankruptcy, etc), amount paid each period, amount past due, outstanding balances, credit limit (revolving credits), etc.  (4) identify, update and refresh the individual account and trade line information; and   (5) add additional individuals and trade lines to the sample so as to adequately represent the national population of credit histories.
 
The resultant contract's period of performance would be a base period, plus four option years.

HOW TO ACQUIRE A COPY OF THE SOLICITATION:   OCC anticipates issuing the solicitation in August, 2004, at www.fedbizopps.gov.   The solicitation will contain the details of the requirement, the instructions for submitting a quote, and how the quotes will be evaluated.  

This is NOT a small business set-aside.  It is a full and open competition using simplified acquisition procedures under the Commercial Item Test Program.  All responsible parties may submit a quote that will be considered by the OCC.  

NAICS Code:  518210, Data Processing, Hosting and Related Services - $21.0.
Service Code:  D317, Automated Data Services.

OCC anticipates awarding the contract in September 2004.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for Simulation Software Maintenance & Programming analysis support services in support of the Flight Systems Laboratory (FSL) Airspace Simulation and Analysis Tool (ASAT).  The ASAT system is proprietary to Air Traffic Simulation (ATS), 3317 Deer Valley, Edmond, OK, 73034.  The system is the primary simulation program in use today for the development of standards and criteria by the Flight Standards Service (AFS).  This system is used for development and implementation of extremely high fidelity computer simulations of specific aircraft and aircraft avionics such as Flight Management Systems (FMS) and Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS).  The Software system is based upon proprietary software and license from the developer ATS who owns the rights of the data and/or algorithms and/or computer software.  The FAA does not have the necessary technical data, and software codes to produce or procure this required software system on a competitive basis.  Air Traffic Simulations developed and owns the proprietary information and data based used on this system.  The systems has the ability to incorporate high fidelity computer models and empirically determined parameters into high speed Monte Carlo simulations of complex aviation scenarios, such as combinations of multiple parallel or converging approaches, missed approaches, and departures or incorporation of complex maneuvers on precision approach.  The simulations can then be run as many times as needed (from 10,000 runs to 1,000,000 or more) to adequately examine the full range of parameter combinations, allowing sensitivity analyses, critical parameter identification, and evaluation of risk levels.  The simulations may involve relatively simple straight-in precision approaches relying on complex multi aircraft, multi-maneuver operations such as Simultaneous Offset Instrument Approaches (SOIA).   The requirement is being processed using limitation of sources to a single source as provided for under the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Sections 3.2.2.2 and 3.2.2.4.  This software systems maintenance support is required from the vendor due to the proprietary nature of the software and its support requirements.  Any questions must be in writing to Brent D. Foreman, Contracting Officer, FAA, Aviation, Medical & Training Division, AMQ-310, P.O. Box 25082, Oklahoma City, OK 73125, Phone (405) 954-7894.  Reference DTFAAC-04-R-02085 no later than August 31, 2004

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to obtain technical assistance services in the area of agricultural and natural resource-based sectors.  The central roles of these sectors are combating hunger and poverty, and serving as an engine for sustainable market-led economic growth and prosperity. 
...............................................................................
USAID anticipates awarding five to six (5 - 6) indefinite quantity contracts (IQCs).  USAID anticipates awarding up to three to four (3-4) awards under full and open competition.  Also anticipated are up to one (1) small business set-aside award reserved for either a) a consortium led by a small business or b) a small business.  Finally, it is anticipated that there will be one (1) award set-aside for a consortium led by a small business or a small business which will have limited scope within the overall services to be provided under the RAISE PLUS IQC.  Specifically, the last award anticipated will be limited to providing services in design, evaluation, workshops and conferences....................................................................................

There is an expectation that many of the Task Orders submitted by USAID Missions under the IQCs will be very complex and demanding for any one firm to be able to provide all the required mix of skills.  Therefore, firms are encouraged to submit proposals in behalf of a consortium with one organization serving as the lead business.  Also encouraged are proposals from consortiums led by a small businesses..................................................................................................

There is an authorized sector ceiling of US$500 million for the RAISE PLUS activities over a five year period.  The aggregate ceiling will apply as follows;   US$480 million will serve as the aggregate ceiling for the four IQCs awarded to provide the full spectrum of services.  US$20 million will serve as the ceiling for the one small business award providing the aforementioned limited services.   The total amount for Task Orders issued under the resulting RAISE PLUS related IQCs may not exceed their respective ceilings...............................................................................................

Note: There is no guarantee on the number of contracts awarded, the number of Task Orders, or amount of business  that any one firm will receive beyond the minimum stated in the RFP.  
Also Note:  The FY 2002 Appropriations Act contains new authority that allows Task Orders to be awarded to small and small disadvantaged businesses (i.e., firms who have been awarded a contract) without providing a fair opportunity to all contractors under a multiple award IQC.  The new authority applies to multiple-award IQC's that are initially funded with FY 2002 money.
................................................................................................. 
The RAISE PLUS IQC has been designed to be a broad, multi-faceted field support mechanism that will provide both short-term and long-term assistance.  It will help to identify and nurture the systemic shifts needed to create a more competitive, prosperous and sustainable agricultural and rural sector.  It will respond to the needs of various agricultural and natural resource-based sub-sectors, such as crops, livestock, forests, fisheries, tourism, wildlife, and agricultural related businesses.  It will respond to a range of agricultural and natural resource sector issues including: 1) sector strategies and program development; 2) trade strategy development; 3) broad policy analysis; 4) input market systems; 5) sustainable production; 6) post-harvest storage and processing; 7) product market systems; and 8) producer organization and enterprise development.

FAR 52.217-8 AND 52.217-9 Option to extend contract.   The government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and price-related factors. Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation – Commercial Items, applies with paragraph (a) completed as follows: Award will be made to the offeror that meets the solicitation’s minimum criteria for technical acceptability at the lowest price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers. (Factor 1) To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must furnish product literature that demonstrates the products offered meet all requirements stated in the above purchase descriptions for Line Items 0001.  (Factor 2) Past Performance, contractors to submit previous three (3) contract numbers, names of agencies/companies and contacts for past three years.  (Factor 3) price  Offerors’ proposals will be evaluated first under factor 1 above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award. See paragraph b below. Only those offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor 1 will be further evaluated under Factors 2 and 3.  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor 1 to be technically acceptable., Factor 2 is approximately equal to Factor 3, price. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror’s best terms from both a price and technical standpoint. (b) Technical capability of proposed item to meet the requirement, Factor 1, will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, instructions to offerors – commercial items, subparagraph (b) 4 which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors’ technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors’ technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technical unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically  unacceptable may not be considered further for award. © Offeror’s Past Performance information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, instructions to Offerors – Commercial items, Subparagraph (6) 10, will be used  to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  Past Performance information should be provided on the form provided as in attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any offeror’s proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror’s past performance as follows: Neutral:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. Outstanding:  No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degration of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror’s past performance. Satisfactory:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror’s past performance. Marginal:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror’s past performance. (d) Options:  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (e) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (of part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of  withdrawal is received before award.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  This requirement supports the United States Naval Test Pilot School (USNTPS) onboard the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, Maryland.  It is anticipated a purchase order priced on a time-and-materials basis will be awarded for this effort.  Award of this requirement is anticipated on or before 30 September 2004 to ensure no break in services occurs upon expiration of current Purchase Order N00421-04-P-0076.  This requirement is being procured under statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition, 10 USC Section 2304(c)(1), only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Contracting Office (NAVFACCO) Port Hueneme, CA 93043 intends to award on a Sole Source basis to Sustainable Resources Group Intnl., Inc. (SRGII), Honolulu, HI 96826-2114 for this requirement to reduce brushfire and erosion risks at Ulupa’u Crater, Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii.  For the Brushfire Risk Reduction Project Component, SRGII is the only responsible source because as the original designer of the water canons for this project they are required to independently oversee and evaluate the “test fire” of these water cannons prior to turnover of the installed water cannons to the government.  And for the Erosion Risk Reduction Project Component SRGII is the only responsible source to perform this project as follow-on to purchase N47408-02-P-6639.  SRGII has intimate knowledge and on-site experience and history in the project area.  Having SRGII build on their earlier effort (in this explosives ordnance impact area) to come up with quick solutions urgently needed avoids delay and substantial duplication of cost in orienting a new contractor to the area.  This procurement is being issued using the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), FAR Part 13. See Numbered Notes 22.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute (NCI),  Surveillance Research Program (SRP), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) plans to procure on a sole source basis, services for Modification and Validation of Birth Cohort Lifetables for all Causes Other than Lung Cancer by Smoking Status with, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Bursars Office, 750 University Avenue, Madison, WI  53706.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) consists of a group of NCI-sponsored investigators using various modeling techniques and approaches to assess the impact of cancer control interventions (e.g., prevention, screening, treatment) on population trends in incidence and mortality.  The purpose of this contract is create birth cohort life tables for all causes of death other then lung cancer as a function of smoking status for use as a common input into the CISNET lung cancer models.  Initial work had begun to construct tables removing lung cancer as a cause of death for white males.  Developing lifetables for all causes other than lung cancer is more complicated than lifetables for all causes other than breast, prostate or colorectal cancer.  This is due to the fact that mortality from all causes other than lung cancer is highly dependent on smoking history.  All of the CISNET lung models are run conditional on a smoking history.  Given a person's smoking history, it is reasonable to assume that mortality from lung cancer and all causes other than lung cancer are independent.  The University of Wisconsin-Madison is the only source known to the NCI that is uniquely qualified to perform the services required.   This project shall be completed by Marjorie Rosenberg, PhD, FSA, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Her research interests are in the application of statistical methods to health care, and applying her actuarial expertise to cost and policy issues in health care.  She has developed statistical tools that can monitor health care outcome processes and is involved in the development of models to be used in cost-effectiveness analyses to compare the merits of alternative treatments or interventions.  Dr. Rosenberg is also a member of the NCI collaborative agreement, CISNET.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, August 31, 2004.  If you have questions, they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  Solicitation number NCI-40140-NG must be stated on all correspondence.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for NX Client Software. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the software from Xerox as the only known source that can satisfy Agency requirements. The NX software package developed by Xerox is the only known software that provides the functionality required to collaborate with NASA Ames and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the Knowledge Management and Disaster Recovery pilot project. It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer a similar software package that would meet this requirement, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 1, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Budgetary and Procurement Support Services for the Systems Management Office for an estimated period of performance of 4 months. NASA/MSFC intends to negotiate with System Studies and Simulation, Inc. (S3), 615 Discovery Drive, Huntsville, AL 35806, pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), since the acquistion of these services are deemed to be reasonably available from this source only. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  The proposed procurement is a follow-on effort to that currently being provided by S3 under Contract H-33957D.  MSFC plans to extend this contract for four months through January 20, 2005.  S3 has provided these services since June 20, 2001.	S3 has unique capabilities in that S3 personnel currently providing this support have demonstrated they have the requisite knowledge, skills, expertise, and experience to efficiently and effectively satisfy the Government’s requirements.  The proposed effort requires the use of personnel who have a high degree of knowledge, skills, and experience with MSFC’s Integrated Financial Management/SAP system as well as MSFC’s processes and procedures associated with budgets and procurement.  2.  S3 is uniquely situated in that it is capable of continuing to provide the proposed support over the four-month period of performance without any adverse impacts such as disruptions in service, decreases in productivity due to learning curves, etc., that are typically associated with transitioning from an incumbent contractor to a new contractor. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Monica C. Williams not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 1, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) invites you to submit a proposal for small class expendable launch vehicle services to be provided under the NASA Launch Services (NLS) contract.  The original NASA Launch Services (NLS) RFP was issued on October 18, 1999, resulting in the award of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contracts to Boeing Delta Launch Services, Inc. and Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services, Inc.  The original solicitation remains open until June 30, 2010 through the use of an innovative on-ramp provision found in Section C, Clause 2.0.   On a semi-annual basis, NASA invites new, emerging domestic launch service providers that meet the minimum contract requirements and current contract holders who wish to on-ramp new launch services to submit proposals during an open season.  The open season for proposal submission is the entire month of February and August of each calendar year.	 The synopsis notice posted on February 6, 2004 for the February 2004 open season included a notice that NASA anticipated the issuance of a separate synopsis for expansion of the NLS performance range to include small class expendable launch vehicle services.   Pursuant to that notice, this synopsis invites current NLS contract holders and new emerging domestic launch providers that meet the minimum contract requirements for small class launch vehicle services to submit on-ramp proposals to NASA in accordance with the instructions in this notice.   This performance range expansion is consistent with RFP Section C, Clause 2.3, “Expansion of Performance Capabilities”.  Minimum NLS launch capabilities are generally described in the solicitation as the capability to deliver a 1500kg payload to orbit at an altitude of 200km and a launch inclination of 28.5 degrees.   The solicitation is being amended in accordance with Section C, Clause 2.3 to expand the performance range capabilities by reducing the minimum payload delivery capability from 1500kg to  250kg, with altitude and inclination as referenced above.   On or about March 22, 2004, the revised solicitation will be released as RFP 10-00-0021, Revision 1.  Upon release, an open season for small class expendable launch vehicle services proposals will commence, with proposals due 60 days from the date Revision 1 is issued.   During this open season, NASA will entertain proposals for small class launch services, defined as those launch services for payloads between the amended minimum capability (250kg) and the previous NLS minimum capability (1500kg).   Future NLS open seasons will invite proposals for the full range of NLS performance, including medium/heavy capability as well as the newly added small class capability.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate for the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, located in Cincinnati, OH, on a sole source basis with the Ohio State University Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering for a study entitled "Life Cycle Assessment of the Use of Ionic Liquids versus Traditional Solvents for Chemical Processes." Over the past decade, there is growing research and development work on the use of alternative solvents industrial reaction-separation processes as way to reduce pollution and increase yield.  Most organic solvents can cause  either air emission or water contamination problems.  Over the past few years, there has been increasing interest and excitement in ionic liquids, molten salts, due to their potentially useful applications in organic, inorganic and bioinorganic transformations.  This is mainly because of several  favorable attributes such as non-flammable and non-volatile character, and relative ease of preparation.  Ionic liquids have been shown to be useful for liquid-liquid extraction, as reaction media, catalysis, and electrochemistry. They have shown to enhance the overall activity and selectivity of  chemical processes and many are stable up to 200 oC giving wide range of kinetic control.   Although, there is a lot of work done on the use ionic liquid as a reaction medium and a full analysis of the use of IL is still lacking.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wants to conduct a  complete feasibility assessment on the use of ionic liquids for industrial processes.  Life cycle analysis will be conducted on the process that includes the synthesis of ionic liquids and the purification steps, their use for chemical reaction medium, the recovery of reaction products and  catalysts from the ionic liquids, and the recycling of ionic liquids will be assessed.  Although, much of the current research is primarily aimed at discovery the prospect of these liquids is vast and more work is needed to understand the loss, stability, regeneration that are critical for viable  commercial application. The US Environmental Protection Agency intends to conduct a study on how the use of ionic liquid compares with standard molecular solvents based on function, toxicity, environmental impacts, and costs.  Specifically, the Ohio State University Department of Chemical and  Biomolecular Engineering shall:  Task 1	Literature Search. The contractor shall make extensive search of the literature to identify relevant research and sources of data.  The search includes studies on specific aspects of the life cycle, manufacturing processes, toxicity, stability, environmental  fate and migration, interaction and hazard, reactivity etc. Task 2	Selection of Typical Ionic Liquid and its Life Cycle.  Based on the literature search and input from EPA researchers, the contractor shall select a typical ionic liquid for the detail study, along with an alternative standard  molecular solvent. The detail goals of the study will be identified to asses the potential benefit of ionic liquids for commercial process using life cycle assessment study.   Task 3	Obtaining Life Cycle Inventory Data. For all the processes selected in Task 2, the contract will obtain data about  material and energy inputs, emissions, exposure potential, human health and environmental impacts of ionic liquids and potential breakdown of products from existing databases, literature and laboratory data.  Task 4	Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP)  Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP)  The  contractor shall comply with all the requirements as delineated on the "Quality Assurance Planning Requirements Form."  The contractor shall prepare a quality assurance project plan (QAPP) document that describes the necessary assurance and control in the quality of the data gathered for the  analysis.  Task 5	Impact Assessment The contractor shall use life cycle inventory data for assessing the impact of the ionic liquids versus conventional molecular solvents. Standard methods from ISO 14000, as well as advanced thermodynamic methods that the contractor develops will be used for the  impact assessment.  Uncertainty bounds on the results will also be estimated. Task 6	Hybrid LCA The error introduced due to selection of only some processes in Task 2 will be reduced by considering information at coarser scales of the economy and ecosystems.  The contractor uses novel approach for  such a thermodynamic hybrid approaches. Task 7	Decision Analysis The contractor shall use the results of the hybrid approach for comparing the ionic liquids and molecular solvents, and used to guide decision making.  This will help in determining whether ionic liquids are really superior from a  life cycle environmental point of view and to set directions for future research. This notice is not a request for quotations. EPA source research indicates the Ohio State University Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering is the only known source  able to satisfy the government's  requirements. What is unique about Ohio State University's approach is that it (a) uses thermodynamics for the analysis to ensure satisfaction of the laws of nature, (b) accounts for the contribution of ecosystem goods and services or natural capital, which is essential for evaluating  sustainability, (c) uses detailed chemical engineering process models based on the latest simulation tools and literature.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical  documentation to establish the potential of fulfilling the government's  requirements. Any such  documentation must be submitted within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice (before  Wednesday September 1, 2004 at 12:00 PM EST).   A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order  based  upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of  the Government.  Information  received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a  competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being  processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The applicable NAICS code  is 541710.

Currently, the EPA is involved in the execution of laboratory studies within the Fluid Modeling Facility's (FMF) Meteorological Wind Tunnel, to develop data bases that can be used, specifically, to generate near and mid-range concentrations of pollutants emitted within complex urban settings and, generally, to compare velocity  fields and concentration fields against those estimated by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)  models.  The facility is a complex system of computer-controlled instrumentation that is designed and delicately balanced to satisfy the requirements of laboratory fluid modeling studies of atmospheric phenomena.  Specifically, the wind-tunnel experiments  involve a study of flow and dispersion in  highly complex and urbanized areas.  NAICS Code 541710 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The Request for Quote (RFQ) is expected to be issued approximately fifteen days after the date this notice is posted.  Quotes will be due approximately 15 calendar days after  issuance of the RFQ.  This quote will be awarded as a result of a small business set-aside simplified acquisition with Full and Open Competition.  The RFQ and amendments will be available via the Internet  http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  It will be your responsibility to frequently check the same  site where the solicitation is posted for any amendments.  Telephone and fax request will not be honored.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality through the Program Support Center, plans to award a 9-month sole source simplified acquisition to School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) University of Sheffield, Principle Investigator, Chris McCabe, Ph.d., 85 Wilkinson Street, Sheffield, S102GJ. Dr. McCabe was the principal investigator of a cost-effectiveness analysis of the four disease-modifying therapies for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) funded by National Institute of Clinical Excellence ( NICE).  NICE works on behalf of the UK’s National Health Service to make recommendations on treatment and care using the best available evidence. The contractor shall have no conflicts of interest that might influence the outcome of the cost-effectiveness study. To the best of the knowledge of CMS, no other cost-effectiveness model exists for the treatment of MS that was built on long-term natural history of the disease, incorporates the results of a recent systematic review, utilized state-of-the-art probabilistic sensitivity analyses, incorporates robust utility measures and was not funded by industry.  The purpose of this requirement is to provide a cost-effectiveness model of disease-modifying therapies for the treatment of MS. The final report provided under this requirement will be used to inform the evaluation of the demonstration project that will pay for self-administered drugs and biologicals prescribed as replacements for drugs currently covered under Medicare Part B. The contractor shall work with AHRQ staff to ensure that the cost-effectiveness methods used are consistent with standards set by the US Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine. The contractor shall use state-of-the art stochastic methods to model the underlying uncertainty of the cost-effectiveness measures.  The contractor should keep in mind that this study will help set the standards for the conduct of future cost-effectiveness analyses within CMS.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  The Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), the Test and Evaluation/Science and Technology Spectrum Efficient Technology Program Office, Edwards AFB, CA, is seeking sources with demonstrated expertise and experience to design and build a working prototype of the Space-Time Decoder System.  The Government requests industry qualification packages, which include references and proof of capability and experience in the area of Space Time Decoder Systems.  The package will not exceed 10 pages.  Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way, or solicit offers from all responsible sources.  The Government will consider all responses to determine the extent of interest of qualified sources.  Industry must submit sufficient information for the Government to determine their capabilities and experience to design and build a working prototype of the Space-Time Decoder System.  The necessary steps for building the decoder include:  finalizing the signal processing algorithms (ARTM Tier I Space Time Block Codes) used in the detector; developing and assembling the preliminary hardware design for the decoder; conducting initial integration testing; and performing algorithm architecture trade-offs.  The proposed work is part of an ongoing research effort towards the establishment of Space Time Coding data encoding and processing technique and prototype demodulator designed to be incorporated into the Telemetry Receive Station to improve link reliability.  The research efforts have focused on two main phases, which are interrelated to each other:  (1) Design of an ARTM Tier I Space Time Block Code for Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) with demonstrated reduction in signal loss.  (2) Design of an ARTM Tier I Space Time Block Code for constant envelope offset QPSK, also demonstrating reduction in signal loss.  
Screening Criteria for Qualification Packages are:  Extensive knowledge of Space Time Coding algorithms applicable to aeronautical telemetry; experience with ARTM Tier I Space Time Block Code with the knowledge and ability to modify the code within allotted schedule; ability to provide engineering data packages to commercial vendors for product development and commercialization; proof of a Tier 1 compatibility Alamouti like code.
Any company proprietary information shall be separately marked.  Responses shall be single spaced, single sided and shall be submitted in two copies.  Drawings, diagrams, or figures may be provided as an attachment to the response to clarify stated capabilities.

(D) In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this RFQ.  (E) If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have an exceptional performance risk rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point.  Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.  (F) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance risk rating of “very good” or lower.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information contained in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and a written solicitation WILL NOT be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the September 2001 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 97-27. This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541512 with a small business size standard of $21.0 million.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mr. J. Emmett Ward, Brookeville, Maryland, to provide expert technical services to the NIH Business System (NBS) Project. These services are related specifically to technical and related administration issues and activities on the NBS project.  NIH previously completed a comprehensive management and systems analysis to define the requirements for a new administrative computing system and evaluated potential systems to satisfy these requirements. The analysis determined that the NIH must replace its current system with an off-the-shelf software product. As part of this implementation, NIH has engaged the services of numerous functional specialists to help design and configure the software to suit NIH needs. NIH is seeking the assistance from an individual with a detailed understanding of NIH technical and administrative systems, particularly with the Administrative Data Base (ADB).  NIH requires the detailed technical services to support the NBS project for a base period of 6 months with two 6 month option periods. Specifically, the contractor shall support the NBS Project Manager in the following areas: 1) Participating in the balanced scorecard evaluation approach, with specific attention to the project monitoring level, for the NBS implementation phase; 2)  Providing technical and programmatic support in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of functional team objectives as well as review methodology specifically checking the System Integrator’s adherence to the Project Plan and overall schedule; 3) Performing policy and issue analyses for the NBS Project on a myriad of topics as assigned by the Project Manager. Following these analyses, the contractor prepares draft policy documents/memoranda/reports/presentations for NBS review. 
Mr. Ward has provided technical services for the NBS project since January 14, 2002. During that time, he has provided services in an exceptional manner. Prior Mr. Ward was employed with the National Institutes of Health for over 30 years as a Government employee. Mr. Ward's previous experience as a technical expert with NIH Center for Information Technology (CIT) uniquely qualifies him as the only source capable of successfully providing the necessary technical services. This requirement represents a continuation of the services he is currently providing to the NBS project.  He therefore will require no orientation to NIH technical and related administrative issues. He has an extensive knowledge of NIH technical and administrative systems, particularly with the Administrative Data Base (ADB).

Mr. Ward has vast technical knowledge of the type required by the NBS project. NIH has determined that Mr. Ward is the only source with the unique combination of required expertise and experience who can successfully complete the requirements listed above. This notice of intent is not a Request for Competitive Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, NIH will consider all proposals received within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis. All capabilities statements received in response to this notice will be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria:  1) Expert knowledge of NIH technical and administrative systems, particularly with the Administrative Data Base (ADB) – 35%; 2) Experience in balance scorecard evaluation – 5%; 3) Experience and knowledge in designing and implementing a new enterprise system – 50%; 4) Experience in data analysis, writing policies and conduct presentations to higher level-officials – 10%. The contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, executive orders, rules and regulations applicable to its performance under this order. Full text of clauses and provisions are available at Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR): http://www.arnet.qov/far/. The following clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition and may be obtained from the web sites: 52.212-1, instructions to Offerers-Commercial Items (JAN 2004), FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (OCT 2003), FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders—Commercial Items (JUN 2004).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

These selected vendors will then have 45 days to make minor changes and deliver to WSMR the imager for full field testing and evaluation by 11/1/04. The ultimate goal is to select the best digital imager and award a multi-year requirement contract for 4 to 75 cameras in the first year.

<SUBJECT>R -- Cervical Cancer Expert Panel
<SOLNBR>11043
<RESPDATE>082304
<ARCHDATE>09072004
<CONTACT>Lenore Mickle, Contract+Specialist, Phone 770-488-2623, Fax 770-488-2847, Email LMickle@CDC.GOV
<DESC>This modification to 11043 is issued to provide answers to questions submitted from prospective offerers:
Q1.  Please clarify the signature requirements for electronic proposal submission.
A1.  If you have a scanner that allows you to send a PDF copy of your proposal, then this is acceptable for timely submission. Nonetheless, we require that you send a hard copy with the original signature as a follow up. I would expect to receive the hard copy within 4 business days, depending on the mail service utilized.  (The same applies to faxed proposals.)
Q2.  Can the program give any idea about how many experts they expect for the two in person conferences for cervical and breast cancer expert panels?
A2.  Approximately 25 experts are anticipated to participate on each panel, respectively. 
Q3.  Is the contractor required to pay for and arrange travel for the stakeholders for the two in person meetings? 
A3.  No, travel will be paid for by CDC and meeting logistics will be handled by another contractor.
Q4.  Can CDC provide a range of funding available for this task? This is pretty typical on task orders such as PICs and it would be helpful to have some idea (a range) of funds CDC expects to pay for this work?
A4.  Posted requirements for services under Simplified Acquisition procedures fall within the range of $25,000 to $100,000.
Q5.  Can a small business concern subcontract work to another firm; does this mechanism allow the subcontractor to not be a small business?
A5:  This is allowed and does not restrict the subcontractor as a small business.  Please note the particulars of the relevant clause:  Federal Acquisition Regulation Clause 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting "(b) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for (1) SERVICES (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern."   In short, you must do 50 percent of the work yourself and this portion of the work should be clearly shown on your proposal. 
Q6.  The time line seems quite compressed, is there a national stakeholders meeting planned for April or May for which they need the research findings?
A6.  Yes, the joint NBCCEDP/CCC/NPCR meeting is scheduled to be held some time in May.  The CDC requires the final reports finished to permit time to synthesize the findings for final policy determination to be reported by Feb. 25th and April 10th.
Q7.  Who are/is the technical monitor(s) of this program?  What is their job?
A7.  Nikki Hayes will serve as the technical monitor for the cervical cancer screening policies expert panel and April Vance will be the technical monitor for the breast cancer screening expert panel. They will provide general oversight and guidance related to the respective expert panels. Both are Public Health Advisors within the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control.***

3.    How will the Dual-Xeon slaves (1U) communicate with the host (4U)?  We are assuming GigE    
(1000BT).  Is this to be a single or dual LAN connection?   ANSWER:  Duel  10/100/1000 

4.   What is the delivery date to be?  This will determine the Cluster software to be used. ANSWER:  Delivery date Should be NLT 1 Oct 04.  

5. What power will be available for this rack (110vac and/or 220vac)? 
  ANSWER:  110 VAC

6. How long with the UPS need to keep the rack of systems up without external power?  Will the UPS need to report and control the graceful shutdown of the systems if that time limit is exceeded?  ANSWER:  We would like the UPS to control the graceful shutdown of the cluster.  Minimum 5 minutes Uptime needed.

7.  Are the hardware requirements “meet or exceed” because of the constant new product announcement and product obsolescence cycle?  ANSWER:  Correct.  We want the latest equipment to include the ability for scalability and flexibility in future years.

8. What is the application of the system(s), or cluster?  ANSWER:  The execution and processing of customer models and simulations.

9. Will filler panels be required to fill in the empty slots in the rack?  ANSWER:  No.

10. Will the keyboard and mouse be mounted IN the rack, or will they be used externally to the rack?  Will a monitor (display) be used, and will this be external to the rack to be provided?   ANSWER:  External to Rack with a 21” Flat Screen. 

11.  What are you trying to Cluster on your pc’s that you listed in this solicitation, Data , Exchange (email) or etc?  ANSWER:  The execution and processing of customer models and simulations. (DATA)
No outside connectivity available.

      4) Is there any off the shelf software that will be used?  Does it require specific clustering software?  ANSWER:  The specific commercial off-the-shelf clustering software will be SuSE Linux.

15. All clusters normally use a high speed switch for the MPI.  We can assume the interface will be 1000BaseT Ethernet, but no switch and CAT5E cables are called out in the list of requirements.  Is the switch GFE or is the vendor expected to furnish the switch?  ANSWER:  Vendor is expected to supply two 10/100/1000 Gbit Ethernet Smart Managed switches, and all Cables Cat-6, etc. to complete installation.  Vendor furnishes the switch.

16. Item 3b on previous revisions referred to hardware as 20amp power strip, but Mod 4 now calls for “UPS systems” which normally would imply an Uninterruptible Power Supply(s)” should be furnished.  If only the same 20A power strips are required, this would be a Power Distribution System (PDS) and not UPS.  UPS system can be supplied but there is a significant difference in cost and UPS would need to be designated to an unstated power off run time objective.  A two-strip PDS is probably what is needed – pls confirm.   ANSWER:  Vendor is to supply Rack Mounted Smart UPS with sufficient power to allow for at least a 5 minute clean shutdown.  Power strips will be supplied as required by the vendor.

17. Training requirements per Item 5.  Need to clarify training requirements. ANSWER:  Vendor will provide orientation on the cluster management software and hardware.  See paragraph 5.

18. Referring to Items 3c and 3d:  Are they to be managed switches?  Item 3c only comes managed, but 3d can have unmanaged and they are much less.  I am assuming they should be 24 ports due to the equipment installed in the rack and the Ethernet switch should be 10/100.  I also assume these switches should be rack-mounted. 
ANSWER:  Vendor will provide (2) twenty four port 10/100/1000 GB Smart Managed Ethernet Switches and all necessary cabling to complete installation.

19. Item 4b asks about GNU scientific compilers.  Is there any expanded information on this?  SuSE comes with GNU compilers, but I just wanted to make sure I was not missing some type requirement.   ANSWER:  The GNU compilers that come with SuSE should be sufficient.

20. Item 4a cluster management software and 4c CD burning software on the master node.  These items are included with SuSE 8 enterprise.  Are they looking for another product than what is supplied by the operating system.   ANSWER:  As long as the SuSE software works, should be fine.

21. Item 3a asks for a 44U rack cabinet with side panels.  Are there not to be any doors on the front and back?  Also, is 44U the max height, or can it be little taller?  I have been working on a rack that has doors and a cooling fan on top.  Is that why the doors are omitted, because cooling with come from the lack of doors?  Are the side panels allowed to be removable?  ANSWER:  Removable side panels are okay.  Doors omitted from front and back were for cooling purposes.  44U is the Max Height for the room.

22. Need to know the voltage ratings of the UPS in Para #3.  ANSWER:  Voltage Rating  120V UPS.  Rack Mounted.

23.  Do we want a beowolf cluster?  ANSWER:  Yes.

24.  Do we want to use open source only?  ANSWER:  Yes

25.  Fortran 77?  Or newer Fortran compiler (which menas something in addition to the GCC)?  ANSWER:  No Fortran needed.

<DESC>Amendment 01 has been issued. 

Federal Technology Service, Technical Services Division is releasing a FINAL Request for Proposal for Information Technology Engineering, Scientific, Technical and Analytical Services.  Services under this requirement may include development of new technology to support existing functionality; all phases of system engineering (including reverse engineering of conceptual designs); component development of new hardware and software; security/information assurance for systems,  networks, hardware, software and firmware components; cryptographic development & validation; limited hardware/software/firmware support; and training.  These services are in support of Fleet Numerical Meteorology & Oceanography Center (FNMOC) located in Monterey, CA.   FNMOC is responsible for around-the-clock operational meteorological and oceanographic support to the U.S. Navy, other U.S. Government agencies, and elements of the armed forces of allied nations providing numerical environmental global forecast models for ships, aircraft, and other forces throughout DOD.  FNMOC is DOD's principle operations processing center for automated numerical, meteorological and oceanographic analysis and prediction and has been designated the ForceNet Development Node.  This requirement will support the ForceNet concept for the U.S Navy.  ForceNet is defined as "the operational construct and architectural framework for naval warfare in the information age that integrates warriors, sensors, networks, command and control, platforms, and weapons into a networked, distributed combat force that is scalable across all levels of conflict from seabed to space and sea to land."   ForceNet implements the theory of network-centric warfare.

This procurement is being conducted using a multiple award, indefinite delivery/ indefinite quantity (IDIQ) approach.  Award of the basic IDIQ contract will enable firms to compete for individual task orders over the life of the contract.  We anticipate award of the basic contract will be made to those firms offering the overall "best-value."  

The contract is planned to be for a twenty-four (24) month base period, plus three (3), twelve (12) month options, and incorporate multiple pricing methods (Fixed Price/Labor Hour/Time & Materials & Cost reimbursable.)  The estimated value of work is $20 million for each year.  Offeror's may be required to possess security clearances up to Top Secret.     


This is a FINAL RFP based on the draft version issued under GS10T04ECD02. This solicitation is considered "Open Continuous", Offers submitted on or before August 24, 2004 (9:00 a.m. local time) will be included in the first group, and those received on or before August 31, 2004 (9:00 a.m. local time) will become the second group. These two groups will be included in the intial round of proposal evaluation and awards. All other proposals received (after group 1 & 2) will be evaluated quarterly based upon receipt of the proposal on or before the last working day of each quarter (Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec.)

All questions/comments regarding this Final RFP should be provided in writing to Sharon Blair, Contract Specialist @ Sharon.blair@gsa.gov on or before August 20, 2004.

The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), unique source.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  Interested parties may identify their interest and submit specific written technical data, including but not limited to resumes, management experience and other pertinent information, which will be used to determine the competence of firms other than EDS to successfully perform the required services.  A determination not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this notice.

<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 016 (17 AUG 04)-RFI Questions-Prime Contractors 1.  Based upon your previous response to the PRV RFI and the current production  air vehicle that you have used as your PRV baseline, identify all PRV ORD KPPs  and thresholds that this baseline air vehicle (a.) can meet today; and (b.)  will meet by Jan 06. If any KPPs and/or thresholds that cannot be fully met,  identify the capability that can be provided.  2.  Identify which version of your current production you used as your baseline  air vehicle.  Provide your response NLT 19 Aug 04 at 1600 EST. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 015 (5 AUG 04)-Hoist Requirements In response to a question concerning additional hoist requirements, the  Government provides the following response: At this time, we have no additional specification requirements other than the  ORD requirement for a hoist to conduct PRV missions.  Performance requirements  for PRV subsystems, such as the hoist, shall be generated by the Prime  Contractor after a PRV contract award. The PRV System Program Office will not  prepare subsystem requirement documents at any time. It is recommended that potential suppliers of PRV subsystems contact potential  Prime Integration PRV companies for information and integration at the  subsystem level. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 014 (27 Jul 04)-Program Office Estimate The Air Force team is working on a program office estimate (POE) for the  Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  The POE team is chartered to develop an  estimate by work breakdown structure (WBS) for SDD, production and O+S for a  fleet of 130 aircraft. The team is lead by the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) cost staff and includes members of the PRV program office. The POE will be  establish as a cost guide for future PRV administrative hurdles including the  source selection process and MS B DAB review.    As a crucial POE building block for PRV presentations to DOD and AF review  boards, we would like to have actual cost from recently completed helicopter  programs as a starting point. We request that each participating RFI contractor  submit actual cost/price info from a recent sale of the proposed helicopter.  This info should justify the WBS level 3 information which you have previously  submitted. We are particularly interested in separating recurring and non- recurring airframe, engines, avionics and mission equipment for the development  and production portions of the program. Production weight of the airframe  should be included. Also, the information should be phased by year and  associated quantities (see below table).   	 	200X	 	200X	 	200X	 	200X  	      N/R    Rec     N/R    Rec	     N/R    Rec	      N/R   Rec Development	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Qty	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Airframe	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Engine 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Avionics	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Mission 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Production	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Qty	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Airframe	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Engine 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Avionics	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Mission 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Since some late summer acquisition briefings (Courses of Action) are required  we would like to have the information by 15 Aug 04 to incorporate into the POE.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 006 (31 Mar 04)- Sikorsky Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Sikorsky plans to  brief the SPO on 14 April at 15:00 for about 1hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 005 (22 Mar 04)- Team 101 Briefing In response to questions during the one-on-on sessions between Prime  Contractors and the ASC/LUH at the 4 March Industry Day, Lockheed Team 101  plans to brief the SPO on 13 April at 10:00 for about 1 hour. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDEMENT 004 (19 Mar 04)- Questions and Answers The following questions were submitted to the government.  All questions and  answers have been cleared through the Public Affairs office. 1.  Question:  Could you give a brief description of the areas that are not  currently met by the existing fleet of helicopters now or in the expected  future that are driving the need for a new platform? Answer:  Current deficiencies are: -Service Life.  The HH-60G is approaching the end of its useful service life. -Survivability.  Insufficient survivability (susceptibility and vulnerability)  to ensure mission success against the Defense Planning Guidance (DPG) validated  threat environment. This includes a limited electronic warfare suite,  insufficient defensive armament for suppression of air and ground threats, and  inadequate protection from small arms fire -Range / Combat radius. Aircraft and rotor system design limit unrefueled  combat radius.  In certain theaters, these characteristics do not meet  Combatant Commanders mission requirements for mission execution. -Payload capacity / Cabin volume. Extremely limited cabin space for stowage and  employment of mission equipment and crew served weapons, infiltration of  Recovery Teams, exfiltration of Recovery Teams and isolated personnel, and  medical treatment of isolated personnel. -Battlespace awareness.  Lack of line-of-sight (LOS) and BLOS high speed LPE  data links for battle space/situational awareness of isolated personnel’s  location, threat information, and location of friendly forces. -Mission react time. Deployment shortfalls that prevent current combat rescue  forces from being mission ready upon commencement of hostilities – the most  likely time for losses.  -Adverse weather capability.  Lack of adverse weather penetration system(s) to  perform PR missions in a combat environment. ACC conducted an AoA to evaluate potential solutions to current validated  deficiencies. A new medium-lift helicopter was recommended as the most cost- effective solution to replace the aging HH-60G. This recommendation was briefed  to and approved by the AFROC in June 01. 2. Question:  Could you describe the KPPs as they exist for the program now? Answer:   •The PRV with a full, standard configuration load (SCL) must have a straight- line unrefueled combat mission radius of 325 nautical miles (nm). •The downwash in and around the recovery vehicle produced by the PRV during Hot  Day tactical hover operations in all environments (to include heavily forested,  steep mountainous, smooth-level, rough-level, smooth-sloped, and rough-sloped  terrain in calm and high crosswind conditions with loose particles such as tree  limbs, sand, water or rocks in the hover zone) at mid-mission gross weights  with SCL in Appendix C must not prevent recovery team or injured and uninjured  isolated personnel safe operations (hover extraction operations (hoist),  providing emergency lifesaving measures to isolated personnel, placement of a  non-ambulatory personnel in a hoist recovery device, overland movement, self- protection, communication, and swimming). •The PRV must satisfy 100% of top level information exchange requirements (IER)  designated as critical.  Satisfaction is defined as sender/receiver must be  able to execute the required function/mission task without operator  intervention.  (Interoperability KPP).   •To support Air and Space Expeditionary Force (ASEF) tasking requiring little  or no warning, mission ready PRV aircraft, weapons, and support equipment must  be capable of worldwide self-deployment (4000 nm) and mission ready within 24  hours of notification or configurable to fit within existing transport aircraft  (USAF AMC C-5 and C-17 transport aircraft) within 3 hours of initial  notification and capable of being made mission ready within 3 hours upon  arrival at destination. 3. Question:  What is the projected timeline for the program? Answer:  To accelerate procurement and fielding as much as possible from the  currently planned IOC of 2014 4. Question:  Does the PRV program expect to utilize other platforms, such as    UAVs as part of its organic group of systems? Answer:  The mission area of CSAR is expected to utilize UAV gathered  information to support successful mission execution. 5. Question  Mr Vokits spoke of the "Technical Descriptions + Challenges."  Could any of those be shared? Answer:  The PIXS PRV website contains a downloadable copy of all the briefings  used at Industry Day, including those on Technical Descriptions + Challenges.   These are related to translating operational requirements into specific  technical understanding of the performance requirements.  The user, the  acquirer, the sustainer and Industry must maintain an active interface and  continual interaction throughout the acquisition and sustainment phases to  ensure there is minimal confusion on requirements interpretation.  This is  especially true when using an evolutionary acquisition approach (today+s  standard DOD approach to weapons systems procurement). 6.  Question:  Milestone dates for RFP, SDD award, first flight, opeval, LRIP,  RAA, FRP? Answer:  No milestone dates have been set.  Programmatics are still being  developed.  A draft schedule leading to contract award was part of the  information provided to industry.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web site as these  dates are developed.   7.  Question:  Structure and details of competitive phase?   Answer:  Programmatics are still being developed.  Please refer to ASC PIXS web  site for updates.   8.  Question:  Specific Block 0 vs. Block 10 capabilities    Answer:  The block approach requirements are still under development.  Please  refer to ASC PIXS web site for updates.   9.  Question:  Concepts for future spirals?   Answer:  Technology insertion and future requirements will be addressed in the  Draft RFP.   10.  Question:  Development and operational test plans? How many test flights  are planned?   Answer:  The details have not been worked out.  The Test + Evaluation Master  Plan (TEMP) has not been drafted but is anticipated on being completed by RFP  release.   11.  Question:  How is the program balancing the risks poised by the aggressive  development timeline?   Answer:  The Air force has a Risk Management Process.   This process will begin  with a Risk Workshop on 23 Mar 04 and will continue throughout the development  acquisition phase.   12.  Question:  From lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, any changes to  requirements for performance, range, onboard capabilities, fleet size?   Answer:  The PRV ORD was developed from requirements derived during the CSAR  AoA. Lessons learned from Afghanistan and Iraq were incorporated during the  draft and coordination process.  They will continue to be analyzed as we write  and coordinate Change 1 to the ORD.  The process to produce Change 1 to  incorporate a Block modification approach has already begun. 13.  Question:  Any participation with navy and marines at this stage in the  program? Answer:  Not at this time.

Contractors who are interested in obtaining a copy of the draft Operational  Requirements Document (ORD) and a draft of the Statement of Objectives (SOO)  may request them by sending an e-mail message to SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil. All  requests must include the company name as well as the Commercial and Government  Entity (CAGE) code.  REGISTER FOR PRV INDUSTRY DAY: All individuals planning on attending the PRV Industry Day must register online  through MarketSpace via the link at the bottom of the announcement. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (Initial) (29 Jan 04) The Special Operations Forces-Combat Search and Rescue Systems Program Office  at Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) is starting up a new program to develop  and procure 132 Personnel Recovery Vehicles (PRV).  This effort is follow-on to  the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) completed by Air Combat Command (ACC) in  2001 which recommend replacing 104 HH-60G light helicopters with 132 medium- lift helicopters for the combat search and rescue mission.  The responsibility  for combat search and rescue was transferred from ACC to Air Force Special  Operations Command (AFSOC) on 1 October 2003.  The operational requirements  developed by ACC at the end of the Analysis of Alternatives remain essentially  the same.  Recently, the USAF has decided to evaluate the possibility of  accelerating Initial Operational Capability of the PRV Program.   An Industry Day will be held on a date TBA (March 2004 timeframe) at a location  TBA in the Dayton, Ohio area.  A follow-up announcement specifying the date and  place is forthcoming.  This is an initial opportunity for industry to meet with  cognizant government representatives and discuss the known requirements and  intent of the PRV program.  This Industry Day will also provide industry an  opportunity to comment on the Operational Requirements Document (ORD), to be  provided at a later date, and for industry to express an interest in becoming a  contender in the PRV program.  Contractors will be given an overview of the PRV program.  Contractors will  also be given an opportunity to discuss their understanding of the program and  to present their capabilities/ concepts in general terms during subsequent  meetings with the government.  This is to be considered an initial step in  establishing industry understanding of the PRV program and to allow the  government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate  and complete the program. This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government does not intend to award a  contract on the basis of this announcement.  Submitting capabilities and  concepts in response to this announcement is voluntary, and participants shall  not be compensated.  Any organization or company can obtain Personnel Recovery Vehicle announcements  and instructions via the Web at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil.   Questions regarding technical information and/or this announcement should be  directed to SOF PRV Program office at the following email address:   SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>The Department is herein clarifying that the April 1, 2004 announcement of a competitive sourcing effort under Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-76 pertains to services in support of the Office of Multifamily Housing’s administration of rental housing subsidies in the Section 202, 811, 236 and Rental Assistance Programs.  This is not to be confused with and does not affect in any way the Department’s efforts in regards to Performance Based Contract Administrators who provide contract administration services for the Project Based Section 8 portfolio.  HUD currently devotes an estimated 60 to 80 full time equivalent staffing level to administer the estimated 4,000 Section 202, 811, 236 and Rental Assistance Program agreements that will be covered by this competition.  Due to the complexity of the activity, the projected end date of the competition is 18 months from the original posted date of April 1, 2004.

There currently are no incumbent service providers performing the program monitoring and administrative functions anticipated to be covered by this competition.  It should be noted that General Accounting Office and the HUD Office of Inspector General have reported that this activity is not adequately being performed.

The purpose of this competition is to determine the most efficient and cost-effective means for providing the required services.  This will be accomplished by conducting a competitive procurement between the Government’s Most Efficient Organization and other non-federal sources.  Please note that a contract may or may not ultimately be awarded as a result of this competition.  Further announcements concerning this effort will be forthcoming.  The Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO) is De Ritchie, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, the Contracting Officer is Catherine Haddon, and the Agency Tender Official is J. Patrick Goray.

<DESC>The Department is herein clarifying that the April 1, 2004 announcement of a competitive sourcing effort under Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-76 pertains to services in support of the Office of Multifamily Housing’s administration of rental housing subsidies in the Section 202, 811, 236 and Rental Assistance Programs.  This is not to be confused with and does not affect in any way the Department’s efforts in regards to Performance Based Contract Administrators who provide contract administration services for the Project Based Section 8 portfolio.  HUD currently devotes an estimated 60 to 80 full time equivalent staffing level to administer the estimated 4,000 Section 202, 811, 236 and Rental Assistance Program agreements that will be covered by this competition.  Due to the complexity of the activity, the projected end date of the competition is 18 months from the original posted date of April 1, 2004.

There currently are no incumbent service providers performing the program monitoring and administrative functions anticipated to be covered by this competition.  It should be noted that General Accounting Office and the HUD Office of Inspector General have reported that this activity is not adequately being performed.

The purpose of this competition is to determine the most efficient and cost-effective means for providing the required services.  This will be accomplished by conducting a competitive procurement between the Government’s Most Efficient Organization and other non-federal sources.  Please note that a contract may or may not ultimately be awarded as a result of this competition.  Further announcements concerning this effort will be forthcoming.  The Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO) is De Ritchie, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, the Contracting Officer is Catherine Haddon, and the Agency Tender Official is J. Patrick Goray.

<DESC>The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) has developed a small-scale, pressure let down liquefaction system for use with natural gas pipelines.  This novel system has the features of being low cost, scalable, and flexible in relation to different gas compositions it can liquefy.   The pressure let down liquefaction process includes proprietary technology for removing CO2 and other pipeline gas contaminants. 
  
INEEL is presently seeking interest from qualified industrial firms to undertake a new research and development project that will focus on the design and fabrication of a small-scale prototype system capable of liquefying and/or using 100% of the gas feed stream produced from stranded gas wells, coal bed methane production, landfills or renewable biogas.   A system will be designed to optimize energy energy and to cost effectively remove undesirable constituents such as CO2, Water and H2S.  

The phase-gate project will also identify the minimum requirements to meet the needs of stranded gas applications and would make incorporate existing technologies and components, where possible to reduce development costs.  The three-year development project will culminate with deployment and demonstration of a prototype system.  The INEEL is soliciting interest from qualified industrial firms interested in participating in this project.  It is anticipated that the project will be carried out through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with funding and “in-kind” support being provided by the participant(s).  Interested parties should respond on or before 9/30/2004.  Questions relating to the proposed project may be directed to the contacts listed below:

Only one power cord is to be required to power each 8 cameras.  Each camera must be able to: Record 1280x1024 full frame greyscale pixels at speeds of up to 484 fps.  Capture no less than 200 markers at a maximum speed of no less than 10000 Hz for recording of rapid whole body movements.  Capture 2-dimensional images with a resolution of at least 1280 x 1024 pixels, to allow markers £ 6 mm in diameter to be accurately located (mean residual error < 1 mm) within a 2 m x 2 m x 2 m data capture space and (4) Support a wide range of lenses, to allow the lens to be appropriately matched to the data capture space. Cameras must be progressive scan at all speeds, to prevent blind spots and marker distortion.  The camera strobe intensity and marker detection threshold must be adjustable (from within the software), to provide for accurate detection of marker boundaries.  The location and orientation of each camera during a session must be automatically identified through a rapid (<2 min) calibration process.  Linearization to correct for camera lens distortions must be performed during the calibration process. In addition, the start of data collection must be capable of being triggered manually or upon an external TTL signal.  Post-event triggering capability is required, to prevent the loss of one-time events.  The end of data collection must be capable of being specified manually, upon an external TTL signal, or after an elapsed time.  64 channels of integral, synchronized, 16-bit analog-to-digital data conversion are required, at sampling rates up to 4000 Hz, to allow data collection from force plates, EMG, and other external devices.  These data must be accessible for display and processing through the system software.  The system must capture, store to disc, and display synchronized movie data from a color video camera.  Real-time output of measured and calculated translational and rotational data is required, for immediate verification of data quality and for providing of real-time feedback. The System is to have Real Time display of analog data in main software.  For time efficiency in data processing, software must be capable of automatic 3-D reconstruction and identification/labeling of the paths of at least 200 markers from the camera data, without operator intervention or pre-identification of 2-D images.  It must provide marker path editing capabilities, including: deletion and creation of points, path re-labeling, breaking and joining of paths, exchanges and copying between paths, and cubic splining across gaps.  Editing must be possible in both an 3-D display and an X-Y-Z coordinate format.  An undo capability is required. The System must possess Post-processing functionality for data filtering, biomechanical movement analysis, and processed data export.  For time efficiency, the post-processing software must allow batch processing across a user-selected set of processes, subjects, and trials, without need for user interaction during processing.  The capacity to add custom user-defined functionality to the post-processing must be provided.  The post-processing software for biomechanical movement analysis must be capable of computing 3-dimensional joint kinematics and kinetics from marker path and force data.  This software must allow the users to develop their own biomechanical analysis models, in addition to standard models provided.  (BB)   One standard model provided must presently be in widespread use for clinical gait analyses, to provide clinical acceptance for our associated results. (Plug-In-Gait)  The output of the biomechanical movement analysis software must be saved in binary format, to conserve storage space, and must be exportable to ASCII files.  For application to teaching, the system must be capable of providing a multimedia report that includes: interactive animated 3-D figures, synchronized video, and graph windows for synchronized, normalized, or statistically processed data.  Such reports must be readable by any Windows PC and small enough to be e-mailed or fit on a CD. (Polygon)  The system must run on an IBM compatible PC under Windows 2000/XP for compatibility with existing computers and software.  It must be network compatible, preferably using 100 base T, to provide for simultaneous access from multiple PC’s to allow simultaneous data processing by multiple users.  The software must have the ability be a Windows Active X Automation Server.  This Plug-In will allow users to run MATLAB, LABVIEW, MS Word, Excel, or Access, C++ and others through the Workstation software to simplify the processing keystrokes dramatically.  System must have the capability for at least 4 users to process data simultaneously. Installation and on-site training must be provided.  Service contracts for hardware and software are to be available from the system supplier. Contracts are to include repair or replacement of defective components, support by telephone and e-mail, and periodic software updates. Firms who wish to identify their interest and capability to provide an alternate system which will meet the capabilities and functionality described above may notify the Contracting Officer in writing, no later than 4:30pm 9/14/04.

<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), a DOE/NNSA facility located on Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico and operated/maintained under contract by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Corporation subsidiary, has an ongoing requirement for contract services (consisting of personnel, equipment, and materials) in support of testing operations conducted primarily in the facilities mentioned below.  SNL contemplates conducting a competitive, small-business set-aside procurement, as a follow-on to its current contract (expiring in November 2005), on which the incumbent contractor is expected to bid.  Therefore, SNL is seeking experienced, interested small businesses for purposes of developing a source list for a request for quotations (RFQ) that it hopes to issue sometime in November-December 2004.  It is estimated that the new contract will have a value of up to $3 million/year for up to ten years; however, given that demand for the test facilities is a function of market forces over which SNL has little or no control, there is no guarantee that the requirement for contract services will remain at its current level.

SNL emphasizes that the requirement is for support services, as the scientific/analytical functions related to the testing operations are generally served by SNL scientists and engineers.

What follows is a synopsis of the requirement:

Furnish personnel, equipment, and material to Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) for the maintenance and support of testing operations at facilities located primarily in Area III and Coyote Canyon, but which may also include Area I and remote locations such as the Tonopah Test Range (located in the state of Nevada), and the White Sands Missile Range (located in southern New Mexico).   

The Contractor shall provide maintenance and support of testing operations at the facilities listed below. SNL reserves the right to add additional facilities to this list at a future date.

1. Rocket Sled Track Complex.  Used for a controlled environment for high-velocity impact, aerodynamic, acceleration, and erosion testing of small and large test items.

2. Aerial Cable Facility.  Used for precision testing of: nuclear material shipping containers for certification of capability to withstand impacts; full-scale, air-deliverable military systems tested under realistic target engagement scenarios; airborne sensors and sensor-fuzed weapons systems suspended in a stable platform located above ground targets. 

3. Vibration & Acoustic Complex.  Used for random vibration, shock on shakers, seismic simulation, sinusoidal vibration, combined environments, and acoustic tests using electrodynamic and electrohydraulic shakers with various forces.

4. Centrifuge Complex.  Used for producing long-interval, continuous high-acceleration loadings on test articles.  Test articles can also be exposed to a vibration environment by mounting a vibration shaker (Vibrafuge) on the end of the 29-foot centrifuge arm.	

5. Radiant Heat Complex.  Includes four separate structures located inside a fenced enclosure.  This complex uses high-intensity, electrically produced radiant energy, furnaces, or other facilities to pyrolyze test items at temperatures up to 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit, and thereby simulate the effects of fires resulting from transportation and handling accidents.	

6. Lurance Canyon Burn Site.  Consists of several open-pool and enclosure fire-testing facilities.  The open-pool facilities have been used extensively to certify the survivability of various systems, such as containers specially designed to transport hazardous materials, tractor/trailer systems designed to transport nuclear weapons and spent nuclear fuel, and nuclear weapons.  

7. Drop/Impact Complex.  Provides a controlled environment for high-velocity impact testing on a variety of targets, as well as water impact testing and underwater testing.  This complex can test items containing radioactive materials, high explosives, and security classified items.

8. Mechanical Shock Complex.  Provides laboratory-controlled shock simulation capability specializing in nonexplosive simulation of pyrotechnic shock.

Some examples of the types of systems and equipment with which the Contractor must work include, but are not limited to, the following: oil, water, compressed gas, power, experimental chambers, signal cabling, and control systems.

The Contractor shall perform work in potentially hazardous working conditions.  Some examples of such conditions include, but are not limited to, the following: work performed at heights above ground level; the movement of heavy equipment; proximity to handling of high-voltage circuitry, toxic and radioactive materials; and confined space, explosives and normal construction hazards.

<DESC>NA This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes and no formal solicitation exists at this time.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, management, and financial capability of such offerors to perform this type of work. The Capability Statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside is warranted or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.  The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region has a requirement for replacement of sump pumps located in the Arizona and Nevada Tunnel Plug Outlet Works (Lower Penstock) at Hoover Dam (Mohave County, Arizona and Clark County, Nevada) and is seeking responsible sources having capabilities of performing the work.  Principal features of the work include the following:  (1)  Removing and disposing of two 10,000 gpm pumps and associated equipment including column pipe, line shaft, discharge head and piping, pump motor, suction piping, valves, floor stands, stem guides, valve stems, and metal supports; (2) Excavating concrete and rock, and placing concrete for enlargement of existing sumps; (3) Furnishing, shop testing, and installing two 10,000 gpm vertical turbine pumps, pump motors, and associated equipment; (4) Furnishing and installing steel piping and valves for the turbine pumps; (5) Furnishing and installing new miscellaneous metalwork and FRP grating; (6) Un-watering construction areas; (7) Removing existing lower operating platforms in the pipe galleries; (8) Removing existing 8" discharge piping and replace, under access platforms; and (9) Painting piping, valves, and miscellaneous metalwork. Unusual conditions may require monitoring and removal of leakage in work areas below the Colorado River water surface while removing equipment normally used to remove leakage or hold the river back.  The work site is below the Dam and Powerplant and logistics is extremely difficult and challenging.  Construction activities will create problems for traffic flow and other scheduled contracting activities.  The estimated magnitude of this project is $250,000 to $500,000. This is a stand alone contract.  This acquisition will be conducted under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 237110, which establishes a small business size standard of $27.5 million. Capability statements are to be submitted not later than Aug 27, 2004.

Additionally, all responses to this sources sought shall include company name and address, business size and type (8(a), HubZone, Small Business, etc), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number.   Capability statements shall not exceed five pages in length.  This information will be used to assist the Contracting Officer in developing the procurement strategy, in particular, including whether an 8(a) or Hubzone set-aside is warranted or if another socio-economic set-aside strategy is more appropriate.  All responses to this sources sought notice shall be provided to Cedrick D. Williams/LC-3113, Contract Specialist, P. O.  Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470 or via e-mail cwilliams@lc.usbr.gov.

<SUBJECT>B -- Analysis of Gun-Free Schools Act State Reports
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-EDOSDF-04-900025
<RESPDATE>083004
<ARCHDATE>09142004
<CONTACT>See Description for Contact Information, See 'Description, Phone See Description, Fax See Description, Email See Description
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (Department) intends to award a purchase order to procure services for the analysis of State reports required under the Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA), which was enacted in October 1994 and reauthorized as Part A, Subpart 3 under Title IV of the Elementary and Secondary and Education Act (ESEA), as amended (20 U.S.C. 7151).  The specific purpose of this procurement is to aggregate and analyze data from the GFSA State reports for 2003-2004 and to prepare a detailed final report.  The final report must include an examination of data published in reports covering collections from previous reporting years.  The report includes, but is not limited to, a description of the number of students expelled by local education agencies within States in compliance with the GFSA, as well as other information related to the types of firearms involved, referrals to alternative placements, and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) status of expelled students.  Westat is the principle organization with considerable expertise in collecting and analyzing GFSA data.  This purchase order is intended as a sole source award to be made to Westat in Rockville, Maryland.  However, all responsible sources may request a copy of the statement of work and submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the Department.  For further information, contact Michelle Padilla at (202) 260-2648.

Sole Source Justification:  The Gun-Free Schools Act (GFSA) was reauthorized under Section 4141 of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (20 U.S.C. 7151) and requires each State receiving ESEA funds to have in effect a State law requiring local educational agencies (LEAs) to expel from school for a period of not less than one year a student found to have brought a firearm to school, or to have possessed a firearm at a school.  The GFSA also requires LEAs that receive ESEA funds to adopt a policy requiring referral to the criminal justice or juvenile delinquency system of any student who brings a firearm to school or possesses a firearm at school.  Each year, States are required to report to the Secretary of Education concerning implementation of the GFSA requirements.

The Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools proposes to award a purchase order, not to exceed $25,000, to Westat to collect and analyze the data submitted by States for the 2003-2004 school year.  Westat will also develop a final report that provides a detailed examination of the data found in the GFSA State reports.  Over the past eight (8) years, States have submitted GFSA reports in a required format.  Data have been collected by Westat for the 1995-96, 1996-97, 1997-98, 1998-99, 1999-00, 2000-01, 2001-02, and 2002-03 school years over this timeframe.  The quality and accuracy of the data has been a recurring problem.  As a result, a considerable amount of time and effort is required to verify the data submitted and analyze data that is not necessarily comparable from state to state but, at the same, time make comparisons that will provide a national picture of the implementation of the GFSA and compliance.  Data contained in the GFSA report is receiving increasing scrutiny from the Congress, the media, and the public.  

The unusual and compelling need for this particular data collection activity is consistent with the requirements of 48 C.F.R. Part 6.302-2.  Because of the complexity of the data and the need for expert knowledge in the area of GFSA reporting, it would be extremely productive and cost effective to utilize the expertise of a source that is familiar with the issues related to this specific data collection.  Westat has the experience and knowledge that is unique to other sources that specialize in data collection in that it has built a knowledge base on the issues of the GFSA and an effective system that responds immediately to the urgent needs of this collection activity.  For this reason the continued use of Westat is crucial to meeting the needs of this Department.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for the Small Agency Council Financial Committee (SAC FC).   

The Tax Accountability Act of 2002 expanded the number of federal agencies who are required by law to prepare and subject to audit financial statement packages annually.  Many of those new small agencies subject to this requirement are currently attempting to compile their first set of auditable statements.  More are attempting to compile their first Performance and Accountability Report within the newly approved and substantially shortened guidelines of OMB and subject them to review this year.   
 
The Small Agency Council Financial Committee (SAC FC) is planning to hold a December 1, 2004 meeting to facilitate small agency interaction with financial services firms who offer assistance in the compilation of small agency financial statements or audit services in the review of those statements.  If you represent one of these firms and would like to participate in the meeting by either offering to speak to the group about a current success, in coordination with an agency, please let us know.  If you would like to attend this meeting or future SAC FC meetings and discuss these items please let us know.  Historically, SAC FC meetings have had attendance of approximately 100 representatives of small federal agencies. A small agency is defined as having less than 5,000 FTE’s.   
 
The meeting is currently scheduled to be held at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), 445 12th Street, S.W., Washington, DC 20554, on December 1, 2004 between 9:00 AM and noon.   Advanced registration is required.  Attendees have to be U. S. Citizens or holders of valid green cards. If you would like to participate please send an email to: SAC-FC@fcc.gov by 4:00 PM, September 15, 2004.  

Please note that the allotted length and the format of each presentation will depend on the number of interested firms.  A meeting agenda with detailed information will be sent via email to all interested sources no-later-than November 15, 2004.  

NOTE:  All responses/questions have to be sent via email to:   SAC-FC@fcc.gov

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  In response to an urgent Operation Iraq Freedom (OIF) mission, the US Army PM Firefinder is seeking sources and information to expedite a Radar Processor Replac ement for the Firefinder AN-TPQ-36(V)8 system.  The AN-TPQ-36(V)8 is a weapon locating radar, capable of locating mortar, artillery and rocket projectiles.  The AN-TPQ-36(V)8 is a range-gated pulse doppler radar which uses an electronically scanned (phase- frequency) antenna, a coherent pulse transmitter and a digital signal processor to perform the functions required to provide automatic first-round location and impact of hostile indirect fire weapons.  The Government is seeking to rapidly replace the obsol ete radar processor in existing currently deployed Army radars, thereby allowing the radars to meet all specification requirements in heavy clutter conditions.  The processor shall be immediately available, state-of-the art in speed and performance, and in corporate an architecture that allows future expansion, modification, and integration into objective radar systems. REQUIREMENTS:A) Key Radar System Performance Requirements:   The replacement radar processor shall provide, as a minimum, the following system performance after installation: Location Range - Probability of Location (PL): Mortars: 90% PL from 3 - 18km; linearly degraded PL from 3 Km to 750m (45% @ 750m) Artillery: 70% PL from 3 - 14.5 km Rockets: 80% PL from 8 - 24 km  Maximum hostile weapon location sector:90 degree azimuth sector Location accuracy- 50% Circular Error Probable (CEP) (whichever is greater): Mortars: 40 meters or 0.40 % of range Mortar Volley: 80 meters or 0.80 % of range Artillery: 65 meters or 0.65 % of range Artillery Volley: 90 meters or 0.90 % of range Rocket: 120 meters or 1.00 % of range MLRS: 120 meters or 1.00 % of range Hostile Impact Prediction: 500m Classification by weapon type: Mortar/Artillery - 90% Friendly Fire: (PL  85%)(whichever is greater) 	Air Burst: 30m or 0.30 % range Spherical Error Probability 	Datum Plane: 20m or 0.20 % range CEP Friendly Fire Impact Prediction: (whichever is greater) 	Mortar: 40m or 0.40 % range CEP 	Artillery: 65m or 0.65 % range CEP Performance in Clutter: Detailed clutter performance is provided in the specification listed below.  The AN-TPQ-36(V)8 with Replacement Radar Processor will be tested for its performance in various clutter environments, particularly while in the presence of discrete ground and ai rborne clutter from targets such as ground vehicles, fixed and rotary winged aircraft. The system specifications can be found in the reference Performance Specification for the Radar Set AN-TPQ-36(V)8  Revision A, dated 1 March 1999,  and can be obtained from the POC listed below. B) Interfaces: 	The Radar Processor Replacement shall be electrically and mechanically integrated into the existing AN-TPQ-36(V)8 shelter.  The existing radar software code will be available for reuse/ porting. Modifications and enhancements may be necessary for full spe cification compliance. C) Expectations: 	The expedited production representative Radar Processor Replacement shall be demonstrated as having minimal risk as early as possible after program initiation.  This is an urgent requirement, and therefore, the most expedient delivery is the critical dete rmining factor.   Schedule/scenario discussion should include: the early technical risk assessment, integration of the AN-TPQ-36(V)8 software into the processor, processor integration into an actual radar, and a testing effort that includes, as a minimum, performance measurement against live ammunition in a clutter environment.  Requirement is a quantity of 24 fully functional production representative processors ready for integration into the AN-TPQ-36(V)8 radar system delivered as quickly as possible but no later than 12 - 15 months.   Realistic order of magnitude costs for both  non-recurring and recurring should be a part of the package. It is requested that only contractors with proven radar counter fire experience respond to this RFI. Emphasis should be placed on currently available radar processor hardware to mitigate risk and expedite schedule. The Government will not reimburse contrac tors or responders to this notice for any costs incurred in responding, or in subsequent exchange of information.  All proprietary and restricted information shall be clearly marked.  All information shall be submitted no later than 15 September 2004.  Que stions and responses should be addressed to:  Stanley Dobies, PM Firefinder, Bldg 2525, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703, 732-427-5224, email: Stanley.Dobies@iews.monmouth.army.mil.

<CONTACT>Ina.Joyce.Ohrwashel, 212-264-0154
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District is issuing this Sources Sough Notice to solicit for dredgers to participate in an operational test of an alternate fuel.  The US Army Corps of Engineers is inviting dredgers with current dredging co ntracts with USACE in the New York-New Jersey-Long Island Non Attainment area to evaluate the AquaMixÔ  emulsified diesel fuel in a dredge with at least 3000 horsepower for a one week trial period between October 01, 2004 and December 31, 2004.  AquaMix(tm ) fuel is an emulsified diesel fuel.  It is a blend of regular diesel fuel, water, a seasonal component if necessary, and a proprietary emulsification additive formulation.  AquaMix(tm) fuel, utilizing PuriNOx(tm) technology has been verified from an emiss ions reduction perspective by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The US EPA has also verified the emission reduction potential and certified the fuel for no health risks beyond those associated with conventional diesel fuel.  Currently, Sunoco's Aq uaMixÔ, utilizing Lubrizol's PuriNOx additive chemistry is the only EPA approved NOX reducing fuel alternative.  Sunoco, is the sole distributor for Lubrizol's technology in the Northeast region.   The evaluation period is estimated to take up to16 days.  Seven days of baseline operation on regular #2 marine diesel fuel, one day for fueling and preparation for the use of AquaMix(tm), 7 days of operation on AquaMix(tm), and a 4-6 hours of crew debrief ing per shift following the operational test period on the last day.  The demonstration is set up to run for one week, during which the dredge operators retain the right to terminate the evaluation period after 3 days of operation with AquaMix(tm) if a problem occurs while using the AquaMix(tm) product and routine dredging o perations.  The daily and weekly operational productivity, following the normal reporting procedure, will then be monitored for 7 days using AquaMix(tm) fuel.  This productivity will be compared to the previously averaged operation using standard #2 marine  diesel fuel.  The dredging in both evaluations is to be conducted in similar media as defined by the US Army Corps of Engineers.Engines operating on AquaMix(tm) fuel must be run for at least 15 minutes every 14 days.The dredging company agrees to allow US ACE, Lubrizol, and Sunoco personnel, to observe and advise for the purposes of documenting the dredging performance of AquaMix(tm) versus regular #2 marine diesel.  In addition, Lubrizol and Sunoco can advise on the handling of AquaMix(tm) fuel.   The government reserves the right to make multiple awards under this solicitation.  Awards will be made to the lowest responsive, responsible bidder. This is not a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract.  This synopsis neither  constitutes a Request for Proposal  or  Invitation for Bid.   This Sources Sought notification should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for  any purpose.   Responses are due as indicated in the due date requirement above.  Any questions regarding this survey shall be directed to Bonnie Hulkower, biologist, at 212-264-5798, via e-mail at bonnie.hulkower@us.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>R -- Multifamily Housing Rental Assistance Contract Administration for Programs Other Than Section 8
<DESC>This public announcement is being issued as required by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 (Revised May 29, 2003).  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announces that it intends to conduct an A-76 Standard Competition to determine whether or not the work described in support of the HUD Non-Section 8 Multi-Family Housing Contract Administration will be performed by the Federal Government or by a private sector or other non-federal source.   Due to the complexity of the activity, the projected end date is 18 months from posted date. 

Currently, an estimated 60-80 full time equivalents at locations throughout the United States are performing the activity.  Our understanding is that there currently are no incumbent service providers performing the program monitoring functions anticipated to be covered by this competition.  It should be noted that GAO and HUD’s Office of Inspector General have stated that this activity is not adequately being performed.

The purpose of this study is to determine the most efficient and cost-effective means for providing the required services.  This will be accomplished by conducting a cost comparison between the Government’s Most Efficient Organization and a non-federal source.  Please note that a contract may or may not ultimately be awarded as a result of this competition.  Further announcements concerning this effort will be forthcoming.  The Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO) is De Ritchie, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, the Contracting Officer is Catherine Haddon, and the Agency Tender Official is J. Patrick Goray.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Denver Federal Center, PO Box 25007 (D-7810), Denver, CO 80225,  has a requirement for a Security Event Management Tool (SEM).  This requirement is a result of a Bureau directive and will enable security staff to correlate the large amount of data collected into one centralized system to optimize Reclamation's Incident Response Capability (IRC) and IT forensics potential.  The SEM is a software tool which collects and reposits security event data from various Information Technology (IT) systems and devices.  The SEM is to allow security staff to analyze, assess, and track specific and a combination of security events.  The SEM will initially be deployed in the Denver Office (DO), Denver, CO, Perimeter and Security support of locally supported devices, servers, and enterprise systems (e.g., RECNET).  After the initial implementation in Denver, the SEM product will be deployed Reclamation wide as an integral component of IT security practices and procedures.  Other potential locations include Washing D.C., and Sacramento, CA.  The SEM should be deployed out to the rest of Reclamation as requirements arise and funding become available.  This deployment will entail development of base SEM practices, creation of a cadre of trained and experienced security staff users, and establishment of a documented body of Reclamation specific SEM experience.  The requirement consists of the SEM software, software maintenance and technical support, installation and implementation services, as well as on-site training.  A proof of concept will be required to ensure that the tool meets the requirements stated herein prior to award of the contract by the apparent successful offeror.  This will also allow Reclamation the opportunity to test the integration of all system components.  The proof of concept is to be performed the week of September 13, 2004, and should take approximately 2-3 days.  The SEM software is to be delivered by September 20, 2004.  In response to the solicitation, all responsible sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by the agency.  Solicitation No. 04SQ810731 identifies the minimum requirements and may be viewed and downloaded from the Fedbizopps website at http://ideasec.nbc.gov .

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This requirement is set-aside for small business concerns, under NAIC code 423610-size standard of 500 employees.  The United States Coast Guard (USCG) has a need to conduct underwater inspection of piers, wharfs, docks, etc. for explosives of other parasitic attachments.  The contractor is required to furnish a compact and lightweight system capable of underwater remote operations and capable of underwater imaging for inspection purposes.  The primary intended use of these vehicles is to assist USCG security personnel in the accomplishment of typical missions.  The projected operating environment includes harsh maritime conditions as well as operating from many different types of vessel and shore structures.  The system must be easily transportable and deployed by a two-person team.  Five vehicles are required.  The system must be useable by already existing USCG Personnel with no technical background and on already existing platforms with no structural modifications and shall be two-person portable.  The system power requirements will be such that power reasonably expected on most U.S. Coast Guard platforms, to include small boats, will be sufficient to power the system.  The system shall be ergonomically designed to allow for a minimum of 8 hours continuous operation and shall be commercial overnight shipping compatible.  The display and operations must be intuitive so as not to require significant additional technical training and the system must be environmentally protected (waterproof and shock resistant).  The system shall have an open architecture to support modular sensor exchanges; must be usable in reasonably expected environmental conditions to support expected USCG missions; shall be capable of station keeping in opposing currents of 2 knots minimum; shall be expandable to include an integrated vehicle tracking system; shall be able to capture images in no natural light conditions; shall be capable of operating the vehicle underwater at a depth of 300ft; shall employ an optimal tether design; and shall be able to record images and video. The system must be sustainable.  The system components shall be modular, as far as practicable, to afford easy and affordable component replacement by non-technical security personnel.  The contractor shall provide twenty (20) hours of initial operational training with delivery of each system at user site for up to six personnel.  The contractor provided training shall include hard copy and electronic training material for follow-on training.  The system shall be operable and field maintainable with no more than 20 hours of training. The contractor shall include a long term maintenance plan to include a two year warranty and offer the option of purchasing yearly maintenance plans thereafter.    Please include applicable terms and conditions of the warranties included in your offer.  The contractor shall provide any special tools required.  The system must be readily available.

<DESC>The Defense Contracting Command-Washington (DCCW), on behalf of the United States Army Legal Services Agency (USALSA) is issuing a combined Synopsis/Solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisitio n Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only Solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number for this acquisition is W74V8H-04-T-0157 and is being issued as a Request for Proposal. This solicitation, incorporated provisions and clauses, is in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. The solicitation is unrestricted. Courier(s) must have a TO P SECRET clearance on or before 1 Oct 2004. North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 492110.  Requirement will be for base year with four (4) option years. The proposal shall include the following information to be considered: Technica l proposal should provide sufficient information for evaluation but not more than 20 pages. A Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) proposal is required for the base year and all option years for all services described in SOW:  A. 	General Information A.1.  Introduction For the past several years, the United States Army Legal Services Agency (USALSA) has required the services of a courier for daily scheduled and non-scheduled pick-up and delivery of letters and packages and intra-agency mail handling activities.  The prom pt pick-up and delivery of letters and packages is critical to USALSA's mission.  Courier will also be responsible for daily mail metering of outgoing mail and distribution of incoming mail. A.2.  Background Information A.2.1	The mission of USALSA is to provide administrative, personnel, fiscal, and logistical legal support, including legal research services, as required, for all elements of the agency according to law and the policy of The Judge Advocate General (TJAG).  USALSA has fourteen Divisions.  A very brief synopsis of some of the Divisions is listed below: A.2.2	The US Army Court of Criminal Appeals (ACCA), which performs appellate review of courts-martial and reviews trial records.  The Office of the Judicial Advisor/Clerk of Court, which is the administrative arm of the ACCA.  The Trial Judiciary Division presides over general and special courts-martial throughout the Army.  The Government Appellate Davison represents the US before the ACCA, Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and the US Supreme Court.  The Defense Appellate Division represents accused b efore the ACCA, Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces and the US Supreme Court. A.2.3	The Contract Appeals Division of the USALSA represents the Army in contract disputes and bid protests and has a caseload valued at between $300 and  $400 million.  The Regulatory Law & Intellectual Property Division of USALSA represents the Army befo re Federal and State regulatory tribunals relating to utilities, communications, transportation, mail and other regulated entities.  This Division also provides counsel to ALL commands and installations of the Army without in-house patent/IP Counsel. A.2.4   The performance of courier services has required one full-time person for each 8-hour USALSA business day. A.3. Scope Inter-Agency and Intra-Agency Mail pick-up and delivery. A.3.1	The contractor shall provide daily courier services, scheduled and unscheduled within the National Capital Region (NCR) for delivery of packages between USALSA and the Office of the Judge Advocate General at the Pentagon and in Rosslyn, Virginia vari ous government offices in the Pentagon, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF), and the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA). The NCR encompasses a 50-mile radius of 901 North Stuart Street, Arlington, and includes Washington, DC, For t Belvoir, Fort McNair, Alexandria, VA, and McLean, VA.  There are scheduled daily pic k-ups on a daily scheduled route and unscheduled pick-up and deliveries that are not on the daily scheduled route. There are seventeen scheduled daily pick-ups.  Historically, the number of unscheduled deliveries has fluctuated between zero and fifteen per  day. Some deliveries may involve very late afternoon notice and require a quick delivery, for example a delivery to DOJ with a same-day filing deadline.  The number of miles traveled per day has been as few as 80 miles to as many as 140; and the size of p ackages couriered has been letters to boxes up to 50 pounds. A.3.2	Internal USALSA Mail Handling. The courier contractor shall provide mail distribution (received via US Postal Service) and mail metering services for USALSA within the North Stuart USALSA office.  Historically, the outgoing mail metered has been as few as 200 pieces and to many as 450 p er day, including thirty-seven cent letters and packages of various sizes.  Sizes of incoming mail can vary from large boxes, Federal Express, certified mail, or thirty-seven cent letters. A.3.3	Special Considerations. The established delivery times for CAAF, GAO, and ASBCA are a must and failure to make scheduled deliveries/pick-ups to CAAF, GAO, and ASBCA is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.  The courier contractor must be able to independently adjust to daily ch anging workload requirements while meeting all scheduled and unscheduled pick-ups and deliveries.  Satisfactory performance will require the contractor to be familiar with the streets, roads and addresses within the National Capital Region.  [AU1] A good k nowledge of Washington, DC, and the street configuration is critical for timely afternoon deliveries during rush hour.  If a courier does not return documents from our superior appellate court in a timely manner, justice may be denied both the appellant an d the government. The time to file any appeal with the Supreme Court of the United States begins running from the date CAAF decides the case.  Unless the contractor picks up and delivers the documents to ACCA at the allotted time, the parties to the litiga tion will be unaware of any decision.  The contractor is responsible for transporting the original record of trial. This is the official transcript that is stored for 40-50 years. If that record is lost, replacement is almost impossible and extremely costl y. A.3.4	The success of the Contract Appeals Division mission hinges upon its ability to make timely filings and submissions of litigation documents with the General Accounting Office (GAO), the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) and other feder al courts as appropriate.  On many occasions, filing deadlines are directed by rules of procedures and/or a Judge presiding over a particular case.  Failure to meet the deadline for filing may result in the GAO/ASBCA reprimanding the Contract Appeals Divis ion, refusing to accept the filings, issuing an opinion against the Army, or other negative action. A.3.5	Timely deliveries of documents to the GAO are also particularly important.  By its rules of procedure and federal statute, the Contract Appeals Division typically makes multiple filings per case to the GAO that have very short filing deadlines. This frequently requires the delivery of highly sensitive information, typically bound in many notebooks and then boxes. Because of the extremely tight deadlines associated with this intense and fast-paced litigation, same day deliveries to GAO are frequently r equired. Additionally, same day delivery to local counsel/law offices is frequently required.   A.3.6	The contractor must utilize a vehicle with courier logo/license on the vehicle for parking in the Department of Defense and Government locations throughout the National Capital Region (NCR).  The courier's vehicle must be large enough to transport up  to 15 boxes that are up to 26 inches tall inches tall, by 44 inches wide, and weighing up to 50 pounds each. A.3.7	The contractor's courier assigne d must have the ability to obtain a Department of Defense Badge, a Common Access Card (CAC) and a military vehicle decal for military installations (Fort McNair, Fort Belvoir, and Fort Myer).  Courier also must have a Top Secret clearance on or before 1 Oc tober 2004 and comply with all applicable security regulations and guidance, including the incorporated DD254.  Courier assigned must have COMSEC (Communication Security) account/access within 30 days of start date or not-later-than 1 November 2004.   B.

<DESC>The purpose of this notification is to provide answers to questions received to date regarding solicitation 200-2004-Q-01613.  Question 1:  The solicitation states that the laboratory be "certified and well-equipped."  What specific certification do you require?  And what proof of certification would be necessary?  Answer 1:  We request proof of meeting the requirements of ISO 17025. Question 2:  When specifying what test method to use, I've noted that in some cases a CDC method is cited while in others the contractor is given the opportunity to use their own test method.  What sort of documentation and validation are required for the contractor test methods used?  Also, can you provide a list of the specific CDC methods that are to be used?  Answer 2:  The CDC method is: "Protocol to measure the quantity of nicotine contained in smokeless tobacco products manufactured, imported, or packaged in the United States." It can be found in the Federal Register (1997;62:24116-9).  Results from the Standard Addition assay (described in the CDC protocol) can be provided as documentation that the assay is working properly for them.   For other methods used by the contractor, they would need to provide a written description of the method, and copies of their standard curves and QA/QC documentation.  Question 3:  In the solicitation, it is noted that the Period of Performance is "from date of award through 6 months from date of receipt of the smokeless tobacco products."  Do you have an idea of how long the bid evaluation and award process will take (and when the winning contractor might begin to see samples in their laboratory)?  Answer 3:  The estimated award date is August 31, 2004.  We anticipate that the smokeless tobacco products would be provided to the contractor within 4-8 weeks of award of the contract.  Any additional inquiries regarding this solicitation must be received by the Contracting Officer, Sherry Smallwood, no later than 2:00pm on August 19, 2004.*****

The Contractor shall travel to Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.

The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s);

2.6.2.3	          provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues

2.6.3		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must:

2.6.3.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.3.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

Tajikistan is one of the poorest countries in the world.  A bitter civil war from 1992-1997 stunted Tajikistan’s economic development, hindered economic reforms and discouraged foreign investment.  The security situation has dramatically improved since the conclusion of Tajikistan’s civil war peace accords in 1997.  President Rakhmonov is eager to implement structural and economic reforms and has identified foreign investment as a top priority.  The United States government has been more pro-active in Tajikistan over the last year and is committed to promoting reform in Tajikistan.  

One of the areas the US Embassy in Dushanbe believes has good potential for investment is the agribusiness/food-processing sector.  The country has a largely agrarian economy producing primarily fruits and vegetables, but lacks value added products that could be used for export and for growing domestic demand.  There are already several foreign companies working in Tajikistan in this sector including a company from California that is exporting dried tomatoes.

In Kyrgyzstan, also a predominantly agricultural based economy producing meat, cotton, fruits and vegetables, the agribusiness sector is more developed.   However, this sector is in need of additional equipment and technology transfer.  Soviet-era company directors continue to control substantial ownership interests in privatized food-processing companies.  There is, however, a greater realization of the need to hire skilled managers who are able to operate the businesses more efficiently and competitively.  In addition, new small and medium-size companies, started by entrepreneurs, are entering the market.  As a result, investment in the food-processing sector is growing.
