<DESC>W15QKN-12-R-E013					W15QKN-13-R-E013

QUESTION: Reference - The posting for RFP W15QKN-12-R-E013 indicates that the contract will be for the acquisition of Commercial Services with incidental supplies  The PWS for T0 0001 indicates that satisfactory completion cannot be achieved without designing, testing and delivering an RF Subsystem that meets a detailed set of requirements.  Is the RF Subsystem an incidental supply item or is T0 0001 a fixed price supply task order for a commercial item?
RESPONSE: The contract allows for the delivery of material and hardware. This item is considered hardware.
QUESTION: Is there any Proprietary Data associated with the NGATS RF Microwave Frequency Support?
RESPONSE: There is no proprietary data associated with this task.
QUESTION: Para 4.3.1 of the TASK01 PWS states shall support all current and future requirements
Recommend above wording be changed to the following: shall support all current and known future requirements
RESPONSE:  We would like the system to be robust enough to support future technologies. The contractors should analyze what the industry roadmaps are and plan for growth of their design to support these technologies.
QUESTION: Para 4.3.1.1 of the TASK01 PWS states shall assure all current and future systems are addressed.
Recommend above wording be changed to the following: shall assure all current and known future systems are addressed.
RESPONSE: We would like the system to be robust enough to support future technologies. The contractors should analyze what the industry roadmaps are and plan for growth of their design to support these technologies.
QUESTION: Para 4.23.1 of the TASK01 PWS states All data delivered to the Government shall be unlimited. All markings contrary to this and existing in the TDP shall be removed before delivery.
Recommend above wording be changed to the following: The Government shall have unlimited rights to data that is developed under this contract.
RESPONSE:   Noted. The wording is not changed.
QUESTION:
BASIC PWS Para 4.3.2 states The contractor shall develop test stations that conform to DoD standards for ATS, support open architecture, utilize state of the art technologies, contain no proprietary hardware/software, and utilize commercial off the shelf instruments to the greatest extent possible.
Recommend above wording be changed as follows: The contractor shall develop test stations that conform to DoD standards for ATS, support open architecture, utilize state of the art technologies, contain no proprietary hardware/software to the greatest extent possible, and utilize commercial off the shelf instruments to the greatest extent possible.
RESPONSE:   Proprietary information is not to be submitted. The wording will not be changed.
QUESTION:
TASK 01 PWS Paragraph 4.20.1 states One complete set of technical data suitable for recomplete for the all prototype hardware shall be delivered. The design of the hardware product baseline shall be documented through the use of engineering data. The TDP shall conform to data item description, DI-SESS-8100D (CDRL A008), Product Drawings/Models and Associated Lists.
Recommend that the recomplete level TDP be defined on a task-by-task basis to ensure prototype efforts are timely and affordable.
RESPONSE:   Noted, will be defined with what level of data is required.
QUESTION: There appears to be a discrepancy between the Labor Category and Rates Table in Section L and the Labor Category Descriptions file. The table lists labor category G Software Engineer, while there is no labor category description.
RESPONSE:  The Labor Category Description file will be revised.
QUESTION:
FIRST TASK ORDER
Will we have access to an NGATS system software, in order to integrate the new hardware?
RESPONSE: Yes the software will be made available if required.
QUESTION: This should be covered by a general statement that it needs re-work.
RESPONSE:  The comment is unclear. Unable to provide a response.
QUESTION: For paragraph 4.14.1 (PWSFirstTask.doc):   Requires the contractor to supply an integration log book (CDRL A007) for the RF sub-system [at paragraph 4.14.2].  However, the description for CDRL A007 is for a TPS Integration Log book.  What is the Governments expectation for the content, format, etc of an RF Subsystem integration log book?
RESPONSE:  This is an error and will be corrected. The log book will be in contractor format and specified in the CDRL.
QUESTION: In Section 5.3.1 one of the future ATE Systems listed is ARGCS.  What is the role that ARGCS will play in the US Army Standard Family of Testers?
RESPONSE: The ARGCS was an evaluation/demonstration project. It will not be part of the IFTE family of Testers.
QUESTION: From the time of the Sources Sought, until now at Draft RFP, the EO/IR Hardware Requirements and the IRWindows Software requirements have been dropped.  Is it to be assumed there will be no EO/IR type activities implemented on this IDIQ?
RESPONSE:  The EO requirement has been put back into the basic PWS.
QUESTION: FIRST TASK ORDER
What type of Acceptance test will be required, for the first task? e.g.Will there be TPS's that need to be integrated with the RF subsystem.
RESPONSE: No. Functional testing to verify the subsystem meets the requirements. 10/03/12 IPT: Joe Cuccaro to review and provide a response. The first task will most likely be de-scoped to eliminate the prototype delivery.
QUESTION: It appears that an update is required for the data in the tables of paragraph 4.3.  For instance, frequency measurement inputs normally specify sensitivity (lowest measurable signal) as well as Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR).  Can we expect this appendix to be revised?
RESPONSE: All errors will be corrected in the final version
QUESTION: Why is a commitment letter for the basic PWS required, when no work will be awarded on the base?
RESPONSE: In conjunction with the resumes, letters of commitment from each person identified shall be provided documenting the Offeror's availability to begin performing this effort at the time of award. This is in accordance with Instructions to Offerors - Sections L and Evaluation Factors for Award - M Subfactor 2 (Personnel Knowledge and Experience).  The Government wants to ensure that the offeror has personnel available to support this effort as stated in the Performance Work Statement.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground - Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the U.S. Army Product Manager - Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment (PM-SCIE) has a requirement for an Individual Water Treatment Device (IWTD).  Soldiers conducting operations in isolated and rugged terrain must be able to use available local water sources when unable to re-supply from bulk drinking water or bottled water.  Therefore, the Warfighter needs the capability to purify water from indigenous water sources.  Soldiers must have the ability to remove microbiological contaminants in the water to EPA specified levels; thereby reducing the effects of acute debilitating illness.  The IWTD will enable the current and future force to maintain operational tempo, reduce the load bearing requirement and extend the operational force area of operations by maintaining hydration in the absence of fixed or large-scale, bulk portable water sources.  This is a pre-solicitation notice and not an RFP. <br>  <br> The Government anticipates a full and open RFP.  It is anticipated that a final Fedbizopps Announcement and solicitation will be released in early January 2013 with proposals due an estimated 30 days after release of the solicitation. <br>  <br> The Government anticipates awarding a 3-year, Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The NAICS Code is 333319 (Other Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing).  The Government reserves the right to make a single award, multiple awards or no awards as a result of this solicitation.  The minimum delivery requirement is for 100 IWTDs for each contract awardee.  The maximum delivery requirement is not to exceed 450,000 IWTDs or $45,000,000.00. <br>  <br> Funds will be obligated for quantities ordered upon issuance of delivery orders and not by the basic contract.  In accordance with FAR 15.306(a) (3), it is the intent of the Government to evaluate proposals and may award without discussions.  This is being procured IAW FAR Part 15. <br>  <br> When released, the solicitation, including all amendments and applicable documents (with the exception of patterns, if applicable) will be available in electronic medium from the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground - Natick Contracting Division at https://www3.natick.army.mil and through Federal Business Opportunities at https://www.fbo.gov. <br>  <br> NOTICE: All data contained herein is for information only and is subject to change.  In the event of discrepancy between the information shown on this web page and the actual solicitation documents, the actual solicitation documents and amendments thereto shall govern.

<DESC>Solicitation number: ED-IES-11-R-0036
<p>Title: Regional Educational Laboratories 2011-2016</p>
<p>The Department of Education (ED), Institute of Education Sciences (IES), National Center for Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance (NCEE), intends to award five-year contracts for each of the ten laboratory regions as specified in the Education Sciences and Reform Act (ESRA) of 2002, Part D, Section 174 (20 U.S.C. 9564) administered by the Institute of Education Sciences. As required by the authorizing legislation ED shall enter into contracts for a 5-year period.</p>
<p>The purpose is to enter into contracts with entities to establish a networked system of ten regional laboratories that serve the needs of each region of the United States.</p>
<p>The Regional Educational Laboratories (RELs) will carry out a range of activities to serve the needs of each region in the United States in accordance with the provisions stated in the Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA) of 2002 . These activities will include applied research, and development, dissemination, training, and technical assistance activities that focus on how to use data and analysis.</p>
<p>The primary mission of the RELs is to help states and districts systematically use data and analysis to answer important issues of policy and practice with the goal of improving student outcomes. Each REL will build research capacity and a knowledge base in states and districts by:<br /><br />(1) Assisting states, districts, and schools in using their data systems;<br />(2) Conducting and supporting high quality research and evaluation analyses that focus on a few key topics; and <br />(3) Helping education policy makers and practitioners incorporate data-based inquiry practices into regular decision-making. <br /><br />The RELs will carry out these priorities primarily by organizing partnerships or networks of practitioners, policy makers, and others in "research alliances." A research alliance is defined as a group of stakeholders (Local Education Agencies, State Education Agencies, and others) who agree to work together to use data to learn more about a specific education concern in order to make sound decisions to improve education outcomes. The structure, size, and focus of each alliance will reflect the needs of the region. RELs are encouraged to form regional, cross-state, or cross-district research alliances where appropriate, and/or to partner with existing alliances. Also, the RELs will conduct rigorous research and evaluation studies that may require 3 to 4 years to plan, implement, and prepare analytic report(s).</p>
<p>Expected Outcomes</p>
<p>The priority for the REL program and the mechanism for delivering REL services are intended to yield several important benefits for the regions and for the nation. These include:</p>
<p>&bull; Development of a cohesive and potentially deep body of knowledge in core, priority areas for each region and nationally, rather than spreading REL work thinly over many issues;<br />&bull; Increased use of evaluation, data, and analysis in how officials identify problems, choose programs and strategies, and learn from initiatives;<br />&bull; Completion of a range of rigorous evaluation and research studies, methodologically appropriate to the questions the studies attempt to answer; <br />&bull; Expansion of state and local capacity to use their own data, conduct high quality research and evaluation, and appropriately incorporate findings into policy and practice; <br />&bull; Distribution of REL work across the region, with a transparent and equitable process for REL assistance; and<br />&bull; Establishment of strong partnerships among practitioners, policy makers, and researchers that are not dependent on ongoing REL support.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be a Full and Open Competition. The NAICS codes used to define this procurement: This procurement is defined as code 541720 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). As such, the applicable Small Business Size Standard for this announcement is $7 million or less in annual receipts. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency. It is anticipated that ten contracts, with a period of performance of 5 years, will be awarded as a result of the RFP. The contract type is anticipated as Firm Fixed Price.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or about March 25, 2011 through the website at http://FedBizOpps.gov. All proposals must be submitted on or before the due date and time stated in the RFP to: Sharon Masciana, Contract Specialist, U.S. Department of Education, Potomac Center Plaza, OCFO/CAM, 550 12th Street, SW, 7th Floor, Washington, DC 20202-4230. The reference number to be used for the pre-solicitation announcement is: ED-IES-11-R-0036. All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided. Questions may be directed by email to Sharon Masciana, Contract Specialist, at Sharon.Masciana@ed.gov or telephone at 202-245-6132 or Pamela Bone, Contracting Officer at Pamela.Bone@ed.gov or by telephone at 202-245-6181.</p>

<DESC>UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT INSTRUMENT PROJECT (USIP) 2013 The NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) is releasing this Undergraduate Student Instrument Project (USIP) Educational Flight Opportunity (EFO) to solicit U.S. university proposals to develop an Earth or space science payload that will fly on a NASA suborbital vehicle, such as a sounding rocket, balloon, aircraft, or commercial suborbital reusable launch vehicle. SMD designed USIP to promote interest and proficiency in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and to develop careers in the STEM related fields through offering NASAs unique suborbital research platforms for student educational flight opportunities. This EFO is intended to provide multidiscipline undergraduate student teams an exciting hands-on project, while at the same time promoting the technical and project management skills necessary to train the countrys future science and technology leaders. The maximum funding available from SMD for a proposed project, including the design, development, and testing of the science payload, is $50K. The science payload funding may be supplemented with contributions by the implementing university; however, there are no expectations as to the amount of the university contributions. The university contribution is determined strictly by the university based on the universitys capabilities and the projects needs. The cost of payload integration with the suborbital vehicle and the launch/flight is provided by NASA at no cost to the university team. The selected projects must be launched or flight-ready within 13-16 months from the project initiation date. SMD expects to select approximately 15-20 projects, subject to available funding. The first goal of this USIP Educational Flight Opportunity is: To provide a hands-on flight project experience to enhance the science, technical, leadership, and project skills for the selected U.S. university undergraduate student team. The second goal of this solicitation is: To fly a science payload having a purpose relevant to the Science Mission Directorates science goals (http://nasascience.nasa.gov/	  ). This solicitation will be available on or about December 21, 2012, at the NASA Research Opportunities homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/	     and then linking through the menu listing "Solicitations" to "Open Solicitations."

<DESC>***Presolicitation Notice for Construction at National Institute of Standards and Tecnology, Gaithersburg MD***<br /><br />Background:&nbsp; Steam is produced at 150 psi by up to six steam generators located in the Steam and Chilled Water Generation Plant (4 nameplate-rated at 44,000 lb/hr and 2 rated at 80,000 lb/hr) at the NIST Gaithersburg, MD Campus. There are four (4) Union Iron Works boilers at 55MBtu/hr and two (2) English Boiler &amp; Tube, Inc. at 99.8 MBtu/hr currently installed and operational. All boilers are dual-fired for natural gas and No. 2 fuel oil. The four Union Iron Works boilers are original to the facility, installed in 1962, and are to be upgraded for this requirement. There have been several construction upgrades to the feedwater systems, condensate and fuel pumps, water treatment and other ancillary systems over the last 20 years, and a major project to replace and upgrade central plant controls was completed in April 2011. The NIST facility currently operates the heating plant under an MDE permit with an expiration date of April 30, 2013, and it is anticipated that compliance with stricter visible, NOx, and Sulfur Dioxide emission standards will be required for all future projects on Boilers 1-4.<br /><br />The owner seeks to improve the energy efficiency and air emission discharge performance of the existing Boilers 1 thru 4. The requirement is for the replacement of existing burners, forced draft fans, wind boxes, natural gas trains of Boilers 1-4 at the NIST Steam and Chilled Water Generation Plant with new Low NOx packaged burners, forced draft fans, wind boxes, natural gas trains and auxiliaries. The new burner/fan assemblies will feature state-of-the-art variable speed drives for FDF's, installation of economizers, and new electrical services and control devices. The design is planned such that all preparatory mechanical and electrical work can be performed during the summer months and each boiler can be isolated for the required demolition and new construction work without impacting normal Central Plant operations. Strict operational and coordination controls will be required to maintain facility capacity for steam generation at 80,000 lb/hour plus 100% boiler redundancy. <br /><br />***THIS PROCUREMENT&nbsp;WILL BE&nbsp;100% SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES*** <br /><br />The standard classification NAICS code is 236210 -- Industrial Building Construction. The small business size standard is $33.5 million. <br /><br />Interested vendors must be registered at SAM.gov (formerly CCR.gov) to be considered for award. <br /><br />The anticipated period of performance is 440 Calendar Days with specified construction phases that will sustain uninterrupted steam generation service throughout the project duration. Detailed specifications and drawings will be issued with the solicitation. <br /><br />Per FAR Subpart 36.2, the Government is required to disclose the magnitude of construction within a range.&nbsp; The estimated magnitude of construction for this project falls very close to two of the specified ranges.&nbsp; Depending upon the solution chosen by the offeror, the construction magnitude may fall in the range between $1M and $5M or in the range between $5M and $10M.
<p>Minority Businesses that seek assistance with bonding should contact MBDA - Minority Business Development Agency at www.MBDA.gov. Other Small Businesses should contact their Small Business Representative at the Small Business Administration.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract. Source selection will be based on a best value trade-off evaluation.<br /><br />The solicitation, solicitation amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. The solicitation is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about January 10th, 2013 and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site. Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site. Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.

<DESC><p>The Naval Research Laboratory has a need for a nominal 67 HP, 300 VDC submersible motor system consisting of a hydrostatic pressure compensated motor, controller/drive electronics, pressure housing to contain the drive electronics, and hydrostatic pressure tolerant cabling. It is required that the motor drive controller be enclosed in a pressure vessel capable of withstanding hydrostatic pressure ranging from 14 psia to 682 psia. All other equipment, external to the controller/drive electronics pressure housing, shall be capable of operating while withstanding hydrostatic pressure of 14 psia up to 10,014 psia. Electrical connections for power, feedback, and communication\control signals will be provided through appropriate SEACON connectors mounted on the waist of the pressure vessel. Other critical features include its efficiency at low and high power and its weight. The nominal voltage of the system is 300 V. The motor system will employ conductive cooling through the pressure vessel housing to ambient surrounding water. The volume of surrounding water will not have active flow around the pressure housing(s) of the motor or controller. The motor system will be capable of quiet operation and operating at or below the acoustic levels defined in the RFP. Standard MIL-SPECs will be applied for shock, EMI, environmental conditions, etc.</p>
<p>Complete technical specifications, quality assurance standards, and contract data requirements will be available as part of this solicitation. Specifications are export controlled under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). As such, to receive the referenced specifications, potential offerors will be required to submit a completed certification with proof of status as a U.S. person (as defined in 22 C.F.R. Part 120.15). Upon confirmation of eligibility, potential offerors will be sent a copy of the specifications. The specifications must be safeguarded and protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with applicable U.S. export control laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Based on a survey of the market, the government has determined that the services to be acquired do not meet the definition of a commercial item. Therefore, the government does not intend to use the procedures as outlined in FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.</p>
<p>NRL uses electronic commerce (EC) to issue requests for proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued.</p>

The contract will be performed in the area bounded generally by Massachusetts Avenue to the south, New Jersey and North Capitol Street to the west, and Q and R Streets to the north; it also extends eastward just beyond the CSX/Metrorail tracks. The intended source will be NoMa Business Improvement District (BID). The contract will provide for the following services:

Public space management;<br />4. Transportation;<br />5. Communications and planning coordination; and<br />6. Homeless services.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."

<DESC>T-38 Weapon System<br />Solicitation Number: <br />Agency: Department of the Air Force<br />Office: Air Force Materiel Command<br />Location: Hill AFB OO-ALC
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>The United States Air Force is planning an acquisition strategy for the follow-on production of the T-38 Rotor Disc Brake, NSN 1630013387124/Part Number 23820. The T-38 Rotor, Disc Brake requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source requires acquisition of the part from the approved source. The approved source retains data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. Therefore, this acquisition is for continued production of highly specialized components.</p>
<p>The T-38 Rotor, Disc Brake is used to help provide braking force to the aircraft. The rotors (multiple in each main wheel) are pressed together by the brake hydraulics to create friction on the brake pads. The brake pads are connected to the wheels so that the applied friction counters the spinning of the wheel. This causes the aircraft to have a braking force which is used to slow or stop the aircraft while on the ground.</p>
<p>The estimated award date is 18 MAR 2013 with performance expected up to 30 JUN 2014. First delivery of fully qualified production units is to begin within 3 months of award.

<DESC>Synopsis for Sustaining Engineering Services
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI). This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest for acquisition entitled E-3 Sustaining Engineering Services.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract (see FAR 15.201(e)). This Market Research and RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a RFP or IFB; an obligation from the U.S. Government to acquire any products or services; or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization. The government does not intend to reimburse respondents for information solicited. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the government to pursue any course of action described herein.</p>
<p>The E-3 System Program Office, Tinker AFB, OK is contemplating a SOLE SOURCE contract; the proposed acquisition is directed to The Boeing Company pursuant to 10 USC 2304(c )(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). The work content cannot be performed by any source other than Boeing without substantial and unacceptable programmatic risk, duplicative cost, and schedule delays. Only Boeing, the incumbent contractor has the necessary engineering data, data rights, manufacturing, and software knowledge and expertise to perform and manage multiple major sub system developments, hardware/software programs and related integration activities without unacceptable delay to program schedules and unnecessary duplication of sunk development costs which cannot be recouped via competition.</p>
<p>Boeing, as the current prime contractor for the Airborne Warning and Control<br />Systems Modernization and Sustainment Support contract, is the only qualified source to perform this sustainment effort within cost and schedule constraints. Furthermore, Boeing is the only source with the institutional technical knowledge that is critical for managing and integrating the completion of the ongoing development of the E-3 System. Boeing is the only source with the engineering, manufacturing, data rights, software and fielding experience and expertise to conduct, manage and integrate the multiple major sub system developments, site design/build activities and related integration efforts without resulting in unacceptable program delays and enormous duplication of costs that could not be recovered through competition. Duplication of prior development costs is unaffordable and would not be recoverable through competition for these requirements. There would be substantial schedule delays and costs for the government to re-validate and qualify models and ensure the necessary capabilities, data, and expertise/knowledge have been successfully transferred to any new system prime contractor. This would require collaborative participation of the offeror, Boeing and the government and would require Boeing to provide proprietary data to a new contractor for use in the re-validation process. It is highly improbable that other sources are available to duplicate the work already accomplished by the incumbent, to meet the Government's critical schedule requirements and not disrupt current system operational capability.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for work content for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent to award a sole source contract is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, as outlined above, which will be considered.</p>
<p>This is NOT a formal notice of solicitation. Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted.</p>
<p>There is no solicitation package available at this time. All interested parties should send company and/or descriptive literature along with responses to the following questions and any comments or questions to John W. Byrne, e-mail: John.Byrne@tinker.af.mil.</p>
<p>If you believe the government assumption of a Sole Source decision is incorrect and your firm possesses the technical capability, financial, facility, equipment and personnel resources, technical data/data rights, and relevant experience/past performance to perform the type of work specified above as a prime contractor, then the government requests you also submit all information stated below. If your anticipated participation will be that of a small business joint-venture, then you must identify each joint venture participant. If participation will be that of a newly formed small business joint venture, provide the information required by items 3 through 7 for each participant in the joint venture.</p>
<p>1. Company name and mailing address.</p>
<p>2. Point of contact (name, telephone number, and e-mail address).</p>
<p>3. Socio-economic status under the above stated NAICS (e.g., other than small business, small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, service disabled-veteran owned small business, etc.).</p>
<p>4. Current number of employees.</p>
<p>5. Identify the percentage of work that you, as a prime contractor, are capable of performing in each major technical function area (see above) for which you are capable.</p>
<p>6. Provide a brief summary of your company's experience and past performance within the past 3 years as a prime contractor as it relates to the magnitude of this anticipated requirement. Each experience provided (Government or commercial) shall include the following information: (a) name of project, (b) brief description of project, (c) contract or project number, (d) contract type, (e) client/customer point of contact (name, address, phone number, e-mail address), (f) dollar/ceiling value of the contract/project, (g) period of performance of the contract/project, (h) relevance of contract/project to requirements of this anticipated effort, (i) total number and magnitude of task orders (dollar value, duration, etc) awarded to you under the contract; and (j) total number (delineated by business size) of subcontractors/team members managed by you under the contract.</p>
<p>7. If you are a small business or joint venture of small businesses under the above NAICS, discuss how your firm will meet the requirements that at least 50% of the cost of contractor performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the small business prime contractor.</p>
<p>Responses to this request shall be limited to 30 pages or less, excluding coversheets and/or table of contents, and must be received by 4:00 p.m., 25 January 2013. Responses must be submitted both electronically and in hardcopy format. Hardcopy submissions shall consist of one original and three copies, and shall be forwarded to</p>
<p>AFLCMC/HBKKC<br />ATTN: John W. Byrne<br />3001 Staff Drive, STE 2AI86A<br />Tinker AFB OK 73145-3020</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought/Market Survey is to identify production sources for the Aircraft Flare Parachute LUU-19 B/B, NSN 1370-01-537-9304. FOB origin. First Article Test is required for new producers. Estimated date of issue: 15 Jan 2013, estimated opening date: 15 February 2012. It is anticipated that a one-time award will be generated as a result of this solicitation. Point of contact is: Julie Coughlin (309) 782-6139, e-mail: julie.a.coughlin.civ @mail.mil. <br>  <br> This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. The Government will utilize the information provided only to develop the acquisition strategy for future requirements. All information submitted will be held in a confidential status. <br>  <br> The Air Force and Navy use the LUU-19 B/B aircraft-launched flare for nighttime illumination of surface areas in search and attack operations.   The LUU-19 B/B is derived from the LUU-2 flare. The two flares are identical in form, fit and function, except the LUU-19 provides a near- infrared illumination requiring night-vision equipment to detect. This enables its use in covert target illumination and rescue operations. The LUU-19 weighs 36 lbs. It consists of four major components: the mechanical timer, the parachute suspension system, the Out-of Line Igniter (OLI), and the case assembly with cast candle. The illuminant candle composition and igniter are proprietary to ATK Launch Systems. The timer consists of a mechanical timer and related hardware enclosed in a lexan plastic housing. The mechanical timer is a verge type, three-gear timer, powered by a torsional mainspring. A phosphorescent plastic decal with calibrated markings to indicate the feet-of-fall prior to parachute deployment and flare functioning is located on the face of the timer cover. The decal has a SAFE position and timer settings from 250 to 11,000 feet-of-fall. Under the pointer portion of the timer knob, and as part of the knob, a flexible arm is located with a detent that will retain the knob in the recess next to the corresponding timer setting. The timer knob has a quick attach-detach spring operated latch which allows the lanyard loop to be connected to the knob. A pawl release mechanism retains the timer assembly in the flare housing. A mechanical destruct feature makes the timer inoperative after it is functioned. The parachute suspension system utilizes an 18-foot diameter cruciform shaped canopy for stability. Two riser cables connect the parachute to a bulkhead separating the parachute compartment from the remainder of the flare assembly. One cable is attached to an explosive bolt for parachute dump at candle burnout. The ignition system utilizes a lanyard that is attached to one of the parachute riser cables. The lanyard is threaded through the bulkhead and past the candle in an internal raceway along the side of the aluminum case leading to the ignition assembly in the ignition housing near the candle's face. The lanyard is attached to a triggering mechanism consisting of the Out-of-Line Igniter (OLI). The pyrotechnic firing train consists of a percussion primer, boron-potassium nitrate pellets, and a propellant wafer. <br>  <br> The technical data package (TDP) is classified as DISTRIBUTION D limited distribution. Distribution D means that the TDP cannot be distributed on the Internet. The TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, (Title 22, U.S.C., SEC 2751 ET SEQ) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended titled, 50 U.S.C. APP 2240 ET SEQ. Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. Disseminate IAW provision of DOD Directive 5230.25. Only the top level drawing will be provided for this market survey.  Offerors must be registered with the Joint Certification Program at the following web site: HTTP://WWW.DLIS.DLA.MIL/JCP/DEFAULT.ASP, in order to receive a copy of the top level drawing. After receipt of required certification, the contractor shall request a copy of the drawing via email from Julie.a.coughlin.civ@mail.mil. Request must include: CAGE code, company name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and point of contact. <br>  <br> After receipt and review of the top level drawing, interested companies should respond by providing the Government the following information: a brief summary of the company's capabilities (a description of facilities, personnel, and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria) and availability. Please indicate your business size in your response. Interested companies should provide minimum and maximum monthly production quantities.  Additionally, it is requested you provide the Minimum Procurement Quantity (MPQ) required for economical production. A respondent to this survey should be able to show adequate technical and manufacturing capability and good past performance in the pyrotechnics industry. A respondent to this market survey must have available a majority of the skills and facilities that are required to manufacture these items. If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate and should describe his ability to obtain those resources in a timely fashion. If a respondent chooses to utilize the services of sub-tier vendors or subcontractors, those vendors or subcontractors must also meet these criteria. The estimated quantity for this solicitation is approximately 4,850 ea LUU-19B/B Illumination Flares.  Interested companies should also include a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) unit price for this estimated quantity. <br>  <br> Interested parties have 15 calendar days from the date of this publication to submit information to be considered in the development of the acquisition strategy for this item. Any response to this market research should reference the following: LUU-19B/B Illumination Flare solicitation number W52P1J-13-R-0141.

The Government will not reimburse contractors or responders to this notice for any costs incurred in responding or in any subsequent exchange of information. The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of the market survey. The U.S. Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. All proprietary and restricted information shall be clearly marked. Any documentation provided will not be returned. All interested sources are invited to provide responses to the questionnaire. Please submit responses to the questionnaire electronically as one complete document in the questionnaire structure in a format chosen by the responder.
<p>Project Manager Tactical Radios is seeking industry comments and feedback to the draft Statement of Objectives, draft Statement of Work, draft Performance Requirements Document, draft Contract Data Requirements List, and questionnaire for Handheld, Manpack and Small Form Fit (HMS) Rifleman Radios (RR). The Rifleman Radio is to be a standalone radio to support controlled unclassified and classified real time intra-squad communications to be employed worldwide in both hostile and non-hostile environments and in a variety of terrain and climatic conditions. The radio will allow Soldiers to participate in doctrinal voice networks and transmit position location information via a networking waveform, the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW). <br />NO SOLICITATION EXISTS AT THIS TIME. It is currently anticipated that Solicitation W15P7T-12-R-0069 regarding this requirement will be released later in 1QFY13. Interested sources are encouraged to provide responses to the questionnaire below. The Government does not guarantee that questions received will be answered. Interested parties are invited to subscribe to the website to ensure they receive any important information updates connected with this RFI.</p>
<p>Questionnaire:</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Responses to this sources sought announcement will assist the Government in determining whether or not any future requirement(s) similar to this one should be set aside for small business or made available to full and open competition. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p><br />The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 811219 - Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance; Small Business Size Standard is $19.0 in millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Scientists at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Facility for Biotechnology Resources (FBR), are engaging in many aspects of biomedical research and conducting product reviews relevant to food and drug efficacy and safety. Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) manipulations including Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification of gene fragments, vector construction for gene expression, and mutagenesis of gene sequences are some of the routine tasks undertaken at CBER on a daily basis. These activities provide critical information for the identification of viral strains involved in seasonal flu, viruses or microorganisms causing diseases, or mutations that are responsible for certain phenotypes threatening the health and well being of humans. Most of these DNA manipulations require sequence confirmation via DNA sequencing. Staff at FBR assists scientists in DNA sequencing endeavors using two Applied Biosystem's (AB) genetic analyzers, models 3130 and 3500. These two instruments are used almost every day to serve the needs of CBER scientists' research projects. Both instruments produce valuable sequence information that allows scientists to bring their project to the next level or to modify experimental strategies for improvement. To ensure this high-volume work, annual preventive maintenance (PM) and timely repairs of these analyzers are required. The establishment of a PM agreement with a vendor that has knowledge of hardware and software and spare parts for these instruments, as well as technical expertise in problem diagnosis and instrument repair, is therefore required.</p>
<p>Statement of Work (SOW)/Performance Work Statement (PWS):</p>
<p>The FDA is soliciting quotes for a PM Agreement in support of the following two AB Genetic Analyzers:</p>
<p>&bull; AB 3500xL (serial # 22315-080)<br />&bull; AB 3130-16 (serial # 17214-012)</p>
<p>The PM Agreement is for a one (1)-year base period, plus three (3) one (1)-year option periods for each analyzer-to include the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance, support, and repair expertise with Genetic Analyzer hardware and software (specific expertise with AB 3130 and 3500 models preferred)<br />&bull; One pre-scheduled on-site PM and diagnostic servicing visit for each Genetic Analyzer performed by an OEM-certified field services technician; replace parts as necessary to maintain the equipment in conformity with factory and lab testing specifications<br />&bull; Manufacturer's approved parts<br />&bull; Technician travel<br />&bull; Labor<br />&bull; Priority for emergency on-site repair services (4-hour phone response, 48-hour on-site response preferred)<br />&bull; Software and firmware updates<br />&bull; Standard commercial warranty on parts and workmanship<br />&bull; Unlimited priority telephone/e-mail technical support Monday through Friday (normal operating hours - holidays excluded)</p>
<p>Interested Contractors must respond with capability statements to include information regarding the following: (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training/certifications; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information. References provided should be within the last three (3) years.</p>
<p>Potential contractors must indicate DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HUBZone, etc) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code.</p>
<p>Capability statements are due in person, by postal mail or email to the point of contact listed below on or before December 28, 2012, by 12:00 hours (Central Standard Time in Jefferson, Arkansas), at the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Acquisitions &amp; Grants Services, Attn: James "Scott" Rawls, 3900 NCTR Road, HFT-320, Jefferson, AR 72079-9502 or email james.rawls@fda.hhs.gov. Reference FDA1112388.</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>
<p>Confidentiality. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #632523; font-size: 14pt;">The Tongass National Forest seeks to construct at least one and up to three new detached single family residential houses in Yakutat, Alaska. These homes will be situated on Forest Service property at the Yakutat Ranger District Administrative Site, near the airport. Yakutat is located in the Gulf of Alaska about 200 miles north of Juneau, which is the nearest full service city. Yakutat is served by commercial airlines barge lines.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #632523; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #632523; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">We envision stick-framed construction built for local conditions and meeting the 2009 ICC family of codes, including compliance with the Alaska Building Energy Efficiency Standard (BEES). Modular (or prefabricated) construction is acceptable; manufactured housing is not. The buildings are to be 3-bedroom 2-bath homes with approximately 1600 square feet interior habitable space and an enclosed attached 600 sf 2-car garage. Roof extensions are required to form a minimum 5-ft covered walkway on two sides of the house for protection to and access around the house during heavy snow. Design approach may be utilitarian, with the exterior weather and thermal enclosure as the primary focus for quality of construction. Interior finishes are to be of durable quality, but utilitarian in terms of floor plan and aesthetic of finishes.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #632523; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #632523; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Yakutat is situated in a very wet and cold maritime climate which hampers conventional on-site stick framed construction methods. Access to the site is from the paved road through the administrative site. The successful contractor will also have responsibility for electric, on-site water, and on-site wastewater treatment systems, which are already designed and plans and specifications are available. The homes will have to be built on gravel pads, elevated from the ground level. Driveway pads are already built.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #632523; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: #632523; font-size: 14pt;">We envision a prime contractor (general contractor) taking complete responsibility for the project, which will include site preparation, construction of wastewater treatment system, connection to utilities, construction of foundation, construction of home (or installation of modular home), and finishing work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We hope to conduct the source selection during the winter, award the contract in the spring, and have work begin (and be completed if possible) in the summer of 2013. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #632523; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">This is a sources-sought notice. We invite all parties interested in this acquisition as a prime contractor (general contractor) to identify themselves by the submission of brief white papers. The Tongass National Forest will use the information in these white papers as we develop the acquisition strategy and prepare the solicitation. A white paper should be in Adobe (.pdf) format (please, not zipped and not exceeding 2MB in size) and submitted by e-mail to the contracting officer by 11am Alaska Standard Time on Friday, January 4, 2013 (use e-mail subject:&nbsp; White Paper/Yakutat Employee Housing). It should include the contractor&rsquo;s name, address, point of contact, DUNS number, small business size status under NAICS 236115, as well as a summary of similar projects performed by the contractor. We are very hopeful that prospective contractors submitting white papers will provide additional information that will be helpful to us as we prepare the acquisition strategy and solicitation approach, such as by providing recommendations or cautions. We wonder whether this acquisition should be set aside for small businesses (or HUBZone or service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses), whether the two-phase design-build procedures of FAR Subpart 36.6 are appropriate, what evaluation criteria we might use, whether oral presentations might be appropriate, what testing or inspection standards we should use, the feasibility of relying on already-designed modular homes and floor plan selections, appropriateness of NAICS 236115, and so forth.

<DESC><br />1. Synopsis
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for Market Research.</p>
<p>The National Technical Information Service (NTIS), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, is seeking assistance to determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses preferably of some sort of socio-economic category i.e., small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, service disabled veteran-owned or HUB Zone small businesses capable of serving the needs of NTIS.</p>
<p>2. Background</p>
<p>The National Technical Information Service (NTIS), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) is the official source for Government-sponsored U.S. and worldwide scientific, technical, engineering, and business-related information. NTIS may charge reasonable and justifiable service fees to other Government agencies for services performed (15 U.S.C. &sect;1151-&sect;1157, as amended). Through services to other agencies, NTIS helps recover its operating and modernization costs and remains self-sufficient, as required by law. In addition, section 3704b(e)(5), as amended, authorizes NTIS to implement new methods or media for the dissemination of scientific, technical, and engineering information, including producing and disseminating information products in electronic format.</p>
<p>The operations of NTIS includes on-line information delivery services and fee based subscription services accessible in various formats used by NTIS and other agencies to establish a presence on and disseminate information through the Internet, particularly the World Wide Web as a part of existence and growth in the archival and distribution arena of Government information.</p>
<p><br />3. Purpose</p>

The Contractor shall coordinate the format, transfer, and use of the file with NTIS technical staff. Storage boxes and locations shall be traceable at all times.</p>
<p>Boxes shall be arranged for transport in a manner that prevents damaging or other deterioration of boxes and files. Once relocated, boxes shall be stored on industrial shelving in a manner that prevents damaging or other deterioration of boxes and files. In addition, boxes shall be stored in a manner that permits expeditious retrieval of individual files and ease of access at such time as any such files and/or boxes may be retrieved by NTIS.</p>
<p>Contractor shall comply with Federal Government safety and security requirements. The contractor shall indicate preventive measures taken to safeguard the NTIS collection within the contractor's location, to include but is not limited to theft, loss of data, fire, and water damage.</p>

In the event of destruction of document files while in custody of Contractor, the Contractor shall be liable for all the costs associated with NTIS' reacquisition of such document files and records or facsimiles from whatever source and relocation to a storage facility of NTIS' choice.</p>
<p>The document files being stored at the Contractor's location are at all times the property of NTIS and at no time, shall NTIS or its agents be restricted from access or handling of the records boxes or files. Such boxes and files, as well as Contractor's storage facilities, shall be available during normal business hours for on-site inspections on either a scheduled or unscheduled basis.</p>

<DESC>Description: The NAVAL FACILITIES ENGINEERING AND EXPEDITIONARY WARFARE CENTER, PORT HUENEME is seeking information on Small Business sources that can provide engineering services, support services, and research support to the Risk-Based Explosives Safety Criteria Team (RBESCT)and Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board(DDESB) Science Panel. 

RBESCT Support - Research historical accident data and develop analytical procedures to quantify the probability of event for various operation types. This shall include any environmental or other factors that could increase or decrease the likelihood of a mishap. Additionally, the exposure algorithms shall be reviewed, and enhanced as needed within the context of the method.
 Also, a top-down assessment of the uncertainty model is to be performed, and an improved uncertainly method shall be generated using the most appropriate statistical assessment and probability distributions for the inputs.  Any and all changes to the algorithms and methods shall need to be updated, and all changes shall be incorporated into Technical Papers (TP) 19 and 14 with review and oversight from the RBESCT and the Services. Basic maintenance of these documents, the review process, and general operational support shall be required. Operational support shall include training of risk-based methods to various DoD personnel as directed by the RBESCT.

The DDESB Science Panel has conducted numerous explosives safety related tests over the past decade.
 Testing support is required, though the contractors will not be required to take the lead on running a test. Testing support includes data collection, drafting of test plans, data analysis, report generation, and interpretation of results. Ultimately, test data is used to updated the state of the art of explosives safety, and will be incorporated in criteria as appropriate.  DDESB Science Panel support shall also include support of meetings. Typically, there will be two or three in-person meetings per year, in addition to monthly telecons. Assignments will be as directed per task order, based on the TP 14 priority list as determined by the RESCT and DDESB Science Panel, as well as other explosives safety-related tasking.
 It is also required to provide support to the DDESB Science Panel in the Klotz Group, an international group of explosion produced debris experts, as well as the NATO Risk Analysis Working Group. These international forums represent bodies that develop explosives safety models, and implement them in manuals and criteria for operational use. Various explosives safety documentation, as outlined in Section 4, will require upkeep and maintenance at periodic intervals, which will required Science Panel support where needed.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT <br />For Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Chief Technology Office<br />For Information Volume &amp; Velocity (IV2)
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS:</p>
<p>DISA, Procurement Directorate (PLD), Defense Information Technology Contracting (DITCO)-NCR P.O.Box 549 Fort Meade Maryland, 20755.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION to determine the availability and technical capability of small businesses (including the following subsets, HUBZone Firms; Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses and Woman Owned Small Business) to provide the required products and/or services.</p>
<p>The DISA's Chief Technology Officer is seeking information for potential sources for Engineering support and a mobile application that consists of all the following: discovery, source types, media types, languages, parsing, scheduling, date slicing, image recognition, collection architecture, QA processes, audit alerts, logging, content ID's, recursive mining, and anonymization (proprietary global proxy integration) using open source technology, third party technology, loosely coupled architecture, interoperable, tech transfer, language translation, reporting, compliance, flexible discovery and collection.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: <br /><br />THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH (IAW) FAR 15.201 (e) RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCE SOUGHT ARE NOT OFFERS AND CANNOT BE ACCEPTED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR FORMING A BINDING CONTRACT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>CONTRACT/PROGRAM BACKGROUND: <br />This is a new requirement</p>
<p><br />Period of Performance (PoP): This is for a base period and four one year options.<br /><br />REQUIRED CAPABILITIES:</p>
<p>The Government requires contractor staff to assist with the operation, engineering, and development of the secure mobile application.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide staff with Top Secret and secret security clearances to ensure their ability to work in secure DISA facilities.</p>
<p>The contractor must provide the following functionality:</p>
<p>&bull; Discovery: The system must have the ability to automatically discover new content as it is created on the internet. The discovery engine should plug into hundreds of different source sites (i.e. major search engines, feed aggregators, etc...) leveraging the content that these companies have collected. The discovery engine has the ability to pull only the content that meets the search criteria of the client. Thereby providing the client with the ability to create highly relevant data streams from a wide variety of source sites. Once content is collected, the user can tune collection to do full site crawls of any domain. New discovery sources can be added within hours upon client request. This is an important aspect of the technology platform as new content sources are created almost weekly (i.e. new Mandarin search engine, foursquare).</p>
<p>&bull; Source types: Ability to collect any open source data including but not limited to mainstream media, social media blogs, forums, twitter, shopping, sharing, networking, photos, audio, video, etc... In short, the system can collect the entire open source intelligence market.</p>
<p>&bull; Media types: The system must be able to collect, parse and ingest nearly any media type in both open source and proprietary environments. (Text, html, video, audio, pdf, Microsoft office, email, etc...)</p>
<p>&bull; Languages: The system must have the capability to collect, parse &amp; ingest open source data in the multiple languages including but not limited to English, French, Arabic (Sudanese, Pashto, Urdu, Farsi) Somali, Bengali, Portuguese, Hindi, Russian, French, Japanese, Mandarin, etc...</p>
<p>&bull; Parsing: Open source technology to enable for parsing of documents in multiple formats (html, pdf, etc...) Ability to train staff to manage and upgrade parsing libraries as media sources change or are created over time. Ability to do highly complex parsing.</p>
<p>&bull; Scheduling: Crawlers shall be able to be scheduled to crawl based on end user requirements.</p>
<p>&bull; Date slicing: Within the discovery process, the system shall have the ability to use date slicing where appropriate. The search engines shall not cap search results at an arbitrary number (i.e. 500 or 1,000 posts). In the event that a discovery term brings back results from an engine that has capped results, the system must use a date slicing approach, whereby the search terms are run using a date filter on the search engine and collect data every day going back in time as far as the user desires. This will shorten the number of results returned by the engine and in most cases lead to complete collection coverage. In the instance where a discovery term is capped on a daily search, the application shall refine the discovery term into more targeted search, to ensure all content can be collected. These targeted terms shall be rolled back up in the system to a single agent, thereby providing consolidated results.</p>
<p>&bull; Image recognition: The system shall automatically recognize images within a piece of content and notifiy the developer and/or analyst. The system shall be configured to extract these images and send them to a team of analysts who can read and/or tag the images. The text and/or tag with the image, is embedded into the post and indexed. This shall ensure that an analyst can react to a potentially threatening piece of content embedded in an image and otherwise benign post. More importantly, this is the type of data issue that any system must be able to adjust to.</p>
<p>&bull; Collection architecture: Distributed collection architecture - from fetching to parsing to reporting, enabling the system to distribute work across tens of thousands of threads and associated boxes to achieve results in a fraction of the time of a linear process. Designed with built-in capacity for horizontal scaling - built on Linux leveraging cloud technology to offer high performance with relatively low-cost scalability.</p>
<p>&bull; QA processes: The scripts shall be designed smartly to report anywhere they have failure. They shall have suites of QA tools built that are specific to this application, which allow the system to ensure quality and accuracy of collected data. The system shall allow complete and total transparency into any and all collection issues. Each and every crawler shall be measured in the QA process based on the amount or types of historical data collected. This shall allow the system to automatically flag a spider that returns a data set that has a material change in historical collection. This eliminates the potential for rogue spiders and/or rogue data.</p>
<p>&bull; Audit Alerts: The system shall have a built in and configurable audit alert process that notifies a developer and/or analyst when a non normal event is identified in the collection process. This shall allow the developer to make fixes prior to data ingestion.</p>
<p>&bull; Logging: Every spider shall be tracked and logged at every stage of the development, testing and collection process. Every site and piece of parsed metadata shall be logged so a client can easily report on exactly what was collected, when it was collected and where it was collected. The logging shall be tied into a development platform that allows an administrator to see and track all development changes to a spider. This shall provide oversight on the development team.</p>
<p>&bull; Content ID's: Each spider and all associated content shall be tied to unique id's that enable an analyst and/or developer to easily remove content from the system and/or disable a crawler with no impact to the overall collection process. This shall provide the Government with the ability to easily remove content and/or disable collection in any area of the system with zero downtime.</p>
<p>&bull; Recursive mining: This system shall be designed to support recursive web mining which is the process of discovering and collecting content, parsing out key metadata attributes from the content and using those attributes as seed data for a new discovery search.</p>
<p>Anonymization</p>
<p>&bull; Proprietary global proxy integration: The system must be integrated with a global proxy network with capabilities to collect data in an anonymous manner. The proxy network have the following requirements:</p>
<p>o Collect data from a global network of proxy servers <br />o Route crawlers on demand through specific geo-locations as directed by end user <br />o Anonymously collect data from ssl sites <br />o Support crawling scheduler (i.e. when a crawler runs and how it behaves) <br />o Based on open source technology <br />o Shall be able to work on virtual server and/or cloud based environments<br />o Provide centralized application for routing traffic through proxy network as well as reporting all traffic incidents <br />o Stage honey pot proxies to collect information on sites that are trying to determine where collection is coming from<br />o Stage honey pot sites with dynamic content pulled from the web to misinform site operators as to the type of crawler collecting from their site. <br />&#61607; Eg: Creating of a blog search engine in Arabic that is fully functional, whereby anyone researching where crawlers are from will see that the site is a blog aggregator.<br />o This application shall work in conjunction with a collection infrastructure. Because as collection scales, IP's get blocked. So the more the collection system scales, the more the anonymization should scale along with it. <br />o Un-throttled access to a single site: This shall provide the Government with the ability to target up to tens of millions of queries per hour on a single site if necessary.</p>
<p>Technologies</p>
<p>&bull; Open source technology: The application shall leverage the latest in open source and highly distributed technologies. The technologies employed in the system shall include but not be limited to Python, Hadoop, Mapreduce, Solr, Mongo, etc.</p>
<p>&bull; Third party technology: The application shall have a modular architecture and shall have the ability to work with third party technologies such as Oracle, Autonomy, Microsoft, etc...</p>
<p>&bull; Loosely coupled architecture: The application shall be loosely coupled, providing the ability for a client to plug in third party or proprietary technologies at any point of the process. The end user shall be able to plug in at the appropriate module or component to meet their needs.</p>
<p>&bull; Interoperable: The application shall be interoperable with other legacy and/or emerging technologies at each module and/or component level. The interoperability shall ensure that as new technologies are developed, they can be readily integrated into the system.</p>
<p>&bull; Tech transfer: The application and/or any of its modules shall have the ability to be migrated to run behind the clients firewall. This shall enable to government to have control over the entire application.</p>
<p>&bull; Language translation: The application shall be able to integrate with third party language translation. The application shall provide the end user with the ability to convert discovery searches, search queries and/or document results from one language to another on demand. Open source language translation is preferred.</p>
<p>&bull; Reporting: The application shall provide transparent reporting across the entire process. The government must be able to report on any portion of the collection process in real time.</p>
<p>&bull; Compliance: The application shall be designed to provide custom compliance configuration dependent on the Government's objective. The Government shall be able to choose how the data will be viewed and what data the user wants to view.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>&bull; User profiles: The ability to extract user profiles from messages <br />&bull; Keywords/concepts: The ability to eliminate any content with specific words or phrases <br />&bull; Site: The ability to white list/black list content from specific sites <br />&bull; Source type: The ability to eliminate content from specific source types (i.e. video)</p>
<p>&bull; Flexible Discovery and Collection: Content shall be discovered and collected in a number of ways, including but not limited too <br />&bull; Topic (in any language)<br />&bull; Keyword/Concept (in any language) <br />&bull; Geographic region<br />&bull; Source sites <br />&bull; RSS feeds<br />&bull; Third party feeds and API's</p>

<a href="mailto:jason.m.carlock@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New Orleans</a>
<DESC> <br> The Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers, on behalf of the New Orleans District Corps of Engineers, is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) within the New Orleans District for the following project: <br>  <br> Hurricane Protection System, West Bank, Non-Federal Levee, NOV-NF-W-04a, Oakville to La Reussite, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana. <br>  <br> Project Description: The work consists of installing temporary access roads and traffic control, installing steel sheet piling, steel H-piling, constructing concrete T-wall, placement of compacted fill embankment, concrete slope pavement, and extending eight (8) existing seventy two (72) inch diameter discharge pipes. <br>  <br> Range of Magnitude: $25 to $100 Million. <br>  <br> Period of Performance: 912 calendar days after Notice to Proceed.  <br>  <br> Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are: <br>  <br> a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades. <br> b. The complexity of the project. <br> c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region. <br> d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time. <br> e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects. <br> f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects. <br> g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion. <br> h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive. <br>  <br> A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).  <br>  <br> Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br> a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will: <br>  <br> 1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br>  <br> 2. Be consistent with law. <br>  <br> Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions: <br>  <br> a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location by the New Orleans District? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a New Orleans District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA? <br>  <br> b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer? <br>  <br> c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area? <br>  <br> d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts? <br>  <br> e. Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade? <br>  <br> f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics. <br>  <br> g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? <br>  <br> h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project? <br>  <br> i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to meet small-business utilization goals? <br>  <br> Please provide your comments via e-mail to Jason M. Carlock, Contract Specialist at Jason.M.Carlock@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on 28 December 2012. <br>  <br> Agency/Contracting Office:  <br> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg District <br> ATTN: CEMVN-CT-C  <br> 4155 Clay Street <br> Vicksburg, MS 39183-3435 <br>  <br> Place of Performance: <br> New Orleans, Louisiana <br>  <br> Point of Contact: <br> Jason M.

<DESC>The Department of Interior, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) in Herndon, Virginia intends to negotiate and award a firm-fixed price purchase order to GE Aviation Systems LLC on behalf of the Republic of China (Taiwan) for Micro Cartridge Interface Devices (MicroCID).
The Taiwanese Air Force is procuring mission planning systems as part of an upgrade of their F-16 aircraft under the Department of Defense, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.  The requirement is for a total of twenty-two ( 22) MicroCIDs to support the loading of mission data to the aircraft.  In order for the U.S. government to fulfill the mission planning system requirement, it needs to obtain these devices from the manufacturer and only source, GE Aviation Systems LLC.
AQD will use procedures that provide for issuance of the order on the basis of other than full and open competition that are authorized by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) in Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2).  The supplies are highly specialized and market research indicates that the items appear to not be otherwise available to the government.   
This notice is not a formal solicitation. This is not considered a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposal (RFP). No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No purchase order will be awarded on the basis of quotation or offers received in response to this notice. Any response to this notice must show clear, compelling, and convincing evidence that competition will be advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the contract will be awarded without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 
Information related to the potential availability of other sources that can fulfill this requirement must be received by the POC listed below no later than 3PM eastern time on Thursday, 4 January 2013, POC: Chuck Spencer, Acquisition Services Directorate, 381 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 20170.

<SUBJECT>--Notice of Intent to Sole Source to PerkinElmer for Instrument Maintenance
<SOLNBR>EP-13-H-000122
<CONTACT>

<a href="mailto:Fisher.Trina@epa.gov">Fisher, Trina</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. for purchase of a One Year Repair Coverage Service Contract for three PerkinElmer instrument systems.
Scope and Capabilities: Repair Coverage Service Contracts are necessary to ensure that these four instruments are operating at their optimum performance, and to ensure that they are maintained in a safe condition.  The four instrument systems are: PerkinElmer Optima 5300 DV, serial # 077N5121301,  PerkinElmer Optima 5300 DV, serial # 077C8060201, PerkinElmer ElanDRCII, serial #Al12870707, and PekinElmer Series 200 Peltier oven, serial # OVP0910151912, Series 200 Quaternary pump, serial # 291N9101302A, Series 200 Autosampler, serial # 293N9100502A. The requirements for all four instrument systems on Repair Coverage Service Contract include: Service calls are given priority status over non-service agreement holders, all parts (excluding consumables), labor, and travel expenses of the field service engineer to maintain this instrument in normal working operation, and free telephone troubleshooting and technical support.  Additional Requirements for all four instrument systems on  Repair Coverage Service Contract include: Timely responses to service calls.  Service engineer(s) should be stationed locally in order to respond rapidly and minimize instrument down-time.  Initial service calls must be responded to within 24 hours and an on-site visit by the service engineer must occur within 48 hours;  Must be factory-trained and must stay up-to-date with PerkinElmer's instrument specific service bulletins;  Must be able to analyze the instrument specific software's failure log; and Must have extensive knowledge of the specific instrument software.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE  PerkinElmer is the company that manufactures the Optima 5300 DV, the Elan DRCII, and LC and is the best source of service for all these instruments. Performance issues are best known by the service engineers of the manufacturing company. In addition, this kind of information is distributed to PerkinElmer service engineers as a service data bulletin. Service engineers from PerkinElmer are more informed about any developing problems and the subsequent repairs or replacement parts needed in order to repair and improve these instruments as a result of their access to these service bulletins. A service provider other than PerkinElmer may not be able to readily access this information or even acquire any service issue updates relevant to the instrument. All PerkinElmer service engineers have access to applications specialists in their instrumentation area and are able to contact the design engineers for the specific instrument to d iscuss problems and find solutions. Open access to such specific application and design expertise would not be available through another service provider. Furthermore, PerkinElmer service engineers have extensive training in the instrument software systems. Since these instruments are now controlled by software commands, it is critical that a service provider have a complete understanding of the software. The software is essential in diagnosing instrument problems and has hidden areas for a trained service engineer to access in order to determine what problems have occurred with the instrument. Any other service provider not the manufacturer may not have complete knowledge of this software. Lastly, a rapid service response time is necessary for all of these instrument systems. PerkinElmer has a local service engineer with an excellent service response record making it unlikely that there would be excessive instrument down-time. Notwithstanding, any firm who believes it is ca pable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a response, which if received within 5 calendar days of the date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Trina Fisher via email to Fisher.Trina@epa.gov no later than 4:00 pm EST 5 calendar days after the date of this announcement. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.71 per hour or $148.40 per week or $643.07 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

This Statement of Work (SOW) is a comprehensive description of local exchange access services, analog and digital access transport services, and intra-Local Access Transport Area (LATA) interconnect functions the Air Force requires a Contractor to be technically capable of providing services in accordance with the SOW. Specific service requirements to be currently authorized will be identified in an Appendix 10 at the time the potential vendors are solicited for a specific requirement. For Air National Guard (ANG) and main bases locations the Contractor shall be facilities based either locally or by region and shall provide all transmission facilities, equipment, materials, maintenance, test equipment, and design layout needed to perform and provide local access and transport services and functions at the designated demarcation point. This includes the contractor's ability to install PRIs and the capability to port all currently existing DIDs and CSL(s) where applicable. These services shall include any special items, equipment, wiring or infrastructure to ensure the Contractor's proposed solution is compatible with the government's current infrastructure. For recruiter sites, the contractor has the option of porting the commercial number(s) or resale of the commercial services. The contractor is responsible for troubleshooting and maintaining the operation of the circuit up to its termination point. Access to the local exchange shall include: operator assistance, emergency 911/E911 services/ functions, circuits/trunks to base DMARC and 911/E911 database maintenance where applicable. These services shall not include residential/business services for non-Government entities or Government Contractors. Long distance services for each Site are currently being provided under the Federal Technology Services (FTS) contract or any subsequent follow-on contract established by DISA for long distance services and charges and are not authorized on this CSA. The contractor shall follow all Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Public Utility Commission (PUC), Department of Defense (DOD), Air Force (AF) and industry standards for this requirement. For Air Force recruiters and smaller AF sites, all of the applicable services will not be required particularly those sites that do not have an AF base telephone switch and are subject to standard commercial practices.. All references to the Appendix 10 in this Statement of Work will be identified at the time the requirement is established.</p>
<p>a. The definitions of the comprehensive set of services are described in this SOW even though these services may not be called out initially in an Appendix 10. These services may be ordered at a later date by the 38th authorizing the services, the site ordering them and the Contractor, when required, will have to provide the requested service(s) as defined below.</p>
<p>b. At the time of the requirement, the local provider currently providing the services will be identified or it will state if they are new services to be established.</p>
<p>c. At the time of the requirement, the base telephone switching system will be identified, in Appendix 10 defining the SWITCH MODE with the SOFTWARE MODEL software version, and where the switching system is located in Building NUMBER and street address.</p>
<p>1.0.2. Competitive Economic Advantage Consideration. The local exchange or Dial Central Office services provided for under the pricing, terms, and conditions of this contract are principally intended to meet known installation service requirements and an estimate of the type of services that may be required during the term of the contract. Where the contracting officer determines usage of the contract to be cost effective and the contractor providing such services to the Government agrees and has the additional capability to provide services to other installations or agencies within 100 miles of the principal place of performance, orders may be placed for such additional services. When an order is placed and the contractor initiates performance, all terms and conditions of this contract shall apply.</p>
<p>2.0. Documents. The contractor shall acquire a list of applicable industry standards that shall be followed in the performance of the contract. These documents shall be made available to the Government upon request.</p>

Point-to-Point Circuits. Refers to a connection restricted to two endpoints. A traditional point-to-point circuit is a communications medium with exactly two endpoints. The host equipment at either end has to take full responsibility for formatting the data transmitted between the two end points. Point to Point circuits will not extend beyond the LATA or state line boundary.<br />3.1.2.10. Bit Rate Interface (BRI) Circuits. BRI (128 - 256 - 384 ....512kb) and/or any circuit provisioning to include 1.54T-1 must meet the end equipment requirements for our base multi-functions to connect and operate at layer 1 and layer 2. Most circuits provisioned today come in 2-wire-line BRI (128kb each) - usually utilized for local video support. BRI traffic (as with any locally received commercial circuits) is sent out to our serviced customer on dry cable pair to the end-device. Past practices from local Telco, we receive new circuit on d-mark located at the main central office frame (MDF) - from there our techs will x-connect out to our cable plant and wire customer jack to RJ-45, RJ-48C as applicable. <br />3.1.2.11. Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS). The Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) is a White House-directed emergency phone service provided by the National Communications System (NCS) in the Cyber Security &amp; Communications Division, National Protection and Programs of the Department of Homeland Security. GETS supports Federal, State, local, and tribal government, industry, and non-governmental organization (NGO) personnel in performing their National Security and Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) missions. GETS provides emergency access and priority processing in the local and long distance segments of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). It is intended to be used in an emergency or crisis situation when the PSTN is congested and the probability of completing a call over normal or other alternate telecommunication means has significantly decreased. The servicing LEC must have NPA (710) in their switch to allow access to the GETS line assigned to a specific site. Dialing 0/1+710-NXX-XXXX provides access to an emergency service for authorized users. The 710 NPA provides access to a tariffed service of the GETS interexchange carriers (AT&amp;T, MCI WorldCom, and Sprint) and the call is billed to the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>NOTE - The Government does not provide the contractor to allow any 10-10 dial around access on awarded contracts.</p>

The Raven  (RQ-11B) and Puma - All Environment Capable Variant (RQ-20A) SUAS are managed by the SUAS PdO, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. The RQ-11B and RQ-20A are Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Targeting, Acquisition (RSTA) tools.  The systems transmit live airborne video images, compass headings and location information to a Ground Control Station (GCS) and to a RSTA Laptop Computer.  This capability enables operators to navigate, search for targets, recognize terrain, and record all information for analysis.  A system generally consists of the following basic components: Unmanned Aircraft (UAs); GCS; Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) Payloads; RSTA Computer Kit and Field Repair Kit.  An Initial Spares Package (ISP) is also fielded for support of the basic system.  The SUAS Product Office currently fields the RQ-11B and RQ-20A primarily to the Army, and also to other DoD and Civilian Government Organizations. The Army currently has fielded 1,798 RQ-11B systems and 325 RQ-20A systems and has a requirement to sustain and maintain this existing fleet. The Army has met 92% of the RQ-11B Army Acquisition Objective (AAO), and has met 83% of the anticipated need for RQ-20A (required by USFOR-A-issued JUONS). Additionally, the current fleet has pre-planned spiral upgrades such as the Gimbal payload, which will be competed and retrofitted under this effort. The need exists to complete the AAO; maintain, sustain and upgrade the fleet; and procure future SUAS Systems as required by DoD, Other Government Agencies (OGA) and foreign countries. While the current systems fielded are the RQ-11B and the RQ-20A, alternative Medium and Long Range SUA systems may be procured to meet the anticipated future requirement of approximately 300 Medium and approximately 150 Long Range SUA systems with spare/repair parts. Additionally SUAS PdO must maintain the capability to support current and future Warfighter needs for SUAS systems in CONUS and OCONUS. Due to the inherit flexibility required for future purchase quantities; multi-award, Firm Fixed-Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts are most appropriate to support this effort. Offerors shall provide a standard one year commercial warranty as outlined in the RFP requirements. For this solicitation, all items required must be new, fully functional, present, and compatible as required by the SOW.<br>Solicitation and Attachments <br>**The full RFP with attachments shall be posted on Natick Contracting Division's Business Opportunity Portal at: http://www3.natick.army.mil/busopps.html<br><br>Question Submission: Interested offerors must submit any questions concerning the solicitation IAW the instructions within the RFP.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br><br>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br><br>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br>Point of Contact(s): <br>Brian P.

(35FB9) P/N 202388-1. Based on market research this item is a commercial item and will be solicited using FAR Part 12 procedures. The delivery schedule requires a quantity of 1018 kits to be shipped to (W25G1U) New Cumberland, PA 17070-5001 within 90 days, but phased schedules to begin earlier are encouraged. FOB destination and inspection at Destination is required. This solicitation will be available on the Internet at http://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/rfp after the issue date of 12/21/12. Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set-aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in US dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer. The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307<br />

POC: 760-360-3693. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.

PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

POC: SFC Jason Zahnley 760-380-3693 <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

POC: CPT Voll/MAJ Moon steven.moon1@us.army.mil or 760-380-5015. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated.

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES: Please review the solicitation document for clause changes. Please note that all vendors submitting an offer under this Solicitation must be registered in the System For Award Management (SAM) website. The SAM website can be accessed https://www.sam.gov.

As such, the NIDS platform is configured with preferentially attached (i.e. orchestrated) antibodies to facilitate the capture of analytes (in solution) that have been introduced to the assay via the sample well.</span></p>

<DESC>The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a U.S. Government corporation whose mission is to provide assistance that will support economic growth and poverty reduction in carefully selected developing countries that demonstrate a commitment to just and democratic governance, economic freedom, and investments in their citizenry. MCC's approach to development assistance is innovative, partnership-based involving substantial resources and a high degree of consultation with a sharp focus on achieving measurable results with U.S. taxpayer resources. For more information on the MCC, please visit www.mcc.gov.
<p>The contract will be for a Personal Services Contractor (PSC). A personal services contract is different from the usual non-personal services Government contract, which establishes an independent contract relationship. Under a non-personal services contract, the contractor or employees of the contractor are subject to the technical direction but not the supervision of the MCC. As defined by FAR 37.104, a personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor personnel. Thus, the PSC is subject to the relatively continuous technical direction, supervision, and control of the MCC. PSCs may be assigned inherently governmental duties (FAR 7.502). By law and by the terms of their personal services contract, the PSC is subject to most of the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the direct hire employee such as MCC regulations, conflict of interest, under some circumstances MCC authorized employment security clearances, and financial disclosure. However, under the MCC personal services contract authority, PSCs are not employees for purposes of laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). <br />The following elements apply to this contact:<br />(1) Performance on site. <br />(2) Principal tools and equipment furnished by the Government. <br />(3) Services are applied directly to the integral effort of agencies or an organizational subpart in furtherance of assigned function or mission. <br />(4) Comparable services, meeting comparable needs, are performed in the same or similar agencies using civil service personnel. <br />(5) The need for the type of service provided can reasonably be expected to last beyond 1 year. <br />(6) The inherent nature of the service, or the manner in which it is provided, reasonably requires directly or indirectly, Government direction or supervision of contractor employees in order to- <br />(i) Adequately protect the Government's interest;<br />(ii) Retain control of the function involved; or <br />(iii) Retain full personal responsibility for the function supported in a duly authorized Federal officer or employee.</p>
<p>MCC seeks a Deputy Resident Country Director (DRCD) locally resident in Praia, Cape Verde. The individual selected will be hired full-time under a personal services contract through Washington, DC headquarters. MCC, by design, has a lean presence on the ground but a high degree of responsibility for large programs that are implemented by partner countries. As a result, members of MCC's small Mission staff will need to be highly-skilled, flexible, able to create structure from the ground up, have very sound and skilled independent judgment, and be tolerant of pressure and change. MCC Compacts are limited to five years and it is preferred that team members have the ability to make a multi-year commitment. Incumbent's pay grade and compensation level are based on the following: proven leadership and management skills; professional experience and past performance; job knowledge, skills and abilities; assigned level, scope and extent of responsibility; and education and training.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: This contract shall be awarded solely to an individual(s), not to a firm. The individual must have an active DUNS # and a fully approved &amp; active www.sam.gov record at the time of contracting.</p>

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />(xv) 52.246-16 Responsibility for Supplies (Apr 1984)<br />(a) Title to supplies furnished under this contract shall pass to the Government upon formal acceptance, regardless of when or where the Government takes physical possession, unless the contract specifically provides for earlier passage of title.<br />(b) Unless the contract specifically provides otherwise, risk of loss of or damage to supplies shall remain with the Contractor until, and shall pass to the Government upon --<br />(1) Delivery of the supplies to a carrier, if transportation is f.o.b. origin; or<br />(2) Acceptance by the Government or delivery of the supplies to the Government at the destination specified in the contract, whichever is later, if transportation is f.o.b. destination.<br />(c) Paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply to supplies that so fail to conform to contract requirements as to give a right of rejection. The risk of loss of or damage to such nonconforming supplies remains with the Contractor until cure or acceptance. After cure or acceptance, paragraph (b) of this section shall apply.<br />(d) Under paragraph (b) of this section, the Contractor shall not be liable for loss of or damage to supplies caused by the negligence of officers, agents, or employees of the Government acting within the scope of their employment.<br />(End of Clause)<br />(xviii) 52.247-34 F.o.b.

The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial, or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including "piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item 568 of the National Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight." When supplies meeting the requirements of the referenced Item 568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments, the contractor shall ensure that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to complete delivery to consignee.<br />(b) The Contractor shall --<br />(1)<br />(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or<br />(ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements;<br />(2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading;<br />(3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the contract;<br />(4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the contract;<br />(5) Furnish a delivery schedule and designate the mode of delivering carrier; and<br />(6) Pay and bear all charges to the specified point of delivery.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>FACTOR 1 - PAST PERFORMANCE:<br />The offeror shall identify at least two (2) relevant (construction, overhaul, repair and alteration of ships) and current federal, state or local government or private contracts performed during the last three (3) years. For each contract, list:</p>
<p>a. Contract number and customer point of contact (including two (2) points of contact <br />With telephone numbers)<br />b. Dollar value of the contract (Original and Final)<br />c.

<p>If subcontracting arrangement is proposed, the above data must also be provided for each first tier subcontractor. If a joint effort or teaming arrangement is proposed, highlight previous experience with the proposed team or subcontractor.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a)(2) Past Performance Evaluation. The Contractor's past performance will be evaluated according to the following factors and questions: <br />- Quality of Product or Service<br />Did the customer get what was specified?<br />Did the customer consider the final product high in quality?<br />If warranty issues arose, were they promptly corrected?<br />- Schedule<br />Was the contract completed on time? If not, reason why not (growth work, Contractor delayed, government delayed?)<br />- Business Relations<br />How was the customer service? Was the Contractor committed to customer satisfaction?<br />Would you use this company again (Why/Why not)?<br />- Management of Key Personnel<br />Were subcontracts involved? Comments?</p>
<p>In evaluating Contractors past performance, the government intends to also review U.S. Coast Guard Contractor Performance Assessment Reports and other existing past performance ratings on relevant contracts. General trends in a Contractor's performance will also be considered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - PRICE:</p>
<p>Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>****Past Performance is significantly more important than Price****</p>
<p>Award may be made without any type of discussions or negotiations. This is based on the Contracting Officer's determination after an evaluation has been completed on all offers. <br />(End of FAR 52.212-2)</p>
<p>FAR 52.215-20 Requirements for Cost or Pricing Data or Information Other Than Cost or Pricing Data (OCT 2010) ALT IV <br />(a) Submission of cost or pricing data is not required<br />(b) If the contracting officer cannot determine price reasonableness either in the initial solicitation or in any change to the contract after award, the contracting officer will require submission information in sufficient detail in order to make such determination. <br />The information may be as follows: <br />REQUEST FOR INFORMAL COST BREAKDOWN<br />In addition to placing your offer in the appropriate place in Schedule of supplies and Prices, it is requested that you provide a breakdown of your costs, to include but not be limited to, those items identified in the sample format below:<br />Trade, (i.e. laborers, rigger, etc.)<br />Breakdown of labor grades by trade category<br />Manhours per trade, per labor grade<br />Cost/hour/trade<br />Supplies/materials (description &amp; cost of each)<br />Sub-total<br />Pension Plans<br />Overhead at a rate of ______%<br />Profit at a rate of ________%<br />Total for item _____________<br />FAR 52.217-7 Option for Increased Quantity - Separately Priced Line Item (MAR 1989) - VARIATION</p>
<p>The Government may require the performance of the numbered line items, identified in the Schedule as option items, at the unit prices stated in the Schedule. The option quantities shown in the Schedule are estimates only. The Government has the right to require performance of these items at the quantities deemed necessary. Therefore, the Government may exercise an option item on more than one occasion during the contract performance period. The Contracting Officer will provide initial notification of the exercise of an option either verbally, by facsimile, or both. When time is of essence initial notification will be provided verbally followed within 24 hours by a facsimile of confirmation. A contract modification will be executed shortly thereafter to include those options wherein exercise notification was provided. Such options may be exercised at any phase during the contract performance period as stated herein, or any extension of the performance period. To maintain the contract performance period the Contractor shall commence performance of an option item immediately upon receiving initial notification; but, not later than 24 hours thereafter, unless proper sequencing of the work requires a delay in beginning performance of the option. In that case, the option item shall be commenced as soon as proper sequencing permits. The exercise of any option item listed in the Schedule will not normally extend the contract performance period. However, the Contracting Officer may consider a request by the Contractor for contract extension if an option is exercised after 50% of the contract performance period has expired.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

As with all environmental regulations, it is the Contractor's responsibility to research, prepare for, and comply with, the local and state regulations.</p>
<p>All waste generated under the performance of this contract shall be disposed under ISC Boston's EPA hazardous waste generator ID number. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) 24 hours prior to any waste removals, and ensure that waste removals are conducted during normal business hours (0800-1600) on Monday through Friday (excluding holidays).

The point of contact for environmental issues is the Environmental Protection Specialist at ISC Boston (617)223-3387.</p>
<p>VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) REGULATIONS<br />(a) Contractors are required to comply with federal, state and local VOC compliance laws and regulations. Among other requirements, certain Contractors may also be required to operate pursuant to a Title V permit. The need for such a permit will depend on the provisions of the applicable state's "State Implementation Plan" (SIP) and the type/quantity of the Contractor's regulated emissions, including VOCs. Certain SIPs may also mandate certain Contractors to operate under the terms of a compliance plan intended to reduce VOC emissions.</p>
<p>(b) Contractors, therefore, must submit the following to the designated Port Engineer not later than two weeks after contract award: <br />1) Copies of any federal, state or local permits required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places;<br />2) Copies of any compliance plans required and applicable to the use or application of VOCs at Contractor's facility or offsite work places.</p>

<p>GROWTH WORK<br />(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an SFLC 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.<br /><br />DISCOVERIES AND CHANGES TO CONTRACT<br />Work requests can be transmitted electronically by using email. The bullets below display the process of how work requests are to be followed during an availability:</p>
<p>Work Request Process will occur in the following order:<br />1. Condition Found Report-Generated by the contractor and provided to COTR<br />2. Condition Report Reply-Generated by the COTR and provided to Contractor<br />3. Work Request- WR and IGE are generated by the COTR and forwarded to KO<br />4. COTR provides copy of Work Request to the Contractor<br />5. Contractor's Proposal- Provided to the KO for the identified tasking on WR<br />6. Negotiations- If needed, take place to establish pricing<br />7. Approved Work Request- Forwarded to Contractor and COTR by the KO<br />8. Modification to Contract- The KS/KO will issue a modification covering all WR's</p>
<p>COMPOSITE LABOR RATE<br />The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the Prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the Prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>

<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY<br />No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION<br />The U.S. Coast Guard Surface Forces Logistic Center (SFLC) will monitor and evaluate the successful offeror's past performance of this contract and prepare a Contractor Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) in accordance with FAR Part 42.15. All information contained in this assessment may be used, within the limitations of FAR 42.15, by the government for future source selections and in accordance with FAR 15.304, when past performance is an evaluation factor for award.</p>
<p>(b) NOTIFICATION: Upon completion of the contract, the contractor will be notified of the assessment. The contractor will be allowed 30 days to respond to the SLFC's assessment of its performance entered into CPARS.

The Contractor may invoice each contract line item (CLIN) as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule of Supplies/Services as follows:</p>
<p>A CLIN may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that CLIN have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each CLIN may be waived by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar CLINS.)</p>

<p>All payments for partial performance rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the Contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the Prime Contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The Contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend progress payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subcontract agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified by the designated billing office and signed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as accurate and complete.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>QUESTION / ANSWER
<p>With regard to ATTACHMENT 1 Description of Terahertz Measurement System:</p>
<p>1. The salient characteristics document states, "It is also used to perform tests of S-parameters (CW and pulsed), Noise figure, Gain compression, Intermodulation and harmonic distortion, Conversion gain/loss, True-differential stimulus, Millimeter-wave Material measurements, Signal integrity and Antennas. The instrument must be able to perform measurements in both the Frequency and Time-Domains." Does this solicitation require all options and accessories necessary to support the tests listed in this statement or should the product offers be capable of supporting these test with the necessary hardware and software upgrades?</p>
<p>Requires all options and accessories.</p>
<p>2. The salient characteristics document states, "It must provide IF Inputs." Will offerings that support antenna measurements without the use of IF Inputs be considered?</p>
<p>No.<br /><br />3. The salient characteristics document states, "It must have a minimum display of 10.4" diagonal color active matrix LCD; 1024x768 resolution." Is this a firm requirement as it appears that only one supplier can meet this requirement?</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-59.  The associated NAICS code is 336411 and the small business size standard is1500 employees. Proposals MUST be good for 360 calendar days after close of proposal period. The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) is applicable and assigned rating is DO-A1. <br><br>The date, time and place offers are due is 4:30PM Eastern Standard Time (EST),  <br>27 SEP 12 to:<br>Brian P. Murphy<br>13501 Ingenuity Drive, Suite 200<br> Orlando, FL 32826<br>Brian.p.murphy52.civ@mail.mil<br>Office: 407-384-5198<br><br>The Product Demonstration documents are due: NLT 3:30PM Central Standard Time (CST), 12 September 2012 to: <br>Product Manager, Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems<br>Attention: Major Jeffrey Poquette, Bldg 5300 Sparkman Center, <br>Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898<br>Jeffrey.Poquette@PeoAvn.Army.Mil<br>Mobile phone 256-842-7266<br>This Solicitation is for the full spectrum of Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) and Parts required supporting the SUAS Product Office (PdO) in CONUS and OCONUS, and its domestic and foreign customers. The Raven  (RQ-11B) and Puma - All Environment Capable Variant (RQ-20A) SUAS are managed by the SUAS PdO, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. The RQ-11B and RQ-20A are Reconnaissance, Surveillance, Targeting, Acquisition (RSTA) tools.  The systems transmit live airborne video images, compass headings and location information to a Ground Control Station (GCS) and to a RSTA Laptop Computer.  This capability enables operators to navigate, search for targets, recognize terrain, and record all information for analysis.  A system generally consists of the following basic components: Unmanned Aircraft (UAs); GCS; Electro-Optic/Infrared (EO/IR) Payloads; RSTA Computer Kit and Field Repair Kit.  An Initial Spares Package (ISP) is also fielded for support of the basic system.  The SUAS Product Office currently fields the RQ-11B and RQ-20A primarily to the Army, and also to other DoD and Civilian Government Organizations. The Army currently has fielded 1,798 RQ-11B systems and 325 RQ-20A systems and has a requirement to sustain and maintain this existing fleet. The Army has met 92% of the RQ-11B Army Acquisition Objective (AAO), and has met 83% of the anticipated need for RQ-20A (required by USFOR-A-issued JUONS). Additionally, the current fleet has pre-planned spiral upgrades such as the Gimbal payload, which will be competed and retrofitted under this effort. The need exists to complete the AAO; maintain, sustain and upgrade the fleet; and procure future SUAS Systems as required by DoD, Other Government Agencies (OGA) and foreign countries. While the current systems fielded are the RQ-11B and the RQ-20A, alternative Medium and Long Range SUA systems may be procured to meet the anticipated future requirement of approximately 300 Medium and approximately 150 Long Range SUA systems with spare/repair parts. Additionally SUAS PdO must maintain the capability to support current and future Warfighter needs for SUAS systems in CONUS and OCONUS. Due to the inherit flexibility required for future purchase quantities; multi-award, Firm Fixed-Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts are most appropriate to support this effort. Offerors shall provide a standard one year commercial warranty as outlined in the RFP requirements. For this solicitation, all items required must be new, fully functional, present, and compatible as required by the SOW.<br>Solicitation and Attachments <br>**The full RFP with attachments shall be posted on Natick Contracting Division's Business Opportunity Portal at: http://www3.natick.army.mil/busopps.html<br><br>Question Submission: Interested offerors must submit any questions concerning the solicitation IAW the instructions within the RFP. Questions not received IAW the RFP instructions may not be considered.<br><br>The contract Period of Performance (PoP) is five years with a Base Period of three years, and 2 one-year option periods.  CLINS 0001-0087 are applicable to the Base Period, CLINS 1001-10087 apply to the first option period, and CLINS 2001-2087 apply to the last option. The full list of contract line item number(s) and items, quantities and units of measure, including option(s) are found in addendum section section B of this RFP document. See the RFP for a full description of requirements to be acquired. Specific date(s) and place(s) of delivery, acceptance and FOB point will be specified in the individual Delivery orders. The multiple IDIQ contract awards are currently scheduled for December 2012, and shall have a cumulative ceiling of $248M for all orders.<br>The selected offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - the selected offeror must submit a completed copy of the listed representations and certifications; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, paragraph (a) and the addendum clauses listed in the RFP.

The Government also reserves the right to increase and decrease the Period of Performance dates due to mission requirement. In the event this happens, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractors within 12-24 hours to make adjustments accordingly. <br>The Full and Open competition award decision is based on evaluation factors that are tailored to the acquisition. Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: TECHNICAL, #2 PAST PERFORMANCE, #3: PRICE #3: SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION PLAN The Technical Factor is more important than Past Performance. Past Performance is more important than Price & Price is more important that Small Business Participation Plan. When combined, all non-priced factors are more important than the price factor.<br> Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br><br>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br><br>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br>Point of Contact(s): <br>Brian P.

Fedbid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest directly with the Contracting Officer responsible for this acquisition should review the procedures at FAR Part 33 and send your protest to LTC Douglas Lowrey, at douglas.lowrey@us.army.mil . Interested parties wishing to file an agency protest must abide by the provisions in FAR Part 33, Protests, Disputes, and Appeals.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527; Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>In accordance with DFARS 252.232-7003, "Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports", the contractor shall submit their payment request electronically using the WAWF.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

In the Solicitation on page 3 and 4, ITEM NOs 0001, 1001, 1002, and <br> 1003, there are references in each ITEM to a  quote mark Section A Price quote mark  and a <br>  quote mark Section B Price quote mark . Under the  quote mark Section A Price quote mark  description it describes <br>  quote mark Transponder access on a Geo-stationary satellite with CONUS coverage area <br> for a 12 month option period beginning on 12 JAN 2014 and ending 11 JAN <br> 2015 quote mark . Under the  quote mark Section B Price quote mark  it describes  quote mark Satellite supported <br> internet service for each remote First Responder Kit via the contractor <br> provided Satellite Hub for an option period of 12 months beginning on 12 JAN <br> 2014 and ending 11 JAN 2015. quote mark  Is the intention to have the bandwidth <br> described as  quote mark Section A Price quote mark  used on the government owned hub and the <br> bandwidth described as  quote mark Section B Price quote mark  utilized on a contractor provided <br> hub?  <br>  <br> All ITEM NOs 0001, 1001, 1002, and 1003 are all for the First responder section. 0001 is for a base line quote, 1001 is for a one year quote (basically same as 0001), 1002 is a quote for a 2 year term and 1003 is for a 3 year term. We want to see how much savings there is for a longer term contract if any at all. <br>  <br> Q.     In the SOW it is mentioned that there is a Government owned satellite <br> hub, and also that  quote mark The provider satellite shall support for the PAARNG's <br> iDirect Evolution Satellite Hub and iDirect Evolution 8000 series remote <br> VSATs quote mark .  If the government owns a hub and is seeking a contractor to provide <br> 2Mhz of dedicated satellite capacity on a private satellite network which <br> includes the Government-owned hub and the remote VSATs that are supported by <br> the hub, what is the reason for also seeking individual monthly services on <br> a contractor's satellite hub for each remote VSAT? <br>  <br> There are 2 separate systems involved here. The Government owned Evolution Hub and VSATS only need the 2MHz of space. The First responder kits need everything else.  <br>  <br>   <br> Q.     If the 2Mhz of 24/7 non preempt able satellite transponder capacity is <br> not to be used to support the remote VSATs, what is the 2Mhz of 24/7 <br> non preempt able satellite transponder capacity to be used for?  <br>  <br>  <br>  Yes it is to support the Evolution VSATs and Hub not the First responder kits.  <br>  <br>    <br>  POC is SSG Brian C.

<p>Solicitation Number: H92222-12-R-0059<br />Notice Type: Solicitation/Request for Proposal<br />Classification Code: R - Professional, administrative, and management support services<br />NAICS Code: 541 - Professional, Scientific, and Technical Service<br />541930 - Translation and Interpretation Services<br />Synopsis: DISCLAIMER - The Request for Proposal was preceded by a DRAFT RFP posted on FBO 17 October 2012.</p>
<p>CLOSING DATE: 25 January 2013</p>
<p>This is a formal Request for Proposal (RFP). USSOCOM is seeking proposals from sources that can provide foreign language interpretation, transcription, reporting, and translation services (NAICS Code 541930) in support of various units worldwide.<br />This is solicited and will be awarded on a Full and Open Competition basis.<br />Attached to this RFP are documents available via an Explicit Access request. To gain Explicit Access to this information, Contractor Personnel must be categorized within FBO with the proper NAICS Code for this requirement. This precaution has been established to limit the dissemination of sensitive unclassified information. To gain access to all of the Unclassified Explicit Access documents (with the exception of the CLASSIFIED documents), please request via this FBO posting. NOTE: Vendor's who received Explicit Access for the DRAFT RFP stage MUST requests access again as the documents have been updated.</p>
<p>To gain Restricted Access to the CLASSIFIED documents, Contractor Personnel must be approved by DSS (and confirmed by USSOCOM) to store CLASSIFIED material up to the TOP SECRET Level. All interested vendors shall submit DSS documentation that approves the storage of CLASSIFIED material (to include ship-to address)and the individual(s) requesting such material shall have current/valid Security Clearances (documentation needs to be provided as well). Providing complete packages/copies of all documentation is required. Incomplete packages, pending, or in-process documentation/clearances will NOT be accepted in part or full. ALL interested Offerors shall have this in place as of the closing date of this formal RFP date. Under no circumstance will interested Prime Contractor Offerors be able to utilize a potential Sub-Contractor's Classified Storage capability as proof of classified storage capability.<br />NOTE: For those vendors who submitted documentation during the DRAFT phase of this RFP, MUST RESUBMIT documents for this formal RFP as well. Repeat, all vendors must RESUBMIT their facility's ability to store CLASSIFIED material up to the TOP SECRET Level, as well as personal security clearances.</p>

A prerequisite to this requirement is that all interested vendors that wish to propose for the Prime Contractor role MUST demonstrate DSS approved CLASSIFIED Storage Capability and Individual Security Clearances. Failure to do so will cause the Proposal to be rejected, and will not be evaluated further, and therefore not eligible for award. <br />Upon successful confirmation of clearances and storage capability, USSOCOM will mail all CLASSIFIED documents to the approved physical ship-to address location of the interested vendor, after DSS Facility Clearance has been verified with USSOCOM Security.</p>
<p><br />**Questions regarding this RFP must be emailed (in writing) and submitted to the Contracting Officer (addresses below).

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Deputy Country Representative is a member of the Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Middle East (ME) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Country Representative or designee, and is based in Turkey.  There may be substantial travel to countries in the region if/when conditions allow.  <br /> <br />The Deputy Country Representative's principal responsibility is to support the OTI Country Representative in the development, oversight, and management of the DCHA/OTI Syria country program.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Deputy Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Deputy Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Deputy Country Representative requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The Deputy Country Representative is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Deputy Country Representative is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The Deputy Country Representative has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Deputy Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the OTI Country Representative, the Deputy Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Represent OTI interests during meetings with USAID Mission personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, host-country government officials, international organizations, indigenous and international NGOS, international donors, and others interested in DCHA/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide continued guidance on the identification and development of projects that meet OTI funding criteria, further OTI programmatic objectives, and complement other projects and programs implemented by other OTI offices as well as with USG agencies and donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Evaluate proposals and work with diverse groups-many of which have not previously had international funding;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in monitoring the performance of the OTI implementing partners in the implementation of OTI-financed activities designed to achieve OTI strategic objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	If required, travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop activity ideas;</p>
<p>&bull;	Mentor/train other OTI and implementing partner field staff as required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Take the lead on collecting information and drafting/ editing regular reporting products;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, assume higher representational responsibilities, potentially serving as acting OTI Country Representative in his/her absence, for example;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist in developing an exit strategy in coordination with the OTI Country Representative that ensures reasonable time to transition from OTI programs to follow-on USAID or other donor programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	As appropriate, communicate regularly and share program information with other USAID project managers, the US Embassy, bilateral donors, UN Organizations, International Organizations, and indigenous and international NGOs to ensure visibility and synergy of USAID/OTI activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support the Country Representative to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, report regularly to the OTI Country Representative and OTI/Washington on the status of: 1) grant development and implementation; 2) OTI contractor performance; 3) Foreign Service National (FSN) staff support needs and morale; 4) communication and coordination issues among OTI offices with other USG entities; 5) security concerns; 6) relations with local partners, including local, state and national government representatives; and 7) other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist the Country Representative in managing and/or supervising the Foreign Service National Staff, including but not limited to program officers, administrative assistants, and drivers;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff as delegated by the Country Representative (e.g. Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Admin Assistants, etc.).  Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests; and,</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor or OTI Regional Team Leader to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Deputy Country Representative will report to OTI's Country Representative or designee in the designated country.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes.  Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the Supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Assessment teams or during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>While in Turkey, the work is generally performed in an office environment.  However, the position also requires travel throughout the region, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/working-crises-and-conflict/promoting-peaceful-political-transitions</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Country Representative is a member of the Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Middle East (ME) Regional Team, reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader, and is based in Turkey.  There may be substantial travel to countries in the region if/when conditions allow.</p>
<p>The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Syria country program.  The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this position is to ensure that OTI has a highly-qualified Country Representative in the field that will represent OTI and fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility.  As a member of a highly visible and rapid response office, the Country Representative requires a willingness and ability to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.  The Country Representative is highly flexible and the working conditions are subject to ongoing change(s), while maintaining a professional and respectful conduct towards colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce.  S/he places a premium on the building positive relationships with his/her respective team, with the rest of OTI and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The Country Representative is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, while also assisting a busy supervisor and fellow colleagues to track and respond to incoming requests and routine tasks, filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.  The Country Representative has a strong sense of responsibility, service-oriented, highly organized, pays close attention to detail, is able to complete administrative tasks with minimal guidance, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner.  The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Middle East (ME), the Country Representative will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy.  When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs, where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate and coordinate OTI in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, mentor and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff, providing regular feedback;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees) ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on implementing partner performance, the appropriateness of the partner's scope to OTI's country objectives, partner's budgets, and modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract, in accordance with the USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS);</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, Ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international NGOs, and other pertinent agencies and organizations.  Develop and maintain collaborative relationships with them in order to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government, as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g.  Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Program Admin Assistants, etc.).  Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests; and,</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Country Representative will report to OTI's Washington-based Team Leader for Middle East (ME), or his/her designee, as well as to the Chief of Mission or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives.  The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished.  Work plans, timesheets, regional travel, and funding associated with support costs will be approved through OTI Washington.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes.  Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the Supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>
<p>10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Assessment teams or during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>
<p>11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>While in Turkey, the work is generally performed in an office environment.  However, the position also requires travel throughout the region, which may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>W15QKN-12-R-E013					W15QKN-13-R-E013 <br>  <br> QUESTION: Reference - The posting for RFP W15QKN-12-R-E013 indicates that the contract will be for the acquisition of Commercial Services with incidental supplies  The PWS for T0 0001 indicates that satisfactory completion cannot be achieved without designing, testing and delivering an RF Subsystem that meets a detailed set of requirements.  Is the RF Subsystem an incidental supply item or is T0 0001 a fixed price supply task order for a commercial item? <br> RESPONSE: The contract allows for the delivery of material and hardware. This item is considered hardware. <br> QUESTION: Is there any Proprietary Data associated with the NGATS RF Microwave Frequency Support? <br> RESPONSE: There is no proprietary data associated with this task. <br> QUESTION: Para 4.3.1 of the TASK01 PWS states shall support all current and future requirements <br> Recommend above wording be changed to the following: shall support all current and known future requirements <br> RESPONSE:  We would like the system to be robust enough to support future technologies. The contractors should analyze what the industry roadmaps are and plan for growth of their design to support these technologies. <br> QUESTION: Para 4.3.1.1 of the TASK01 PWS states shall assure all current and future systems are addressed. <br> Recommend above wording be changed to the following: shall assure all current and known future systems are addressed. <br> RESPONSE: We would like the system to be robust enough to support future technologies. The contractors should analyze what the industry roadmaps are and plan for growth of their design to support these technologies. <br> QUESTION: Para 4.23.1 of the TASK01 PWS states All data delivered to the Government shall be unlimited. All markings contrary to this and existing in the TDP shall be removed before delivery. <br> Recommend above wording be changed to the following: The Government shall have unlimited rights to data that is developed under this contract. <br> RESPONSE:   Noted. The wording is not changed. <br> QUESTION: <br> BASIC PWS Para 4.3.2 states The contractor shall develop test stations that conform to DoD standards for ATS, support open architecture, utilize state of the art technologies, contain no proprietary hardware/software, and utilize commercial off the shelf instruments to the greatest extent possible. <br> Recommend above wording be changed as follows: The contractor shall develop test stations that conform to DoD standards for ATS, support open architecture, utilize state of the art technologies, contain no proprietary hardware/software to the greatest extent possible, and utilize commercial off the shelf instruments to the greatest extent possible. <br> RESPONSE:   Proprietary information is not to be submitted. The wording will not be changed. <br> QUESTION: <br> TASK 01 PWS Paragraph 4.20.1 states One complete set of technical data suitable for recomplete for the all prototype hardware shall be delivered. The design of the hardware product baseline shall be documented through the use of engineering data. The TDP shall conform to data item description, DI-SESS-8100D (CDRL A008), Product Drawings/Models and Associated Lists. <br> Recommend that the recomplete level TDP be defined on a task-by-task basis to ensure prototype efforts are timely and affordable. <br> RESPONSE:   Noted, will be defined with what level of data is required. <br> QUESTION: There appears to be a discrepancy between the Labor Category and Rates Table in Section L and the Labor Category Descriptions file. The table lists labor category G Software Engineer, while there is no labor category description. <br> RESPONSE:  The Labor Category Description file will be revised. <br> QUESTION: <br> FIRST TASK ORDER <br> Will we have access to an NGATS system software, in order to integrate the new hardware? <br> RESPONSE: Yes the software will be made available if required. <br> QUESTION: This should be covered by a general statement that it needs re-work. <br> RESPONSE:  The comment is unclear. Unable to provide a response. <br> QUESTION: For paragraph 4.14.1 (PWSFirstTask.doc):   Requires the contractor to supply an integration log book (CDRL A007) for the RF sub-system [at paragraph 4.14.2].  However, the description for CDRL A007 is for a TPS Integration Log book.  What is the Governments expectation for the content, format, etc of an RF Subsystem integration log book? <br> RESPONSE:  This is an error and will be corrected. The log book will be in contractor format and specified in the CDRL. <br> QUESTION: In Section 5.3.1 one of the future ATE Systems listed is ARGCS.  What is the role that ARGCS will play in the US Army Standard Family of Testers? <br> RESPONSE: The ARGCS was an evaluation/demonstration project. It will not be part of the IFTE family of Testers. <br> QUESTION: From the time of the Sources Sought, until now at Draft RFP, the EO/IR Hardware Requirements and the IRWindows Software requirements have been dropped.  Is it to be assumed there will be no EO/IR type activities implemented on this IDIQ? <br> RESPONSE:  The EO requirement has been put back into the basic PWS. <br> QUESTION: FIRST TASK ORDER <br> What type of Acceptance test will be required, for the first task? e.g.Will there be TPS's that need to be integrated with the RF subsystem. <br> RESPONSE: No. Functional testing to verify the subsystem meets the requirements. 10/03/12 IPT: Joe Cuccaro to review and provide a response. The first task will most likely be de-scoped to eliminate the prototype delivery. <br> QUESTION: It appears that an update is required for the data in the tables of paragraph 4.3.  For instance, frequency measurement inputs normally specify sensitivity (lowest measurable signal) as well as Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR).  Can we expect this appendix to be revised? <br> RESPONSE: All errors will be corrected in the final version <br> QUESTION: Why is a commitment letter for the basic PWS required, when no work will be awarded on the base? <br> RESPONSE: In conjunction with the resumes, letters of commitment from each person identified shall be provided documenting the Offeror's availability to begin performing this effort at the time of award. This is in accordance with Instructions to Offerors - Sections L and Evaluation Factors for Award - M Subfactor 2 (Personnel Knowledge and Experience).  The Government wants to ensure that the offeror has personnel available to support this effort as stated in the Performance Work Statement.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the response date from 14 Jan 2013 to 12 Feb 2013 <br>  <br> 1.  Synopsis.    <br>    <br>  The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI) or Sources Sought Announcement (SSA), or to otherwise pay for the information requested.  Your response will be treated as information only.  This RFI/SSA shall not be considered as an invitation for bids, request for quotations, or a Request for Proposals (RFP).  It shall not be used as a proposal.  This RFI/SSA is issued for the purpose of conducting pre-solicitation planning and market research to determine production capabilities for the procurement of the counterfire target acquisition radar (AN/TPQ-53) system including training in support of OCONUS tasks.  This RFI/SSA is a market research tool to determine potential sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a RFP.  <br>    <br>  This RFI/SSA is being issued to satisfy a requirement of the February 2012 Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM) which required Product Manager Radars (PM Radars) to conduct market research to ascertain industry's ability and interest in satisfying AN/TPQ-53 production requirements.  The information gained from the RFI/SSA will be used to support development of a business case analysis which assesses the feasibility of reintroducing competition for FRP in FY14.  It is the intent of this RFI/SSA to accomplish the following four objectives:  <br>    <br>  a.  Conduct market research to determine interested sources capable of producing and delivering AN/TPQ-53 FRP assets.  <br>    <br>  b.  Obtain information from interested sources on their radar technology capabilities and abilities to meet the specifications of the AN/TPQ-53 system.  Capability statements will not be utilized for any purpose other than for market research.   <br>    <br>  c.  Obtain information from interested sources on their production and manufacturing capabilities to meet system requirements within the proposed acquisition timeline.  <br>    <br>  d.  Request capability statements to assist in developing a procurement strategy to meet the U.S. Army Counterfire Target Acquisition Radar needs.  <br>    <br>  2.  Introduction.  <br>     <br>  a.  Program Description.  The U.S. Army PM Radars and the U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) have a requirement for the FRP assets of the AN/TPQ-53.    <br>    <br>  The AN/TPQ-53 radar system will serve as the Army's replacement for the AN/TPQ-36 and 37 radars.  The AN/TPQ-53 system capability shall satisfy known current and future force concept requirements by interfacing with the global information grid and future force battle command systems.  The enhanced capabilities of this radar will provide the Warfighter with continuous and responsive counter-battery target acquisition for all types and phases of military operations.  The AN/TPQ-53 is a highly mobile radar system that will detect projectiles in-flight, as well as determine and communicate the firing point location of rockets, artillery and mortar (RAM).  It will be deployable and capable of operation in varying terrain and climatic conditions.  The system shall provide both 90 and 360 degree azimuth detection coverage against all threats at increased ranges, enhanced human machine interface, ease of programmability, and built-in capacity for growth.  It also will accurately locate and classify hostile weapon locations at greater ranges and coverage patterns to permit more effective detection and counter-battery fires.   <br>    <br>  b.  Program Background and Procurement History.  Current and future forces have a critical and immediate need for a RAM locating system that provides 360 degree detection coverage to mitigate capability gaps in force protection and target detection.  Current indirect fire detection systems lack the mobility and agility to meet the requirements of the supported force and are too large and slow to support units in all types of military operations.  Brigade combat teams and Fires Brigades must quickly secure the operational area and the current counterfire systems introduce unnecessary risk to operations.  <br>    <br>  In 2006, the government awarded a contract to Lockheed Martin following full and open competition.  This contract provided for the design of the AN/TPQ-53 radar and the purchase of four radars.  Twelve additional radars were purchased under the same contract in response to a directed procurement in July 2008.  The Army Acquisition Executive approved the acquisition of up to 20 radars.  Seventeen of the 20 were purchased via letter contract in April 2010.  Three additional assets were procured in August 2011.  On 29 February 2012, the government competitively awarded a firm fixed price contract (W15P7T-12-C-C015) for procurement of up to 54 low rate initial production assets and spares.  The table below provides procurement history information.    <br>    <br>  Contract Number	Award Date	Contractor	Extent Competed/Authority  <br>  W15P7T-06-C-T004	26 Sep 06	Lockheed Martin	Competed  <br>  W15P7T-06-C-T004	25 Jul 08	Lockheed Martin	Option Award (FAR 17.2)  <br>  W15P7T-06-C-T004	12 Apr 10	Lockheed Martin	Letter Contract; award of 17 systems as part of an undefinitized contract action (UCA) (FAR 16.302-1)  <br>  W15P7T-06-C-T004	11 Aug 11	Lockheed Martin	UCA Definitization; award of 3 systems (FAR 16.302-1)  <br>  W15P7T-12-C-C015	29 Feb 12	Lockheed Martin	Competed  <br>    <br>     <br>  3.  Full Rate Production Acquisition Approach.   <br>    <br>  a.  Acquisition/Procurement Strategy Planning Information.  The FRP contract will be a single award, firm fixed price (FFP) contract comprised of a base year, with multiple separately priced options and range quantities.  Spares, new equipment training, and technical manuals will also be acquired on a FFP basis.  The contract will include cost plus fixed fee provisions for services.  The scope of cost plus efforts will include, but not be limited to:  operations; maintenance and repair; interim contractor support; test support; studies and analysis; field support representatives; threat support upgrade; software maintenance and updates; technology insertion and fielding support.  PM Radars anticipates release of the solicitation in fourth quarter fiscal year 2013 (4QFY13), with an anticipated award date of 3QFY14.    <br>    <br>  b.  FRP Requirements.  All AN/TPQ-53 Performance Work Statement (PWS) and Performance Specification requirements will be stated in performance based terms.  Proposed systems are required to be production ready upon contract award.  PM Radars plans to structure contract requirements to ensure industry has the flexibility to employ existing manufacturing and management processes.  Industry will further have the flexibility to propose and use facilities, plants and processes, which are the same as they use for commercial production.   <br>    <br>  PM Radars anticipates contract award in 3QFY14.  AN/TPQ-53 FRP is planned to commence in FY 14.  If all options are exercised, production of approximately 70 systems is planned for from FY14 to FY18.   <br>  The government estimates a production quantity range between 12-25 systems per year.  As currently planned, a key factor of the source selection process will include a Live Ammunition System Demonstration (LASD).  The demonstration is planned to take place during first and second quarter FY14 and would require contractors to provide a production representative system for demonstration to a LASD test plan, PWS and Performance Specification of the system.  LASD results will be used to evaluate the risk(s) of achieving the required performance within the specified schedule and demonstration of production readiness of the system.  <br>    <br>  Production systems will utilize the Army's family of medium tactical vehicles (FMTV) with the long term armor strategy (LTAS) armored cab as the prime mover of the system.  It is intended that the FMTV LTAS will be provided as government furnished equipment (GFE) upon award of the production contract.    <br>    <br>  Other key objectives of the FRP contract and the AN/TPQ-53 radar program are to reduce operational support and life cycle sustainment costs of the radar system, while ensuring the program is delivering the best technologies and most effective capabilities to the Warfighter.  <br>    <br>  A copy of the draft Performance Specification, as well as a copy of FMTV LTAS technical data package, will be made available to interested parties upon request.   <br>    <br>  4.  Request for Information.   <br>    <br>  The government is interested in receiving information from industry on the aforementioned proposed Acquisition Strategy; your company's radar technology capabilities and the ability to meet the AN/TPQ-53 radars system specifications; technology innovations; your production and manufacturing capabilities to meet system requirements within the planned production timeline;  identification of cost drivers; recommended milestone schedule for accomplishing production requirements, training in support of OCONUS; and any other information that may be relevant.  This will enable the government to assess an appropriate acquisition strategy and your company's ability to meet the requirements and specifications of the system.  <br>  Responses should include the following pieces of information at a minimum:  <br>    <br>  a.  State whether or not your firm is interested in participating as the prime contractor or as a subcontractor on the AN/TPQ-53 FRP contract.  <br>    <br>  b.  Contractors responding to this notice with their interest as a prime contractor should confirm they possess the technology, design and production capabilities to meet the specified requirements.   <br>    <br>  c.  If contractor is a small business and you are interested in participating as the prime contractor, provide how you plan on meeting the limitations on subcontracting per FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.   <br>    <br>  d.  Provide your company's capabilities and abilities to meet the requirements and performance specifications of the radar system; to include providing information on any current systems in development, systems planned for development or current fielded systems to meet the requirements and performance specifications of the AN/TPQ-53 system.   <br>    <br>  e.   Provide capability statement with supporting detailed technical, logistical and managerial back-up data to demonstrate parts of the requirement in which interest lies in. Also indicate whether item(s) or service of interest will be manufactured and/or performed in the Continental United States (CONUS) or Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) and if so, specify location of production facility.  <br>    <br>  f.  If you do not currently have the capabilities to meet the performance specifications and requirements of the system, provide what would be required, and your company's approach to meet the specification requirements of the system in terms of technology and development efforts, time required to meet specification requirements, and the impacts to meeting the production schedule.   <br>    <br>  g.  Address your company's production and manufacturing capabilities to the following:       <br>      <br>  (1)  Describe and provide the length of time after contract award production representative systems will be available for testing.  <br>  (2)  Describe and provide the number of radar systems (production rate) your company is capable of producing on a monthly basis.  <br>  (3)  Describe and provide the number of months after contract award that this production rate could be achieved.  <br>    <br>  h.  Address your ability to provide a system for the LASD within the time frame indicated (first and second quarter FY14), as well as your capacity to demonstrate your proposed system solution has a technology readiness level (TRL) greater than or equal to 8 (TRL 8).  <br>    <br>  i.  Please identify what the government can realistically expect your company to   <br>  provide at LASD.  How many assets would your company be able to provide to support the event?  How much lead time would your company require to effectively support this event?  To what degree could these assets be expected to comply with the technical performance requirements in the draft AN/TPQ 53 Production Specification?  Will your asset be fully integrated onto the objective prime mover identified in the AN/TPQ53 Production Specification at the start of LASD?  What limitations would the government have to accept regarding your technical performance at LASD?  What are the risks and how can they be mitigated?   <br>     <br>  j.  Provide your innovative thoughts, comments, approach on key elements of sustainment; and approach and or recommendations on reducing sustainment and overarching life cycle support costs (hardware/software) of the program.  <br>    <br>  k.  Identify any efficiency that you believe would lead to additional cost savings for the acquisition, while maintaining a quality system and meeting system performance specifications.  <br>    <br>  l.  Provide your thoughts and describe potential partner/teaming arrangements or joint ventures to meet AN/TPQ-53 requirements.  <br>    <br>  m.

<DESC>REVISION 1 TO EXTEND DUE DATE FOR WHITE PAPERS TO 2:00 PM, EASTERN TIME ON WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 23, 2013
The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the BSEE Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program on Safety of Oil and Gas Operations in the US Outer Continental Shelf.  When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistently with prior research.  For a summary of TA&R research recently performed, visit http://bsee.gov/Research-and-Training/Operational-Safety-and-Engineering.aspx.  Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting white papers.
BACKGROUND:   
The BSEE TA&R Program is requesting white papers to be submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement. Selected white papers will be requested to submit proposals.  Proposals selected for funding by BSEE shall receive funding from FY 2013.  NOTICE:  The BSEE may share the White Papers with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors shall notify the BSEE if they do not want their White Papers/proposals shared outside of BSEE.  BSEE anticipates awards resultant to this announcement will be made on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis. 
OBJECTIVES: The topics for the FY 2013 safety research funding should be limited to the following topics: 
1. Physical oceanographic and meteorological data for Beaufort and Chukchi Seas to support reliability-based design criteria for arctic offshore oil and gas structures.  
Conduct extensive literature search for physical oceanographic and meteorological data associated with the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas and compile identified data into a framework that aids in developing robust statistical samples needed for describing environmental loads to support reliability-based design criteria for arctic offshore structures and associated marine infrastructure.  This work is intended to support current and future efforts in design of arctic offshore structures utilizing reliability-based engineering and international standards such as ISO 19906 Petroleum and Natural Gas Industries - Arctic Offshore Structures.
2. Reliability-Based Sea-Ice Parameters for Design of Offshore Structures Evaluate existing Beaufort and Chukchi sea-ice data (e.g. data from ice thickness studies, ice strength studies, seasonal freeze-up studies, etc.) and synthesize data in to the statistical values needed for reliability-based engineering design of robust arctic offshore structures that provide high reliability to withstanding ice forces (statistically low probability of failure).  This work is intended to support current and future efforts in design of arctic offshore structures utilizing reliability-based engineering and international standards such as ISO 19906 Petroleum and Natural Gas Industries - Arctic Offshore Structures.
3. Workshop offering a venue for consultation between experts collecting and utilizing physical oceanographic and meteorological data
Plan, organize, promote, and host a 3-day workshop offering a venue for consultation between experts collecting and utilizing physical oceanographic and meteorological data in support of Arctic Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) research pertaining to the physical environment of the Chukchi Sea.  This Workshop is intended to support collaborative discussions necessary to (1) determine the scope, format, and methods of collection of accumulated data; (2) develop a framework for integrating and analyzing this data to support decisions on OCS oil and gas operations; and (3) identify data gaps and opportunities for collaboratively gathering additional data.      4. Assessment of Unmanned Aerial System/Vehicle (UAS/V) technologies for application in sea ice reconnaissance and data acquisition. 
Assess UAS/V technologies for application in monitoring and measuring significant ice features in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas.  As hazardous ice can pose a significant threat to arctic oil and gas operations, UAS/V reconnaissance and associated monitoring of identified features may provide a viable alternative to manned reconnaissance flights and provide an additional tool to be used in concert with other ice monitoring systems (MDA RadarSat 2 imagery, MODIS satellite, IceNav images, field observations, etc.).  Measurement of ice feature geometry can provide useful data for assessing ice feature properties and provide information necessary to support design criteria for future arctic offshore structures.
5. Assessment of subsea glider technologies for application in mapping ice keel geometries, ice gouge geometries, subsea pipeline surveillance, and under ice oil accumulations.
Assess subsea glider technologies for application in measuring/mapping the sub-surface geometry of significant ice features and associated sea floor gouges from grounded ice features.  Measurement of ice feature sub-sea geometry can provide useful data for assessing the properties of significant ice features and provide information necessary to support design criteria for future arctic offshore structures.  Further, subsea glider technologies may provide a mechanism to survey subsea arctic pipelines for potential leaks, as well as look for under ice oil accumulations from undetected leaks.  
HOW TO RESPOND: White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORIGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format, on a CD, shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, Acquisition Operations Branch, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN: Mr. Frank Bennett, not later than 2:00 PM, Eastern Time on Wednesday, January 23, 2013.  WHITE PAPERS SENT THROUGH EMAIL AND FAXES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  White Papers shall define the proposed research scope and include the level of effort.  NOTE THAT COST ESTIMATES ARE NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE WHITE PAPER.  The White Papers shall be evaluated only on technical merits.  IF YOUR WHITE PAPER IS SELECTED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION, A TECHNICAL AND COST/BUSINESS PROPOSAL WILL BE REQUESTED FROM YOUR COMPANY BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  Projects shall be selected from all or part of the technical issues listed depending on the interest and scope of White Papers received.  BSEE shall evaluate the responses, and those deemed to have merit shall be furnished information to assist in the preparation of the complete proposal.  This announcement constitutes a Request for White Papers, but does not obligate the Government to consummate award.  Respondents WILL NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation on the information submitted. 
WHITE PAPERS SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: (1) feasibility of the approach or solution; (2) the Offerors understanding of the technical issues; (3) the Offerors ability to implement the proposed approach; (4) innovative or creative approaches or solutions including the participation and/or funding by the oil and gas industry or other groups in the research industry, where appropriate; and (5) past performance. IF ANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ARE NOT MET, THE WHITE PAPER WILL NOT BE EVALUATED.  Questions shall be E-mailed to Frank.Bennett@bsee.gov not later than 2:00 p.m., Eastern Time on January 2, 2013. The Solicitation number E13PS00006 MUST be in the subject line of the E-mail.  All questions shall include the Solicitation number E13PS00006, your full name and title, your organization, complete address, and telephone and fax numbers.  Telephone inquiries WILL NOT be accepted.  A separate White Paper shall be submitted for each study on which the offeror wishes to propose.  The White Paper shall identify clearly the Offeror's company/organization, point of contact, address, telephone and facsimile numbers.  If Offerors desire to hand deliver their White Papers, they are advised that the BSEE facility is a secure office complex and Offerors MUST NOT enter the building beyond the lobby.

A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 07 - 557 - Dublin, GA is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>1.1 Description<br />a. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Special Communication Requirements (SCR) Division is surveying the commercial vendor community for all interested parties in a proposed requirement for a Level 1 Communications On-The-Move (COTM) Package in support of SCR, at St. Inigoes, MD. The purpose of this RFI is to gain insight into the Communications on the Move capabilities to provide networking, telephonic, and VTC capabilities. This RFI seeks a complete, single solution to include the transport, network, voice, VTC, and data. The Government is interested in feedback from the commercial market on the requirements listed in this RFI and commerical items that may be available to meet the requirements. Vendors are asked to respond with documentation outlining their capabilities and feedback on the requirements listed within this RFI. The Government would like to see concepts presented through drawings, slick sheets, website, or PowerPoint brief.
<p>b. On order and without notice, the HRF (Homeland Response Force) will deploy advanced BDE (Brigade) and CBRN TF (Chemical Biological Radiological, Nuclear Task Force) C2 (Command and Control) elements in advance of the main body to provide initial assessment of the situation, IC (Incident Commander) link-up, threat identification, and provide guidance back to National Guard (NG)&nbsp;reach-back organizations JTF-JFHQ/JTF-State/State JOC (Joint Task Force-Joint Force Head Quarters/Joint Task Force-State/State Joint Operations Center) for follow-on CBRN forces. Advanced Echelon Liaison (ADVON)&nbsp;teams will keep NG reach-back organizations, main elements and other incident area response entities current through continuous situational assessment updates and provide recommended NG Course of Action (COA)&nbsp;to effectively and efficiently mitigate the situation. <br /><br />c. Below is a list of requirements that are mandatory for the Level 1 COTM package.</p>
<p>1.2 General Capabilities<br />a. Level 1 satellite systems are designed to bridge the NG CBRN response element knowledge gap between the times they are initially notified and deploy, while they are en-route and after they arrive at the incident site and begin site set-up. Due to extremely aggressive response times, elements routinely deploy with little or no Intelligence / Situational Awareness&nbsp;and are expected to arrive on site, seamlessly integrate and support IC objectives and the Incident Command Plan (ICP).</p>
<p>b. Vision is to coordinate, synchronize and provide unity of effort among all National Guard Bureau (NGB) CBRN C2 deployed elements within garrison (JTF-JFHQ, JTF-State, JOC, etc) as well as deployed elements responding to the incident (HRF/CERF-P/CST/C2CRE-A) (Chemical Emergency Response Force-Package/Civil Support Team, Command and Control Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear Response Element- US Army) NG deployed CBRN units will be geographically dispersed throughout the response Area of Operations (AO). Certain elements will be operating within the Code, Warm and Hot zones. Element dispersion is situational dependant but typical distances between HRF Brigade (BGD) C2 locations and CBRN TF/CERF-Ps C2 elements are expected to be between 5-25 miles. Distances between the CBRN TF/CERF-P C2 and Search Tactical Operation Centers (TOCs) are expected to be between 1-5 miles. Distances between TOCs and deployed recovery teams near the Warm/Hot zone are expected to be up to a mile.</p>
<p>1.3 Requirements<br />a. HRF ADVON Tactical Information Exchange Requirements (IERs):</p>
<p>1. The complete HRF/CBRN TF ADVON tactical IERs are captured in the latest draft version of the National Guard HRF and CERFP Tactical Information Exchange Requirements and Baseline Communication Functional Requirements document (V1.0). The requirements document identifies the type and periodicity of C2 IERs that must flow un-obstructively between HRF ADVON, the HRF command and control (HRF C2) element and other CBRN response elements to effectively conduct and execute mission essential tasks.</p>
<p>b. Required Mobile and Stationary Communications Capabilities:</p>
<p>1. The level 1 satellite communications capability is expected to extend "no-notice" strategic IPv4 or IPv6 voice, data, and video services to support deployed HRF and CBRN TF in both the COTM as well as in a halt (stationary) configuration.</p>
<p>2. System must be capable of converting between COTM and stationary configurations with minimal effort (plug-and-play capability).</p>
<p>3. Level 1 satellite communications requirements are based on and identified within the National Guard Homeland Response Force CBRN Consequence Management Concept of Operations and validated during several NGB Capability Assessment Development Process (CADP) table-top exercises modeling a notional, regional, NGB CBRN response.</p>
<p>4. Voice Capability: The COTM solution shall provide the following minimum voice capabilities:</p>
<p>i. Redundant voice communications reach-back capability.</p>
<p>ii. Connectivity and interoperability with strategic commercial Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).</p>
<p>iii. Voice communications will provide connectivity with National Guard, Federal T-10 DoD and Civilian first responder organizations and agencies.</p>
<p>5. Data Capability: The COTM solution shall provide the following minimum data capabilities:</p>
<p>i. Access and interoperability with IPv4 or IPv6 based commercial internet.</p>
<p>ii. Provide internet connectivity with National Guard, Federal T-10 DoD and Civilian first responder organizations and agencies.</p>
<p>iii. Access to essential DoD and non-DoD portals, services and databases including mail servers, Joint Information Exchange Environment (JIEE), Defense Connect Online (DCO), and SharePoint.</p>
<p>iv. Capability to access, down-load and display DoD Geo-Special mapping and other terrain information.</p>
<p>v. Capability to modify/manipulate and locally store map images and share with other C2 elements.</p>
<p>vi. Data support for up to three (3) users simultaneously.</p>
<p>vii. Non-secure Video Teleconferencing (VTC).</p>
<p>6. The COTM solution shall meet the following operational, maintenance, and logistics requirements:</p>
<p>i. Capable of providing above mentioned voice and data capabilities while on-the-move and at-the-halt.</p>
<p>ii. Capable of sustaining operations continuously and with an availability of 99.5% during deployment and employment phases of Domestic/Homeland Response mission operations.</p>
<p>iii. Operate within both CONUS and OCONUS (Continental United States) (Outside of Continental Untied States).</p>
<p>iv. Operable, transportable, and maintainable by no more than two (2) trained personnel.</p>
<p>v. Capable of providing initial C2 voice within 15 minutes of power-up and full operational capability within 30 minutes by no more than one (1) operator.</p>
<p>vi. Operable in extreme hot and cold ambient temperatures ranging from -40&ordm; F to 120&ordm;F.</p>
<p>vii. Operable using common military or civilian portable and commercial fixed AC and DC Power sources. Solution is expected to use commercial AC while in halt mode and commercial DC (vehicle battery power) while operating in the COTM mode.</p>
<p>viii. Operable on integrated or portable power sources for no less than three (3) hours without recharging the battery.</p>
<p>ix. Able to withstand handling (e.g., vibration, shock, humidity, sand and dust) in the field during operation, maintenance, and transport.</p>
<p>x. Compliant with size and weight restrictions for carryon luggage on most major airline carriers <br /><br />xi. Be certified under the Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) interoperability certification process.</p>
<p>c. Objective Communications Requirements: The following capabilities are desired but not considered mission-critical:</p>
<p>1. Connectivity to the Defense Switched Network (DSN).</p>
<p>2. Access to Non-Secure IP Router Network (NIPRNET), and Secure IP Router Network (SIPRNET).</p>
<p>3. Concurrent non-secure, Controlled UNCLASSIFIED Information (CUI)-level secure, and SECRET-level voice communications.</p>
<p>4. Secret-level classified voice communications without disrupting non-classified communications.</p>
<p>5. Capability to support Secret-level secure VTC.</p>
<p>1.4 HRF ADVON Level 1 COTM Solution Constraints and Additional Requirements</p>
<p>a. The Level 1 COTM packages must include equipment, necessary software/accessories, reach-back access/service for one (1) year (initial), warranty support for one (1) year, and initial training.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a solicitation to General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS), 38500 Mound Road, Sterling Heights, MI for the procurement of six (6) MK 46 Gun Weapons Systems (GWS) to use as the Close in Gun Systems (CIGS) for the DDG 1000, 1001, and 1002. 

GDLS is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the sole producer of the MK 46 GWS.  The determination for a sole source is supported by a technical analysis and assessment that concluded only the GDLS MK 46 GWS can meet the DDG 1000 technical performance requirements for CIGS.  Therefore, GDLS is the only known firm possessing the requisite technical (production and engineering) expertise to produce a technically compliant GWS to meet specification in a cost-effective manner while supporting the DDG 1000 shipbuilding program schedules.

The potential contract will be awarded pursuant to 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c)(1), only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact GDLS directly.

<DESC><br />Sources Sought:<br />This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for a Market Research ONLY to determine the availability of potential small business firms for a potential small business category type set-aside. NO AWARD will be made from this Sources Sought. NO SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME; therefore, do NOT request a copy of a solicitation. Potential Offerors having the skill, capabilities and bonding necessary to perform the described project are invited to provide feedback via email to Healon.D.Knight@usace.army.mil. All responses will be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a potential future acquisition.
<p>Particularly, the purpose of this NOTICE is to gain knowledge of potential small business sources in the following categories: Certified 8a, Certified HUB Zone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), to provide the necessary traffic counters to the Government. The capabilities will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining to Set-Aside for the Small Business Community or to conduct as an Unrestricted Procurement. Other than small businesses may respond to this NOTICE in the event the market does not indicate SB interest, however, preference will be given to the SB categories listed above. The government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of available Kntrs.</p>
<p>NAICS Code:<br />The proposed NAICS code for this potential procurement is 334519 - Other Measuring &amp; Controlling Device Manufacturing/500 Employees.</p>
<p>Contract Activities:<br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District Civil Works Water Resource Development Projects has an upcoming project entitled, "Traffic Counters for Various USACE-SPK Parks and Lakes, California." The primary objective of this SOURCES SOUGHT notice is to identify businesses capable of providing the necessary supplies to the Government.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation. This is a merely a request for information. Do not call the Contract Specialist or the Contracting Officer, a solicitation is not being issued at this time.</p>
<p>Salient Characteristics:<br />The Government requires traffic counting devices which will be placed the roadway(s). The geographic location is the remote foothills of the Western slope of the Sierra Nevada's in California. Weather conditions vary from 20 degree F to 110 degree F. If counters are installed above ground, they will be exposed to all weather conditions and temperature ranges. If counters are installed below ground, they will be placed in rocky, to semi-rocky, to clay-like soils. If installed below ground, traffic counters will still be exposed to any naturally occurring precipitation events. The integrity of the equipment proposed will be maintained at least to these environmental conditions and may be designed for more extreme environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Traffic counting devices must have flexible mounting options. The equipment may be installed above ground or below ground. It shall be capable of being fastened to metal, wooden or hybrid plastic poles. The vendor should expect that their proposed equipment, if installed above ground, will be placed in some type of weather proof housing, examples of a weatherproof housing may include: Pelican case, Otter box, or generic fiberglass housing. Therefore, the counters must be stand-alone and self-contained. The counters must not have any external wires or tubes. The vendor must demonstrate the ability of the equipment to operate from within these types of enclosures.</p>
<p>The traffic counters are expected to count single lanes, dual lanes, or may need to count single lanes for a portion of any given year and dual lanes for another portion of any given year. Lanes of traffic may be on concrete, asphalt, decomposed granite or native soil roadways. Lanes of traffic may be level, or up to 7% grade. The vendor will demonstrate the ability of the proposed equipment to accurately count vehicles in at least these conditions.</p>
<p>The vendor's equipment will have a numeric readout with at least a 6-digit LCD tally display. This display must be easily calibrated and reset by the end user as necessary. The display will be an inherent component of the meter and must be incorporated into the stand alone design. The display must be easily read in inclement weather and lighting. The readout must be easily read without having to open the weatherproof housing.</p>
<p>The vendor should assume that the counters will be installed in locations where no permanent source of electrical energy is available. The preferred device will operate in an efficient manner so as to prolong the life of the power source inherent to the device. The efficiency of the device will be maximized so as to reduce to the greatest extent possible the frequency of battery replacement. The power source will be a common type of battery. The battery or batteries supplied will be small in physical size with consideration to the overall size and weight of the entire unit. Therefore, preferred designs will use alkaline C-cell battery power.</p>
<p>Meters must be no greater than 11cm wide by 15 cm long by 3 cm high, inclusive of the numeric read out LCD display. Meters will be installed in vandalism prone areas and vendors will consider the impact vandalism and visitor abuse may have to the equipment. The preferred product should lend itself to an inconspicuous installation.</p>
<p>Maintenance requirements will be kept to a minimum. The number of moving and/or serviceable parts should be kept to a minimum. The preferred product will have a "set-it" and "forget-it" build. There will be no special tools required for installation or maintenance.</p>
<p>The counters will arrive ready for installation and will be preprogrammed from the vendor to count automotive vehicles.</p>
<p>The data collected by the counters will be transferable to a computer. Either a docking device and/or cable will be included and may be either part of the device or may be a separate component. The end result being that the Government shall be able to download or access the data collected by the device via computer for future use in studies or metric analysis.</p>
<p>Capabilities Statement:<br />The following requests are designed to apprise the US Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District, of any prospective Kntrs who have the capabilities associated with this work requirement. Please provide your response to the following. The submission is limited to 20 pages, cut-sheets are allowable.</p>
<p>1) Offerors name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address.</p>
<p>2) Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the Capabilities statement.</p>
<p>3) Offerors type of small business and Business Size (HubZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned and/or Small Business, 8(a))</p>
<p>4) Offerors Joint Venture information if applicable existing and potential</p>
<p>The Capabilities Statement for this sources sought is not expected to be a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach, but rather short statements regarding the company's ability to demonstrate existing-or-developed expertise and experience in relation to the areas specified herein. Any commercial brochures or currently existing marketing material may also be submitted with the Capabilities statement. Submission of Capabilities statement is not a prerequisite to any potential future offerings, but participation will assist the Corps of Engineers in tailoring requirements to be consistent with industry capabilities. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is neither to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. After completing its analysis, the Government will determine whether to limit competition among 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran, HubZone, or all Small Business firms or proceed with full and open competition as Unrestricted.

<p>1.1 SCOPE<br />In order to ensure safe, economical and effective operational employment of these aircraft, and in keeping with the excellent stewardship of American tax-payer resources, the U. S. Coast Guard needs personnel properly trained in maintaining newly installed Avionics 1 Upgrade (A1U) aircraft equipment. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) seeks a contractor to develop a detailed hands on A1U maintenance troubleshooting training curriculum complete with troubleshooting instruction down to the A1U Line Replaceable Units (LRU)s for the USCG's Fleet of HC-130H aircraft. This effort requires the Contractor to develop a maintainer course for training USCG Fleet maintenance personnel for all newly installed A1U systems equipment to include training and use of maintenance procedure cards (MPCs). The maintainer course shall be developed in accordance with the guidelines specified in the USCG Training System SOPs.</p>
<p>The contractor's course shall include but shall not be limited to, overviews of installed A1U equipment; troubleshooting instruction of all A1U systems equipment to the LRU level; fault Isolation procedures; safety requirements, scheduled maintenance training; and operational performance checks for A1U systems equipment. The primary USCG personnel rate to be trained with this course will be Aviation Electronics Technicians (AETs). All training materials and training aids developed for this task shall be considered property of the USCG and shall be delivered in its entirety as a requirement of completion of this task.

<AWARDEE>CARAHSOFT TECHNOLOGY 12369 SUNRISE VALLEY DRIVE RESTON, VA 20191-5471
<DESC>NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION NASA SHARED SERVICES CENTER LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION I recommend that NASA, NASA Shared Services Center (NSSC) negotiate with SAP Public Services, Inc. (SAP), only for the continued maintenance of the Agencys SAP software licenses.  This action will be performed against GSA Contract GS-35F-0406V.  The total estimated cost of this effort is $XXXXX and the period of performance which includes a base period of 12 months (January 01, 2013 through December 31, 2013); option period one (January 01, 2014 through December 31, 2013); option period two (January 01, 2015 through December 31, 2015). This procurement is for the renewal of annual software maintenance services for the Agencys SAP software license which currently supports a user base of 10,000 professional users and 291 developer users.	The maintenance will consist of the following: 	The delivery of Releases, Versions, Correction Levels and Software correction packages, support via telephone, remote support/update, and SAP's On-line Software Services. 	Access to SAPs On-line Software Service (OSS) database. 	SAP NetWeaver BI Accelerator software and maintenance. 	SAP Productivity Pak software and maintenance. This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), which implements the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Program cited in FAR 8.401 pursuant to Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251) and Title 40 U.S.C 501, Services for Executive Agencies, for the acquisition of supplies or services when only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:  1.	Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique specialized nature of the work.  NASA's financial system was designed using SAP software.  NASA competitively selected SAP in September, 2000, to be the primary commercial-off-the shelf (COTS) software vendor for the Integrated Enterprise Management Program (IEMP), NASA's primary financial system.  Without SAP's software maintenance, NASA's financial system will be put at an unacceptable risk to NASA's day-to-day operations. 2.	No other supplies or services will satisfy the agencys requirement and no other provider can supply a similar service. 3.	No other vendor has access to detailed and timely knowledge of SAPs existing and emerging product set, especially with regard to ongoing development and product planning which directly benefits NASAs ongoing activities to improve financial management throughout the Agency 4.	 SAP is solely positioned to support NASAs implementation of its new product capabilities/enhancements due to their detailed knowledge of NASAs existing configuration. This knowledge has been obtained via the existing contract vehicle which has been in existence since 2000. 5.	Redesigning NASA's financial systems to use different accounting software is cost prohibitive. Pursuant to FAR 8.404, BPAs and orders placed against a MAS, using the procedures in this subpart, are considered to be issued using full and open competition (see 6.102(d)(3)). Therefore, when establishing a BPA (as authorized by 13.303-2(c)(3)), or placing orders under Federal Supply Schedule contracts using the procedures of 8.405, ordering activities shall not seek competition outside of the Federal Supply Schedules or synopsize the requirement. However, the Limited Source Justification will be synopsized within 14 days after award pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(a)(2) Pursuant to FAR 8.404 (d) services offered on the schedule are priced either at hourly rates, or at a fixed price for performance of a specific task (e.g., maintenance). "GSA has already determined the prices of supplies and fixed-price services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable. Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing, except for a price evaluation as required by 8.405-2(d)." Notwithstanding, the NSSC will seek additional pricing discounts pursuant to FAR 8.405-4 before placing the order. Due to the specialized nature of this requirement, there are no known actions which the agency may take to remove or overcome barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the services required.	Market research indicates that there will be adequate competition. SAP and several VARs have the ability to provide quotes for continued SAP maintenance.

<DESC>Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition<br />Department of Labor/Office of Procurement Services
<p>1. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>The U.S, Department of Labor Office of Procurement Services will award a subscription to StateNet, a product of Information for Public Affairs, Inc. supporting the Employment and Training Administration, Office of Unemployment Insurance (UI).</p>
<p>2. A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value including all options).</p>
<p>Statenet is an online database that tracks and reports all state and federal Unemployment Insurance legislation from introduction to enactment on a daily basis. Statenet also provides online customized UI regulatory screening, status, and summaries, as well as the yearly state legislative sessions. Statenet is used by the Division of Legislation to efficiently monitor UI state and federal legislative activity, to review proposed and enacted laws for conformity and compliance and to access the National State Net Capitol Journal. The government cost estimate is $.</p>
<p>3. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>48 CFR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>4. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.</p>
<p>StateNet provides state legislative information - bill text and status in the legislative process-and customized reports based on client needs. These customized reports are created via StateNet's unique search engines and the expertise of issue analysts. Products of other companies aren't comparable because they do not have issue analysts and because their information is not available as quickly as StateNet's information. (Since other companies buy some of the information that StateNet gathers, StateNet customers can access this information at least a day earlier than customers of other companies.) In order for the Division of Legislation to do its job, it is essential to get updated, accurate state legislation information as quickly as possible. Only StateNet can meet these needs. For these reasons, we have been contracting with StateNet for many years. StateNet has provided us with an excellent service that meets all of our needs.</p>
<p>5. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.</p>
<p>The Office of Unemployment Insurance needs a subscription to StateNet because it provides a service necessary to efficiently monitor UI state and federal legislative activity, to review proposed and enacted laws for conformity and compliance and to access the National State Net Capitol Journal. Although we have researched other companies' offerings, no one offers what StateNet does.</p>
<p>6. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>The service is valued at $ per year and DOL anticipates an award price of $, a discount of $ for renewal of the subscription.</p>
<p>7. A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>The Office of Unemployment Insurance surveyed the internet to determine that no other service provides comparable information and services. StateNet provides state legislative information - bill text and status in the legislative process-and customized reports based on client needs. These customized reports are created via StateNet's unique search engines and the expertise of issue analysts. Products of other companies are not comparable because they do not have issue analysts and because their information is not available as quickly as StateNet's information. (Since other companies buy some of the information that StateNet gathers, StateNet customers can access this information at least a day earlier than customers of other companies.)</p>
<p>8. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as:</p>
<p>(i)Explanation of why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available. <br />(ii) When 6.302-1 is cited for follow-on acquisitions as described in 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), an estimate of the cost to the Government that would be duplicated and how the estimate was derived.</p>
<p>This is a commercial service so technical specifications are proprietary and not available for publication.</p>
<p>9. A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed in writing, an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>None</p>
<p>10. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.</p>
<p>This justification supports a one year subscription. Before renewing the subscription for another year, the Office of Unemployment Insurance will survey the market to determine if competing services have become available. If one or more competing services become available the requirement will be competed.</p>

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS
Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 4,  Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  

This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of Home Oxygen Services from the incumbent to cover the time January 1, 2013 through May 31, 2013.  Columbia Ancillary Services, Inc. is the incumbent of an expired contract.   This requirement is procured under NIACS 532291 with a new size standard of $30,000,000. The procurement process was previously interrupted by a protest ruling.  The Government initiated a new procurement process and it has been interrupted by three additional protests. A ruling on the most recent protest by the Court of Federal Claims has not been rendered to date and there is no projected date.  This interim contract will provide Home Oxygen Services during the gap between the expired contract and the new contract to be awarded after protest ruling.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  

The contractor will provide Home Oxygen Services and related supplies for Veterans and Beneficiaries of the Louis A. Johnson Healthcare System. The VAMC currently serves an estimated 1500 patients covering parts of northern West Virginia, southeast Ohio and southwest Pennsylvania. Required services include storage, delivery, set-up, adjustment, patient/caregiver instructions and recovery of equipment.  Contractors shall have applicable expertise in government acquisition and program management disciplines.  This contract covers January 1, 2013 through May 31, 2013.  The length of service is the estimated procurement lead time that would be required to finalize the acquisition process once a protest decision is rendered.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(c), as implemented by FAR 6.302.  

	(X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(X)  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability

5.	Validity of Use (applicability of authority):   

Only one responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy the Agency Requirement: The incumbent is currently performing this complex requirement at a satisfactory level.   A change in vendor would require finding a vendor that is capable of servicing approximately 1500 veterans across a diverse geographical area. None of our known interested vendors currently service this area. The Vendor would need to be established locally before the start of the period of performance as to meet the response time indicated in the statement of work.  A vendor must also have ample rental equipment and supplies available to provide the required services and supplies to patients. Based on past experience and input from colleagues throughout the VISN, the Chief of Prosthetics estimates it would take approximately 45-60 days after the period of performance begins to fully and safely switch contractors.  For this requirement, a disruption in services is not an acceptable solution.  

Unusual and Compelling Urgency: We have received a total of five protest regarding this requirement.  Two against the previous solicitation, in which a ruling caused the Government to cancel that solicitation and reissue, and three against this solicitation. We are awaiting a ruling on the most recent protest to the Court of Federal Claims.  This solicitation is extended indefinitely.  It is imperative that our patients have home oxygen services that are uninterrupted.  Our contract has expired which has made it necessary to put in place an interim contract.   A protest decision is imminent and could be rendered any day.  In September, the Contracting Officer through the DOJ Attorney recently petitioned the court and explained the need for a timely decision.  We had anticipated a decision would be rendered before the last interim contract expired but it was not.  We are unable to plan and advertise a long term contract because the Government is staying while we await a decision.  This has put the Government in a situation where we must have services for the veteran, but are unable to competitively award such service creating an environment where there is only one responsible source and an urgent and compelling need.

This option represents the best value for the government and provides for continuity of care for our veterans.   The incumbent is honoring prices from the last contract to bridge the gap between the expired contract and the new award. There will be no cumbersome process for exit and entrance between vendors.  The incumbent is already set up to provide this service in the geographical area and they are proven capable and responsible.  Their staff is familiar with our patients and our processes.  For a five month contract sole sourcing our requirement to the incumbent is the only viable option available to the Government.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  

Changing vendors for a 5-month period while the contract requirement is being solicited is not an option based on the complexity of this requirement. There is approximately 1500 veterans serviced by this contract.  The vast geographical areas serviced by this contract make it difficult and expensive to have the equipment switched out.   The contractor is responsible for providing all the equipment and supplies that are necessary to service this contract.  The award of a contract for a base plus four option years is anticipated within 90 days after the protest is ruled on and the solicitation can be closed.

The Contracting Officer made an effort to petition the court to deliver a timely decision in September 2012. The Contracting Officer has made multiple attempts to award a competitive contract, but due to multiple protests and a delay in the court ruling in the most recent protest, the Contracting Officer has been unsuccessful in awarding a competitive acquisition.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

The anticipated price to the Government is $ 497,740.  This option represents the best value for the government.   The incumbent is honoring prices from the last contract to bridge the gap between the expired contract and the new award. This price has already been proven fair and reasonable five years ago when the last contract was awarded and again each time an interim contract was put in place.  Based on proposals received on the first solicitation (that was rescinded due to a sustained protest, the price is fair and reasonable) the price is considered fair and reasonable.  Based on comparisons to prices of other VA contracts, the prices is fair and reasonable (FAR 15.404-1). The incumbent is already set up to provide this service and they are proven capable and responsible.    

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
The Government is awarding this contract to the incumbent to bridge the gap between the expired contract and the award of the contract currently under solicitation. Market research was completed for the solicitation currently under protest.  Based on that market research the long term procurement was designated as 100% HubZone set-aside. Market Research was conducted by advertising a sources sought notice through FedBizOpps under NAICS Code 532291.  One SDVOSB/HubZone, two Small Businesses/HubZone and one Large Businesses responded who were considered capable.    

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: No one has expressed in writing that they are interested in performing this interim contract or any of the others.  For the long term contract, One SDVOSB/HubZone, two Small Businesses/HubZone and one Large Businesses responded to the sources sought.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  Procurement will be competitively acquired as a 100% HubZone set-aside once there is a protest ruling.  The interim contract is sole sourced to a small business.
