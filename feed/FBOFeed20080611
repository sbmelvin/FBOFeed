<DESC><p>Air Force Research Laboratory, Air Vehicles Directorate, Control Sciences Division, Control Systems Development &amp; Applications Branch, (AFRL/RBCC) solicits research proposals to further develop an automated aerial refueling (AAR) capability within the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) as a risk reduction measure to enable future unmanned air vehicle (UAV) weapon system development programs. This program will build upon previous AAR Phase I technical efforts that developed and demonstrated a proof-of-concept AAR capability employing a single-channel relative navigation (RELNAV) system based on Precision GPS (PGPS). The AAR Phase I system was developed, integrated into tanker and (piloted) surrogate UAV receiver aircraft, and demonstrated by simulation and by flight test to the pre-contact, contact and observation aerial refueling positions. During formal simulation activities conducted at AFRL Aerospace Vehicles Technology Assessment and Simulation (AVTAS) facility, entire refueling operations beginning with rendezvous through post refueling were demonstrated. During flight test, automated maneuvering between positions and key portions of rendezvous were also demonstrated.
<p>Future unmanned aircraft may utilize both boom and receptacle (USAF-style) and probe and drogue (United States Navy(USN) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)-style) refueling. This BAA seeks to develop and demonstrate AAR capabilities for aerial refueling using the boom and receptacle method, while ensuring as much commonality between the USN and USAF AAR architectures as possible. Unique USN AAR configurations, however, will not be demonstrated under this BAA.</p>

<DESC>Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) is a net-centric Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) weapon system (WS), capable of tasking ISR sensors and receiving, processing, exploiting, and disseminating data/information from airborne, national, and commercial reconnaissance platforms and sensors such as the U-2, Global Hawk, and Predator. AF DCGS performs global multi-INT operations and correlates collected Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT). This WS consists of numerous active duty, Air National Guard, and mission-partner sites interconnected by the Global Information Grid (GIG).
AF DCGS Block 20 (Formerly known as Increment 2) is the next major acquisition activity building upon the architectural framework established by AF DCGS Block 10.2. Block 20 will modernize Signals Intelligence capabilities, integrating it into AF DCGS net-centric environment as well as provide new and enhanced capabilities and continuing IMINT and MASINT updates. AF DCGS WS capabilities will be expanded to handle an increased number of existing, upgraded, and new sensors with improved communications and processing/exploitation timelines. Current planning is for these capabilities to be developed and fielded through several versions, with each version providing a capability that is affordable, militarily useful, and based on a mature technology. 
The Integrator's role will be to implement an existing SOA infrastructure, and manage/complete all mission capability integration efforts, including testing, by strictly conforming to the architecture/standards which will be developed and provided by the Government.  The Integrator will also be required to develop and implement a System Integration Lab (SIL) where a prototype and future capability releases will be fully tested prior to fielding.  Associate contractor agreements (ACA), as well as Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) plans will be mandatory for all contracts.

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for one or more contractors to help resolve adverse effects of full-field oil and gas development in southeastern New Mexico.  It is anticipated that one or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Type contracts will be awarded as a result of this solicitation.  Task orders will then be competed among the awarded contracts.  The period of performance will be one year, with 4 additional one year option periods. The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed: This is designed to implement the Permian Basin Mitigation Program.  This program is designed to treat the long-term cumulative and indirect effect of full oil field development upon historic properties within a 28 quad region in southeast New Mexico.    
This mitigation program will emphasize the excavation and testing of those historic properties most likely to answer high priority research questions posed in a 2006 regional research design (RRD).  However, this also includes a variety of treatment measures that will be employed as well.  
This mitigation program is designed to better understand the correlation between surface site manifestations and subsurface components as well as the data potential of surface and near-surface site assemblages.  The knowledge gained will enable the BLM to make more informed determinations of site eligibility for nomination to the National Register.  The mitigation will enable the agency to better manage cultural resources, focus on the most important prehistoric and proto-historic properties in the region, offer communities interpretive programs based on what is learned from the studies, and improved Section 106 procedures for this region.
The RRD governing this Permian Basin Mitigation Program is the 2006 "Southeastern New Mexico Regional Research Design and Resource Management Plan" by Patrick Hogan of the Office of Contract Archeology, University of New Mexico.  That document will govern initial site types, problem domains, fieldwork, and analytic standards that must be adhered to in tasks awarded under this contract.   The refinement of site types, fieldwork, and laboratory procedures proposed in the RRD as well as answering and/or refining the research questions posed within it are expected outcomes of this program. 
The purpose of this program is to implement a creative, directed program to resolve adverse effects and, in particular, the cumulative and indirect effects of full-field oil and gas development in southeastern New Mexico.  It will result in better decisions affecting the management of historic properties in the Permian Basin.  High rates of erosion within the sand sheets of the region are compounding human-caused losses of artifacts, site features, and depositional integrity.  The program seeks to acquire better knowledge about the prehistory of southeast New Mexico through the systematic application of a standard research design and a uniform field methodology.   Information gained will improve the process for making determinations of eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places.  Periodic public conferences and popular and technical synthesis will ensure that the public appreciates what the study of cultural resources can say regarding cultural developments in this frontier region. 
This is not intended to be a complete list of the specifications. The full requirement will be posted in solicitation NAR080078, which will be available at http://www.fbo.gov on or about June 25, 2008.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Facsimile proposals will not be accepted. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<DESC><p>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, ALOSH, Morgantown, WV, intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Quantachrome Corporation, 1900 Corporate Drive, Boynton Beach, FL 33426-6650. The purpose of this contract is to purchase a Quadrasorb SI Kryton - Bench Top Surface Area and Pore Size/Volume Anayzer offered by Quantachrome and it is the only brand and model of instrument compatible with the existing instrumentation in the laboratory and the instrument has the required sensitivity and accuracy. The quantasorb uses a software acquisition program that is compatible with the existing Quantachrome software on the nitrogen absorption system. The NIOSH laboratory has invested several thousand of dollars from several research projects to purchase nearly 100 sample cells, filler rods, and other supplies that are inter-changeable between the existing nitrogen system and the quantasorb SI krypton system. By owning two compatible systems, we will eliminate redundancy in supply purhcases, reduce laboratory storage space requirements, and eliminate potential for diminished data quality by errant use of similar looking but incompatible sample supplies between instruments. Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages. Please forward capabilities and supporting information to: Kimberly Groves, Reference: 000HCCHC-2008-56928, DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, or E-mail kpg0@cdc.gov or fax to 304-285-6083.
<p>The government will review any/all capabilities statements and and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract. Vendors may register at www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with Quantachrome Instruments as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>
<p>Original Point of Contact: Kimberly Groves, Purchasing Agent, Phone 304-285-5885, Fax 304-285-6083, Email kpg0@cdc.gov.</p>

<DESC>***********PLEASE CONTACT MARY BRINKLEY ONLY FOR TECHNICAL OR QUOTE ISSUES.  MARYBRINKLEY'S CONTACT INFORMATION IS IN THE BODY OF THIS SOLICITATION***********NASA/MSFC has a requirement to purchase a Cumulative Helium Leak Detector 700H CHLD.  The basic system consists of a mass analyzer, modified cryo pump, turbopump/mechanicalpump, gauging and inlet chamber.  The mass analyzer and valving are computer controlled. The operation of the pump is automated. Taking advantage of our high sensitivity, theHowl-Mann equation indicates bombing times under an hour for 0.1 cc packages tested to anAir equivalent leak rate of 1.0E-9 atm-cc/sec.	For UB and smaller packages, the bombingstep is just minutes. If you are sealing  Helium in the package the bombing step is notrequired.  The inlet chamber is pumped down with a modified cryo pump which does not pumpHelium.  The resulting gas is analyzed with the mass analyzer, and in this mode ofoperation leaks from 1.0scc/sec to less than 4.0E-14scc/sec can be measured.  The secondmode of operation routes the gas through the analyzer chamber first and enables theanalyzer to test for any gas (i.e., Freon if parts have been gross leak tested using theFreon/bubble techniques.)  This second mode is also helpful if parts have been filledwith Krypton, Zenon or other gas mixtures.  Calibration for Helium leaks is very simple. A standard leak is connected to the inlet and the slope of the Helium curves is measured. The measured slope is linearly proportional to the measured leak.  The computer softwarecorrects for the temperature coefficient of the standard leak when computing the result.1.  Standard System, Model 700H CHLD	a.  Mass Range 1-100AMU	b.  Helium Leak Range 1.0scc/sec to 4.0E-14scc/sec	c.  Throughput capability  4500 pieces in a 20 hour period including recordingserial numbers and unwrapping ESD packing.  If no serial number record is required andthere is no packaging to unwrap throughput increases to 12000 parts in a 20 hour period. The system will includes the following:ITEM	QTY	DESCRIPTION				1.	1 ea.	Model 700H CHLD 			3.	1 ea.	Standard Small Test Chamber			4.	1 ea.	12 Month Warranty				5.	3 days	Training					6.	1 ea.

Spare Parts Kit(optional)NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Pernicka Corporation on a sole source basis. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: Pernicka offers the only CHLD system that meets the technical requirements forhermeticilty testing. Pernicka Corporation was identified as the only company who canprovide an instrument that utilizes a nondestructive test method to perform both fine andgross leak tests on sealed packages and components.	 Currently this is the onlyinstrument on the market capable of reporting data within the range of the newspecification limits mandated by the Defense Supply Center Columbus (DSCC) as defined inthe revised version of MIL-STD-750.

<DESC>Using negotiated procedures authorized in Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15, the Department of Justice contemplates award of up to four (4) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts with private practitioners of law for debt collection services on behalf of the United States in the counties that comprise the Federal Judicial District for the District of South Carolina. Pursuant to the Federal Debt Recovery Act, this procurement is strictly limited to law firms or solo practitioners of law. Additionally, eligibility for award is restricted to only those law firms or solo practitioners licensed to practice law in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina and who are regularly engaged in the private practice of law in that district. "Regularly engaged" in this context is construed to mean that at least 20% of the debt collection cases handled by the firm/practitioner arise in the district. Contractors will be required to pursue debt collection activities which parallel existing industry procedures that have proven to be effective and efficient; to interact with government representatives at defined stages of the collection process (i.e., settlement, compromise, etc.); and to input relevant case data in a computer database maintained by the Government. Contract payments will be based on contingency fees for unsecured debt collection and/or firm-fixed prices for secured debt collection. The anticipated period of performance for each contract will be one (1) base year and up to six (6) option years.  The anticipated release date for the solicitation, which will be available only on the Federal Business Opportunities website, www.fbo.gov, is on or about June 26, 2008. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be available. Amendments to the solicitation issued prior to the receipt of proposals will also be posted on www.fbo.gov. Interested parties are responsible to monitor this site for access to the solicitation. All responsible sources meeting the eligibility requirements may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government. It is highly recommended that, prior to submitting a proposal, all interested parties obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number, register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and complete online representations and certifications in ORCA, the Online Representations and Certifications Application, as these requirements are mandatory for any firm selected for a contract award.  Easy access to all three systems is found on the CCR homepage, www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>It is the intention of Military Sealift Command to enter into a sole source negotiation with Oldenburg Group Inc. (OGI) through subsidiary Lake Shore located in Kingsford, WI for the overhaul and modernization of two 5 ton Sail Cranes on the AS-39 Subtender.  The performance period is anticipated to be 8 months and the place of performance will be at the Contractors facility and at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.  OGI has been approved for this procurement as a HUBZone Small Business sole source because OGI is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and provides all replacement parts to the US Navy for the 5 Ton Sail Cranes on the AS-39.  Construction drawings and other original technical documentation containing detail design and logistics information to the level of detail needed for this requirement are exclusively held by OGI.  Information, e.g. backlash tolerances, gear pitch dimensions, and other vital data that is required in order to properly conduct condition surveys and provide the necessary crane repair or replacement is contained in OGIs technical documentation.  OGI is the only source with the specialized knowledge and capability to accomplish this requirement.  Drawings and technical information in possession of the Navy contain general arrangement and disassembly drawings that do not contain the level of detail required for the condition surveys/determinations or required remedies for deficient components in accordance with the Statement of Work.

<DESC><p>The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to negotiate with the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), Hiroshima, Japan for a five year support services contract entitled, "Support For Epidemiological Studies of Cancer Among Atomic Bomb Survivors".   This is a renewal of Contract No. N01-CP-31012 with the National Academy of Sciences, who has been subcontracting out the majority of the work for this on-going project to the RERF since 1979.  This is a transition to a new phse of of this on-going project.&nbsp; The RERF owns and has been maintaining the Life Span Study (LSS) a continuing long-term cohort study of 94,000 atomic bomb survivors and 26,000 non-exposed residents in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  This cohort is among the largest populations exposed to external low linear energy transfer radiation.  The cohort follow-up based on nationwide mortality tracing (since 1950) and active cancer incidence surveillance (since 1958) consists of both males and females of all ages, including a large number of persons exposed at infancy and during childhood.  In addition, a unique cohort of 3,600 subjects who were exposed to radiation in utero is the only human population in which long-term cancer risk data are being accumulated.  Well-characterized individual radiation dose estimates, most recently updated in 2002, are available for 95% of the cohort.  The most important finding from the long-term follow-up of the LSS cohort is the persistently increased risk of solid cancer attributable to radiation, which is demonstrable 60 years after the atomic bombs and which may last for life (Preston, Shimizu et al. 2003; Preston, Ron et al. 2007).  Up to the present time, over 17,500 incident cases have occurred in this cohort, and 850 of these were estimated to be excess cases due to radiation exposure - a far greater number observed than in the other large cohorts.  This renewal will be negotiated directly with RERF as a support services contract with the emphasis on supporting various epidemiological and multi-disciplinary studies of cancer that will be characterizing organ- and tissue specific cancer risks, modifying and interactive effects on the radiation-related cancer risk, and undertaking molecular genetic studies in the LSS.  Authority:  41 USC 253 (c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The proposed contract is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis with be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.</p>

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

The Molecular Pathology Unit (MPU) is a CCR resource unit that has 2 key interrelated roles.  The MPU develops, correlates and interprets novel protocols in molecular diagnostics and plays a role in developing applications in noninvasive medical imaging for animal models.  The Unit also operates a PhD-granting research training program in comparative molecular pathology through a university- NCI graduate partnership program.  Through its training program, the MPU both extends comparative pathology expertise provided by veterinarians to the CCR, and it conducts research, which serves as a source of research training experience for its GPP molecular pathologist trainees.  The programs vision includes pathologist as investigator and collaborator, vertically-integrated from basic discovery to translational research application.  This disciplinary perspective and approach leverages pathology expertise within CCR.
NCIs Goal is to provide a digitally scanned archive which will contain digital images of all the specimens and include all data generated through use of its materials. To move ahead with this project it is necessary to purchase a proven digital slide scanner with database capable of searching images and data and one that has password security already in place. Furthermore, a high quality, proven digital slide scanner will provide essential links within the CCR, and with the Pathology Histology Laboratory (PHL), and our GPP University partners for interaction with organ systems and comparative pathology experts. 

Part II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition: 

Statutory Authority 

Statute: This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(2) and 13.501(a)(1).

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(2) For sole source acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply. 

 No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy   agency need.  

Justification:  

The cited authority is being used to propose that Aperio Technologies, Inc. supply the required instrument.  Specifications itemized below to fulfill the governments requirements were determined in order to provide for an instrument capable of creating virtual microscopic image files for use and analysis within the existing research environment.  Instrumentation is required that will be fully functional with pre-existing instruments located in other laboratories within the institution.  The instrument must use similar technology and produce images to include image file management parameters that are equal to and fully compatible with existing instruments.  The government has determined that, for the specific research applications in place, files created with image tiling technology are not suitable for use and analysis in its research.  

The Aperio digital slide scanner is already being used successfully in other NCI laboratories and has been proven to produce high resolution images.  The database hierarchy structure provides the utility to investigators, collaborators within and outside the NIH.   The database provides secure password protected access to be granted to specific folders, or data groups.  It is fully searchable, incorporates barcoding necessary for high volume studies, and complimentary documents (reports, MRI scans, photos, etc.) can be scanned directly into and added to the database.  This system provides for multi-user, multi-site digital slide conferencing enhancing the ability of true collaborative efforts. This system uniquely provides automated image analysis using positive pixel count and color deconvolution, and also creates images that can be exported for use with third party image analysis software.

<DESC><p>The United States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Radiation Solutions, Inc. (RSI) of Mississauga Ontario, Canada to provide a airborne Digital Gamma-Ray Spectrometer RSX-5(U) with refurbishment of Nal Crystal Detectors. This action will replace an older system designed twenty years ago which now has antiquated analog design, manual tuning, tedious daily set-up, high maintenance, and a lack of reliable and inefficient snow survey programs. RSI proposed system is compact relative to the existing system. The Nal crystal detectors downward and upward capability when airborne is greatly enhanced with this proposed system. In addition, the proposed RS-500 series unit utilizes advanced technology and software techniques that will provide laboratory levels of spectra performance that were previously unachievable. RSI is the only manufactures that offer an airborne unit to the Government's specifications and they are an industry leader in the gamma ray detection systems. RSI's unit meets all the requirements and needs of NOAA to upgrade their current antiquated system. Selecting an alternative model would result in significant additional costs for upgrades and additional design costs. In addition, this unit must be in place in prior to the start of the winter season. Vendors who believe that can satisfy the Government's requirement are invited to submit an affirmative response. To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to meet the existing training, and logistical requirements aforementioned. All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis. This is in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirement. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. A firm fixed-price purchase order is contemplated for this effort. Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 30 June 2008. Please submit any and all written responses to Mark Miller via e-mail at Mark.A.Miller@ noaa.gov.</p>

<ARCHDATE>08012008
<CONTACT>Julie L Paul, Phone (301) 757-6570, Fax (301) 757-9039, Email julie.paul@navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD intends to conduct a full and open competition for the development, manufacture, integration, and test, delivery, and support of a CH-46E helicopter Torque Signal Conditioning and Indicator System (TSCIS) and an engine power turbine inlet temperature (T5) indicator gauge.  The entire effort will be awarded to one contractor and will be known as the CH-46E engine performance gauge upgrade.  Proposals are not requested at this time and will not be accepted until after a solicitation is released on or around 31 July 2008.  

The TSCIS provides engine performance information to the pilot and co-pilot, two (2) identical gauges per aircraft.  The new TSCIS shall incorporate the functionality of the signal conditioners and torquemeter indicators into one indicator that fits into the existing torquemeter indicator position in the existing CH-46E instrument panel   No new support equipment shall be required.  The Functional Requirements Document for the H-46 TSCIS will be used for technical and environmental requirements for this procurement.  The key performance parameters for the new TSCIS are:  (1) Shall be compatible and capable of being integrated with existing H-46E torque measuring system; (2) Shall meet or exceed the accuracy of the H-46E Aircraft integrated Maintenance System (AIMS); (3) Shall meet the fit and functionality of the existing torquemeter indicator; (4) Shall provide torque signal validity; (5) Shall require no peculiar support equipment; (6) Shall have minimal operational and maintenance impact; (7) Shall combine the functionality of the current H-46E signal conditioner and torquemeter indicator into one indicator that utilizes the existing location on both the pilot and co-pilot consoles; (8) Shall be Night Vision Goggle (NVG) compatible; and (9) Shall be at least as reliable as the current torque signal conditioner and torque gauge.  Due to the expected retirement of the CH-46E in the near future, it is desired that the TSCIS be currently in use or be capable of being used on other USMC helicopters such as the H-1 series, CH-53D/E  or MV-22 or on other military aircraft operated currently by the Department of Defense.

The Engine power turbine inlet temperature (T5) gauge provides engine performance information to the pilot and copilot, two (2) identical gauges per aircraft.  The upgraded T5 gauge will have all the same functionality as the current gauge and will fit into the same size hole and location in the current instrument panel as the current T5 gauge. The CH-46E T5 gauge specification will be used to address all detailed technical or environmental issues. The key performance parameters for the new T5 gauge are:  (1) Shall have a mechanical needle much like the current gauge; (2) Shall have a digital NVG compatible display indicating the temperature in degrees Celsius in one (1) degree increments; (2) Shall be as accurate as the current AIMS system, which is plus or minus one (1) degree across the entire range; (3) Shall be NVG compatible;  (4) Shall be able to alert the pilot that he is approaching any of the T5 limits published in the current CH-46 operators manual; (5) Shall require no new support equipment; (6) Shall have minimal operational and maintenance impact; and (7) Shall be at least as reliable as the current gauge.  Due to the expected retirement of the CH-46E in the near future it is desired that the upgraded T5 gauge be currently in use or be capable of being used on other USMC helicopters such as the H-1 series, CH-53D/E  or MV-22 or on other military aircraft operated currently by the Department of Defense.

The CH-46E program is looking to expedite the fielding of these new engine performance instruments.  The Preliminary Design Review (PDR) will be conducted within four (4) months after contract award and the Critical Design Review (CDR) will be conducted within seven (7) months after contract award.  Installation on the CH-46E aircraft must begin in October 2009.  The estimated quantity for this procurement is 210 Indicators for the TSCIS and 210 Gauges for the T5 for a total of 95 aircraft plus spares, two (2) Indicators to support the CH-46E System Integration Laboratory, and two (2) Indicators with associated drawings and cables for Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) testing, for a total of 214 instruments for the TSCIS and 214 gauges for the upgraded T5 as well.  The engine performance instruments will be procured over a three-year period.  The contract will be firm-fixed price with a base year and two (2) option years.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), Federal Facilities Enforcement Office (FFEO) intends to award  fixed-price performance based purchase order under the authority of  the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures toprovide electronic, web-based training relating to underground storage tank federal regulations.
Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capabilities statement, which if received by the response date of this announcement may be considered.  A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing and fax to US EPA, Attn: Sheila Fagan  (202)565-2554, or sent by email to fagan.sheila@epa.gov.  Responses to this notice must be submitted in writing after this electronic posting and prior to June 20, 2008 noon. Please include your name, point of contact, address, area code and telephone number, facsimile number and DUNS number. Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.
Statement of ObjectivesUST Web ?Based Training And Enforcement Compendium Presentation
Purpose:  The purpose of this solicitation is to acquire electronic, web-based training to ensure federal facility and EPA agency personnel have the knowledge and understanding to achieve and maintain compliance with federal underground storage tank (UST) regulations.
Scope: The goal of this effort is to effectively convey UST training and enforcement materials, in an electronic format available on the internet at the FedCenter website. The training must address federal regulatory compliance at federal facilities across the nation and provide an understanding of management techniques that will facilitate regulatory compliance for owners, operators and managers of federal USTs. The training is not to be designed to address state UST regulatory requirements. 
In a separate but closely related effort, existing enforcement materials for EPA personnel contained in the Underground Storage Tank (UST) Enforcement Compendium (see /www.fedcenter.gov ? EPA Enforcement Focus ? UST) should be presented in a user-friendly, web-based format. 
Period of Performance: Date of award to December 30, 2008
Background: The Federal Facilities Enforcement Office (FFEO) is EPA's front-line office for ensuring that Federal agencies and facilities take all necessary actions to prevent, control, and abate environmental pollution.  FFEO takes an active role in providing compliance assistance to the Federal sector, including agencies, bureaus, services, commands and field-level facilities.   FFEO also reviews available information to identify Federal sector deficiencies in applying regulatory and Executive Order compliance requirements to activities at Federal facilities.  The development of methods and techniques to resolve environmental regulatory compliance deficiencies and the transfer of that information to other agencies and facilities is key to assuring a strong environmental compliance program throughout the federal community and meeting FFEO's mission.  

EPA's Federal facility program headquarters and regional offices focus their work on several important areas where Federal agencies appear to have poor compliance records and where poor environmental management practices will lead to non compliance and have detrimental impacts on our Nation's environment.  FFEO's goal is to improve compliance through a number of methods including assisting agencies and facilities better understand regulatory compliance requirements and appropriate enforcement response where necessary.  Meeting the goal of improved compliance through the delivery of relevant training in an electronic, web-based format is one of FFEO's programmatic goals for FY08 and FY09.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (E-Pact) established new statutory requirements specifically designed to improve the environmental management of federal facility underground storage tanks (USTs).  In response to the E-Pact, EPA contracted to have training developed regarding proper management of USTs to ensure federal facilities understood the legal requirements applicable to USTs as well as the operational methods to achieve and maintain compliance over time.  Further, in FY07 and FY08 EPA paid for the "live" delivery of the UST training materials at workshops in thirteen locations across the United States.  Demand for the training was considerable and workshops were consistently full with waiting lists to attend.  It is clear that demand for the materials used in the workshops exceeded the capability of EPA to sponsor and host the training at additional locations and that additional delivery provisions were necessary.  In addition, EPA was required to increase inspection and enforcement activities related to federal underground storage tanks.  A compendium of the relevant instructions for enforcement actions was developed to assist EPA personnel with this task.  While the compendium is available, a web-based, user friendly presentation of the document would facilitate its use.
Requirements:  The requirements in this contract are considered performance-based, focusing on the Agency's desired results and outcomes.  The contractor shall be responsible for determining the most effective means by which the requirements will be fulfilled.  In order to fulfill the requirements, the contractor shall determine innovative and effective processes that can deliver the required services in a manner that will best meet the Agency's program objectives as described herein
Program objectives:  FFEO expects that provision of web-based training and information transfer will enhance federal agency compliance with UST regulations in several ways.  The training will result in improved federal agency staff knowledge and understanding of UST regulations and thereby improved compliance at federally operated tanks.   The training will not specifically address state regulations which may be more stringent and vary from federal requirements.   It will lead to improved knowledge and implementation of successful management practices to ensure employee competency and management awareness of critical UST operational elements.  The training will also result in an understanding of pollution prevention and environmental management system principles applicable to UST management.  As part of these activities, FFEO has an objective of greater use by the federal community of electronic, web-based training that compliments existing on-line resources as well as a goal of increased use of FedCenter for electronic training delivery and the ability to measure effectiveness of the UST online training in informing those accessing the training.
The training should  provide an overview of the UST and Leaking UST (LUST) programs including; 1) regulatory history, 2) regulatory overview,  3) detailed discussion of E-Pact, 4) UST operator and employee training requirements and 5) program issues and challenges.  It should also provide information on UST systems and associated specific regulatory requirements including; 1) components of an UST system, 2) materials of UST components, 3) methods of release detection and, 4) release prevention for UST systems.  The training should cover UST operation and maintenance and associated regulatory requirements including: 1) leak detection for tanks and piping, 2) upgrade requirements including spill, overfill and corrosion protection, 3) reporting and recordkeeping, 4) emergency response, 5) product compatibility and, 6) closure/correction action. Finally, the training should briefly cover the relationship between environmental management system implementation and operation of USTs and promote the UST/EMS "crosswalk" attached to this document as well as describe any actions associated with necessary procurement/purchasing to ensure proper UST tank operation.  
While the contractor may propose any structure to presentation of the training materials, the four areas above represent desired general content areas.  It is anticipated that on line presentation of each area of discussion will permit those taking the training to navigate to desired specific modules within an area and that most modules with the course will take between 10 and 15 minutes ? less if appropriate.
The training should utilize current training industry adult learning and training formats and processes including interactive training, quizzes to determine competence, the ability to provide a certificate upon successful completion of the training and other methods to ensure viewer attention and interaction.  The final training will be posted at the FedCenter website and early and continual coordination with FedCenter personnel to ensure compatibility with the website's software is vital to the success of this effort. 
As a related goal, in addition to and separate from the web-based training, FFEO needs to ensure that the materials and links in the Underground Storage Tank (UST) Enforcement Compendium (see /www.fedcenter.gov ? EPA Enforcement Focus ? UST) are available on FedCenter, the EPA internet and intranet in a user-friendly, web-based format. The goal of this part of the effort is an interactive tool that will assist regulators, primarily case development officers and attorneys, in understanding the potential enforcement pathways and options available to address non-compliance identified during inspections and assist the user in understanding and navigating the UST administrative enforcement process. The enhanced UST Compendium will be posted at FedCenter, and both EPA's internet and intranet sites in an effort to provide maximum exposure and usage by EPA staff and the UST community. We expect that once the enhanced document is available, it will serve as a toolkit where all regulators can find samples of various documents associated with each step of the enforcement process. While the primary audience would be EPA enforcement personnel, the enhanced compendium will also provide information to other regulators and the regulated community on EPA's UST enforcement process.  
Performance Standards ? Monitoring Technique and Incentives
Performance standard 1: The contractor shall develop training materials necessary to provide federal underground storage tank operators with adequate knowledge to comply with federal underground storage tank regulations.  
Monitoring Technique 1: The project officer will ensure that draft materials (subject matter) prepared for the training are reviewed by EPA program office personnel to confirm that the materials reflect current UST regulations.
Incentive 1: If the materials do not correctly reflect UST regulations and require preparation of an additional draft, $500 will be deducted from the contract.
Performance standard 2: The contractor shall ensure that the training format developed can be easily delivered by the FedCenter website for use by the Federal community.
Monitoring Technique 2: The project officer will work with EPA representatives for the FedCenter site to determine if unanticipated changes are necessary to the FedCenter site to accommodate the training format.
Incentive 2: If the training format requires changes or alterations to FedCenter software or hardware, the cost of those changes over $1000 will be deducted from the contract.  Constraints: The training delivery must be compatible with hardware and software capabilities of FedCenter.  There may be considerable variation in state regulatory requirements for UST and the training must address and explain this circumstance. The training should address the minimum requirements for Class A, B, and C, operators identified in EPA's Grant Guidelines to States for Implementing the Operator Training Provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005  (EPA510-R-07-005).

The studies and analysis FFRDC shall conduct its business in a manner befitting its special relationship with the Government; i.e., to operate with objectivity and be free from conflicts-of-interest, to fully disclose its affairs to its sponsors, and to serve the unique needs of its sponsors, while holding its full confidence and trust. Any subsidiary relationship the studies and analysis  FFRDC may have with a parent organization or consortia of organizations must demonstrate and maintain strict safeguards from conflicts of interest with such parent organizations. Work performed by the studies and analysis  FFRDC for non-DHS customers may be performed only with the explicit permission of DHS (S&T). 
 4. The studies and analysis  FFRDC Contractor shall provide all required and necessary space, equipment, support and technical personnel (except that as may be Government furnished) to establish, set up and manage the studies and analysis FFRDC. Performance of the studies and analysis  FFRDC management function required under the contract will take place in the Washington DC metropolitan areas, with the exception of assignees to field operations. 
 5. The work to be performed under this contract will involve access to, handling of, and generation of classified information up to, and including, Top Secret and sensitive compartmented information (SCI). 
 6. The Contractor shall provide a wide range of functions, including:

The intent of the studies and analysis FFRDC is to provide long-term, independent and objective advice to the government, using technical talent that is generally not available inside the government.  The studies and analysis FFRDC will provide support to all major DHS components in an integrative and cross-cutting manner, with other DHS FFRDCs, so that over time DHSs FFRDCs will provide greater synergy, best practices, and lessons learned in relevant areas.  The studies and analysis  FFRDC will operate in a manner that is free of real and perceived conflicts of interest through the rigorous application of corporate firewalls and personnel conflict of interest and non-disclosure agreements approved by the DHS. Corporate entities that operate the DHS National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures center (NBACC) or receive an award to operate the proposed DHS FFRDC for system engineering and development institute (SEDI) shall not be eligible to operate the studies and analysis  FFRDC, so that the DHS FFRDCs may be used to provide independent and objective cross validation as necessary.
 7. This studies and analysis FFRDC contract has an anticipated award date on or about December 2008.  It is anticipated that the studies and analysis  FFRDC will be provided approximately $10M in annual "core" funding but will subsist primarily on task orders from the major DHS operating components. The annual core funding shall be used to develop an annual research plan to address the most critical issues of the Department --particularly those efforts that require a cross-cutting approach to understand issues and formulate solutions. The studies and analysis  FFRDC workload is anticipated not to exceed 200 Staff-years of technical effort (STE) annually. 
8.  DHS requests comments on this Notice of Intent to Sponsor a Federally Funded Research and Development Center for Studies and Analysis.  Any comments should be submitted electronically to s&a_ffrdc@hq.dhs.gov.  Comments must be received on or before September 11, 2008.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The Department of Veterans Affairs Nebraska Western Iowa Health Care System (NWIHCS) intends to negotiate a commercial (FAR Part 12) sole source contract with Kent Scientific under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) FAC 2005-25. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  A justification for other than full and open competition is being prepared in support of this acquisition.ITEMS BEING PROCURED ARE AS FOLLOWS: (1) CODA 8 Computerized Controller with Automatic Inflation/Deflation Pump; (2) CODA 8 Data Acquisition Software with Automatic Blood Pressure; (3) Animal holders with nose cones, Rat - Large, 300-500g; (4) Animal holders with nose cones, Rat - Extra Large, 500-850g; (5) Animal Warming Platforms with built-in infrared warming system; (6) Data Acquisition System Laptop-style computer; (7) Custom CODA table stand; (8) Intra-Scan Thermometer, Non-contact infrared sensor with digital read-out; (9) VPR Sensor & Occlusion Cuff Accessory Kits - Large; and (10) VPR Sensor & Occlusion Cuff Accessory Kits - Extra Large.RATIONALE FOR SOLE-SOURCE PURCHASE:  The CODA 8 System is a computerized, non-invasive tail-cuff system that can quickly perform multiple simultaneous measurements on up to eight animals without operator intervention.  The CODA 8 automatically performs rapid multiple measurements of six parameters - systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, mean pressure, heart pulse rate, blood volume and blood flow.  This system is the only non-invasive system that utilizes a proprietary, patent pending tail-cuff technology, Volume Pressure Recording (VPR) to non-invasively measure blood pressure in rodents.  The system has been clinically validated and is supported by numerous peer-reviewed publications.  It has been shown to measure systolic blood pressure with 99% correlation to telemetry and invasive blood pressure measurements.  Consequently, this is the basis of the Sole-Source Justification.THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  All proposals received by 4:00 P.M. Central Time, June 18th, 2008, will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The objective of this notice is to seek out small business contractors who show interest in providing the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) with contractor support to conduct detailed Financial Capacity Assessments (FCAs) for projects seeking Section 5309 New Starts funds.  FCAs entail a review of the financial condition and capacity of the sponsoring agency considering a New Starts investment, and the level and stability of local financial commitment towards the project.  49 U.S.C. Chapter 53 Section 5309 contains criteria for determining whether New Start projects are eligible for funding.  The FCA also considers the grantees system-wide financial capacity, assessing future operations and infrastructure maintenance needs, as well as requirements to replace capital assets on a regular basis.  Previous FTA policy was to conduct FCAs of all proposed New Starts projects prior to award of a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA).  FTA has altered this policy and is now performing them prior to approving a project into final design.  In this way, grantees can be made aware earlier in the process of any significant financial issues or concerns that must be addressed prior to receipt of an FFGA.  For all tasks, the small business contractor shall assist FTA in providing technical assistance to the project sponsor with regards to identified deficiencies and provide the associated procedural guidance.  FTA is looking for small business contractors to provide assistance with transit planning and analysis experience.  Firms who are able to provide the detailed assessments needed to make such determinations will be considered.  All small business concerns that are able to provide the services described above, are encouraged to forward their capability statement (not to exceed 5 pages) to the point of contact (POC) identified below. Capability statements are to be submitted electronically, no later than June 25, 2008 to the Primary Point of Contact (POC) identified below. All sources will be added to the solicitation mailing list and notified when the agency synopsizes the requirement in the Government Point of Entry (GPE). The GPE may be accessed via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov .

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of potential small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) that can provide the following analytical report:

Project Title:  Radio-Synthesis of 11C-docetaxel suitable for human administration

Background:  Docetaxel has value in the treatment of several tumors, including  breast and lung cancer. It would be especially desirable to identify those tumors that are likely to be sensitive to docetaxel in a disease such as breast cancer, because there are many alternative drugs that could be used if docetaxel were ineffective. Several determinants for the antitumor activity of docetaxel are known.  However, the most readily investigated mechanisms of sensitivity or resistance to docetaxel appear to be the steps of cellular uptake and efflux. Because the sensitivity of tumor cells to docetaxel is directly linked to the amount of drug that collects inside the cell, positron-labeled docetaxel might be useful as a probe for noninvasive external imaging of the uptake and retention of docetaxel. The ability of tracer amounts of radiolabeled docetaxel to evaluate the net effect of these two transport steps with this single probe is potentially a powerful tool to improve response rates and decrease unnecessary toxicity by matching drugs and tumors.

The Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology at FDA has developed a micro-synthesis using CO2 as the donor to form the tert-butylcarbonate group on the side chain connected to the main Baccatin moiety. 11C-CO2 is a common cyclotron product that can be used with this method to generate 11C-docetaxel.  

The contractor must have access to a cyclotron and have sufficient experience in 11C production and synthetic chemistry to generate the 11C starting material and 11C-docetaxel final product.

Statement of Work:  The contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, services, materials, and otherwise perform all necessary functions, in the performance of the work as described below.  The primary amine form of precursor is available from the Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology at the FDA.

I.	Work closely with the project officer and study liaison throughout the lifespan of the contract.

II.	The contractor shall synthesize 11C-docetaxel based on the procedure developed by the Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology (LCP) at FDA and at other sites. 
a.	The contractor will perform the synthesis of 11C-docetaxel following the procedure developed by LCP. The procedure uses 11CO2 mixed with potassium tert-butoxide followed by the addition of methanesulfonyl chloride to produce 11C-di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (diBOC). The docetaxel precursor is reacted to complete the synthesis 11C-docetaxel.

b.	The contractor shall follow alternate synthesis methods of 11C-docetaxel from published literature or developed at their site to compare with the procedure described in 2a. The radiolabeled carbon may be in the form of 11CO2 or other forms of 11C. 

The synthetic process that is most facile with the least steps or shortest synthesis time and yields the most 11C-docetaxel will be used for isolation and purification steps suggested in 3 below.


III.	The contractor is required to purify the 11C-docetaxel after it is made. The suggestion is that the contractor follow procedure IIIa however the contractor may think of a better way to purify the 11C-docetaxel. IIIb allows the contractor to perform a different purification if the contractor so chooses. If it is confusing then IIIa and IIIb can be omitted keeping only III.


a.	The reaction mix from 2a or 2b is dried and then dissolved in a small volume of 40% ethyl alcohol. It is passed through a strong cation solid phase exchange column (SPE) followed by more 40% ethyl alcohol. The pooled elutions are diluted with water and passed through a C18 SPE, washed with water, and eluted with MeOH. The MeOH elution containing the 11C-docetaxel is dried and a final purification step is performed by peak collection from HPLC.

b.	The contractor may develop and follow alternate purification methods of the reaction mix from 2a or 2b.

III.	The contractor will optimize the full procedure from isotope generation to final injectable product while maintaining records of failed attempts and successful improvements.

IV.	Show that a sufficient quantity of final product can be produced with a specific activity and product quality required for patient imaging. 

The Period of Performance to be determined.  The contract will be awarded for 1 year.

Deliverables:

The contractor shall issue monthly status reports to the project officer and study liaison indicating the progress since the last report.  Due at the end of each month.  

At the completion of the project the contractor shall provide 
I.	Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for the complete optimized production, synthesis, and purification processes under the Scope of Work above.  Due 30 days after the completion of the project. 
II.	Final report to include a summation of the results of the monthly reports and conclusions drawn from the findings.   Due 30 days after the completion of the project.
III.	 Reports shall be submitted in wordformat electronically via email upon due date.

The performance period will be one year from the time of award.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of potential small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses) that can provide the following analytical report:<p>

Project Title:  Development of Quality by Design (QbD) Case Studies and Guidance Elements on Parenteral Dosage Forms<p>

Purpose:  To reach a better understanding of the concept of Quality by Design (QbD) and how this can be applied to the most common parenteral manufacturing processes.  <p>

Background:  Pharmaceutical manufacturing is going through a major transition from quality assessment by testing the product at the end of manufacture to the more holistic control strategy of Quality by Design (QbD) and Process Analytical Technology (PAT).  There is greater realization that an enhanced understanding of the pharmaceutical processes involved in product manufacture and in particular, appreciation of criticality of the process steps and the critical process parameters that control each of these steps are of vital importance to ensuring quality of manufactured products.    With the advent of QbD, each pharmaceutical company is likely to implement science and risk based approaches to evaluate its own processes, determine their critical steps and necessary controls and establish a design space for each process.  It is essential therefore, that companies have a common understanding to make the review process more consistent.<p>

Description of Work: <p>
The design for the study is shown in Figure 1 below.   A typical Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) that is widely available and is representative will be picked for this study. <p>

<li>1. Define the Critical Product Attributes of the Target Product Profile.  The target product profile would include:
a.	Assay
i.	API source and control strategy 

b.	Complete recovery of API activity upon reconstitution
For small molecules, this is generally not a problem.  For large molecules, and particularly for vaccines, it can be an unrealistic goal, and we can only strive for consistent recovery of activity. In cases where the concentration of formulation excipients is very low, or where organic co-solvent systems are used, powder ejection from the vial during freeze drying can be a significant issue

c.	Reconstitution
i.	Influence of formulation components 
ii.	Thermal history of freezing 
iii.	Potential effect of collapse, or micro-collapse, on reconstitution time 

d.	Freedom from extraneous particulate matter
i.	May be related to slow, or incomplete, reconstitution 
Instability of freeze-dried solid can lead to particulate matter in reconstituted solid 

e.	Stability
i.	Effect of residual moisture in freeze-dried solid 
Potential for transfer of moisture from stopper to freeze fried solid
ii.	Effect of vial headspace composition
 
<li>2. Propose a formulation using key formulation design decisions. 
<li>3. Propose the manufacturing process. 
<li>4. Conduct a risk analysis using cause and effect process (Ishikawa diagram) to identify the variables that are like to impact the manufacturing process. 
<li>5. Risk Evaluation  classify the unit operations that are likely to have an impact on quality. 
<li>6. Identify the critical operating variables and material property variables that are like to have the maximum impact on the Critical Product Attributes. (Risk evaluation study using Risk = probability X impact and FMEA) 
<li>7. Design of Experiments.
<li>8. Conduct the experiments in laboratory/pilot plant equipment. 
<li>9. Develop Formulation Design Space and Lyophilizer Design Space. 
<li>10. Propose control strategy to reduce risk. <p>

Deliverables:<p>
<li>1. Monthly teleconferences shall be on the 1st day of the month in the mornings (TBD). 
a.	Shall maintain an on-going dialogue by communicating with the project officer & key study personnel via e-mail or telephone as necessary in order to provide periodic updates of study progress, status, and interim results related to various phases of the study.
<li>2. Quarterly project reports in Word document shall be submitted to the project officer & key study personnel by the first day of the month (Q1 for method development, Q2 for formulation optimization, Q3 for process optimization, Q4 for final report). 
a.	Keep and maintain all raw data collected during the performance of the study in laboratory notebooks and/or CDROM.
<li>3. A final report in Word document shall be submitted to the project officer & key study personnel two weeks prior to the end of the 12-month time period of the study.
<li>4. Presentation at the FDA of the final results shall be two weeks after the 12-month time period of the study.
<li>5. Expect 1-day site visit from the project officer and/or key study personnel at vendor site at the 3-month and 9-month time periods of the study.
<li>6. Vendor shall visit FDA facility in Silver Spring, Maryland for seminar presentation in PowerPoint format and/or for face-to-face discussion of the project at the 11-month time period of the study.
<li> 7. FDA retains full data rights to all information related to this study, including any subcontract works.  

<p>Performance period: one year from the time of award.  <p>

<DESC>I.          PROJECT TITLE

Support for NHTSA Three-Prong Youth Traffic Safety Strategy

II.        STATEMENT OF WORK

A.        Background

The leading cause of death for young people 15 to 20 years old is motor vehicle crashes. The teen motor vehicle crash fatality ratemore than 5,000 teen occupant deaths per yearis high no matter how it is calculated (per 100,000,000 vehicle miles traveled by teens; per 100,000 licensed teen drivers; or per 100,000 teens in the population).  As the data shows, young drivers are substantially over-involved in crashes, more than any other single age group.

The high teen traffic fatality rate may be attributable to both inexperienced driving and a greater propensity for risk taking behaviors.  For instance, while teens are learning the new skills needed for driving, many frequently engage in high-risk behaviors such as speeding and/or driving after using alcohol or other drugs, and not wearing their safety belts.  National observation surveys consistently indicate that teens have the lowest belt use rate of any age group.  Studies have also shown that teens are easily distracted while driving, especially by other teen passengers.  

Adding to the severity of the teen traffic problem is this populations rate of growth.  The number of teens in the United States increased 12 percent since 1993 and is expected to continue to increase by several percent each year.  Unless effective measures are implemented to reduce the teen traffic fatality rate, it can be expected that teen deaths will increase along with the population. 

THE FACTS

	In 2006, 7,463 15-to-20-year-old drivers were involved in fatal crashes, with 3,490 drivers ages 15 to 20 losing their lives, and an additional 272,000 injured.
	In 2006, 12.9 percent of all drivers in fatal crashes were between the ages of 15 and 20.
	Among the drivers ages 15 to 20 killed in motor vehicle crashes in 2006, 28 percent had been drinking
	More than 3 out of 5 teen (ages 16-20) passenger vehicle occupants killed were unrestrained.  This compares to 54% unrestrained rate for adult fatalities (ages 21+).
Teens (ages 15-20) are at risk, and pose dangers to themselves and to other drivers.  As an age group, they are overrepresented in fatal crashes and, more so than adults, tend not to be buckled up in fatal crashes.  Their inexperience behind the wheel, combined with high speed and their propensity to undertake risky behaviors such as drinking and driving, is a frightening combination.  The risks go beyond the teen themselves; nearly two of every three people killed in teen-driver crashes are people other than the teen driver. Unless a more comprehensive national youth strategy is undertaken, these trends will continue to take the lives of more than 5,000 teen lives per year. 

The teen motor vehicle crash problem is multifaceted and requires a comprehensive strategy.  Like other age groups, teens are influenced by many factors. They are unique, however, in their social and emotional development, decision-making capabilities, and their preferences for message content and delivery. Contributing to the complexity of developing teen strategies is recent research by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism that found the human brain continues to develop into the early 20s, with the limbic system (emotions) developing first, followed by the frontal cortex, which affects self-control and moral development.
NHTSAs youth traffic safety programs reflect the consensus among safety and behavioral experts that the most effective strategies for modifying youth behavior utilize approaches that affect individuals, their social situation and their environment.  NHTSA efforts to reduce teen motor vehicle injuries and fatalities focus on these key strategies and are supported by research and evaluation.
	Environmental Countermeasures:  Environmental restrictions provide a framework for teens to operate within that will protect them from often unfortunate choices. Examples of environmental countermeasures include State laws and policies regarding youth driving (e.g., graduated driver licensing (GDL) laws, zero tolerance laws), enforcement of traffic laws including speed laws, and regulatory actions (e.g., keg registration laws, fines for selling alcohol to minors).

Young drivers are subject to two traffic laws that apply only to them: GDL and the zero tolerance BAC laws. In addition, they are subject to all other traffic laws.  Enforcement is critical if these laws are to have any effect. The law enforcement system faces two problems when dealing with young drivers. First, in some situations there may be a tendency for officers not to make arrests or for prosecutors to dismiss charges because the offender is just a kid. Second, the legal system imposes additional requirements for people under the age of legal adulthood (18 in most States).  Third, it may be difficult for officers to determine age of the driver unless a stop is made.  In this case, strongly enforced parental house rules are even more critical.

	Communication and Outreach to Teens: Teens are unique in how they absorb information and are bombarded by messaging in nearly every aspect of their lives.  Even in the face of recent research suggesting the areas of a teens brain which affect self-control and moral development continue to develop into the early 20s, teens have an uncanny ability (more so than any other previous generation of teens) to multi-task and filter out the clutter.  Communication efforts to teens should work to lower a teens natural defense mechanism to messaging focused on safety, as these messages are typically perceived as being overly parental or authoritative.  Campaign themes or concepts should strive to be unique, may incorporate humor or edginess as appropriate, but should still take into account teen preferences and core values.  Teen-specific messages should also take advantage of the many new and constantly changing informational channels that exist with advances in technology.  While communication and education alone rarely change youth behaviors, they are often effective in combination with other strategies; for instance, combining a media campaign on buckling up with high-visibility enforcement of safety belt laws.  
 
	Communication and Outreach to Teens Social Network: Teen behavior can be influenced through key social contacts, including both parents and peers.  In the younger teen years, teens tend to be more receptive to parental guidance and thus more amenable to parental influences, including the establishment of clear behavioral expectations and compliance monitoring (e.g., Be home by 8:00., You need to finish your homework.). Communication efforts to parents of teen drivers and passengers may prove even more effective as they are the ones who can enforce house rules regarding teen driving.  As teens develop, the need for acceptance within the peer group is an incredibly powerful force and the desire to fit in can sometimes outweigh the need for rationale, safe behavior.   Creating exposure to social norming techniques, including the peer network, reinforces and validates the message(s) teens are hearing and helps to reinforce desirable behaviors.

Parental responsibility: Parents play a key role in their teenagers driving. In many States a parent or guardian must sign the drivers license application for a teenager under 18 and parents can withdraw their approval at any time. Parents can set limits on their teenagers driving. Through their own driving, parents provide role models for good or bad driving practices. Parents can be involved explicitly and formally, through GDL requirements for a minimum number of hours of supervised driving practice under a learners permit. Or they can be involved voluntarily and informally. Several parent-teen driving guide programs can provide assistance.  Parents can influence belt use through role modeling and house rules requiring their use.  Parents can also play a significant role in limiting youth access to alcohol through positive role modeling, monitoring home activity, and checking on their teens when outside the home.

NHTSA uses this comprehensive array of approaches across a number of countermeasure areas that deal with specific risk behaviors.  Teens are positively affected by many traffic safety initiatives that are not directed specifically at this age group  for example primary seat belt laws and sobriety checkpoints  as well as by youth-focused programs.  

Over the next two years NHTSA will be developing a series of campaign materials focused on reaching the parents of teen drivers and passengers.  These materials will be available on NHTSAs website, but NHTSA has not yet developed plans for paid media placement of the materials or grassroots outreach. The purpose of this contract is to promote and distribute the NHTSA campaign through organizations that have direct contact with parents and teens to make sure the messages reach their intended audience.  This results in more information being shared directly with the groups that will most benefit and with which NHTSA does not have direct contact.  NHTSAs website will have the materials, but the placement of materials by local groups through local media or using other communication tools is often more effective since there is a local connection that ensures delivery.  

B.         Purpose

The purpose of this effort is to solicit the services of a national non-profit youth serving organization that has an extensive history and experience with traffic safety issues for youth and has the ability to promote and coordinate the dissemination and marketing of NHTSAs Three-Prong Approach to Youth Traffic Safety materials to a broad array of national organizations, including those that reach diverse and minority populations, that can more directly reach out to the population of parents and their teen drivers.  The components to be promoted and distributed include, but are not limited to the following:

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking sources to manage and staff DHSs proposed Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute (HS SEDI or SEDI) in accordance with requirements delineated below.    

 MANDATE AND GOVERNANCE 

The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Section 305 of P.L. 107-296, as codified in 6 U.S.C. 185) (herein referred to as the Act), authorized the Secretary, acting through the Under Secretary for Science and Technology, to establish one or more federally funded research and development centers (FFRDC) to provide independent analysis of homeland security issues, or to carry out other responsibilities under the Act. The HS SEDI is intended to provide high-level technical support to DHS that is normally not available within the Government for systems engineering / development and lifecycle management of major homeland security programs, and resource support analyses for DHS components.

The HS SEDI shall consult widely with representatives from private industry, institutions of higher education, and nonprofit institutions and incorporate, to the extent practicable, information and perspectives derived from such consultations in carrying out its work.

Please see Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 35.017, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, for qualification and policy regulations, http://www.arnet.gov/far/.

 DHS SPONSORS CONCEPT OF THE HS SEDI 

DHS Components (hereinafter referred to as the Sponsors) conceive that the HS SEDI will operate as follows:    

*  While DHS S&T is the primary sponsor of the HS SEDI, any DHS Component choosing to use the HS SEDIs services should be viewed as the sponsor for its respective tasks. In general, DHS Components will provide specific technical direction and oversight while DHS S&T will provide general technical, business, financial, and contractual oversight.

*  The HS SEDI shall meet the special research and analysis needs of its DHS sponsors, whether short-term or long-term, that cannot be met as effectively by using existing in-house or normal contractor resources. The HS SEDI shall provide its DHS sponsors with a network of institutional and individual sources of expertise that could not be contained within a single organization. The HS SEDI shall inform its DHS sponsors and other government policymakers using objective, independent, and high-quality analysis and assembly of information rather than taking advocacy positions.  

*  The HS SEDI shall conduct its business in a manner befitting its special long-term relationship with the Government (i.e., to operate with objectivity and be free from conflicts of interest, to fully disclose its affairs to its DHS sponsors, and to serve the unique needs of its DHS sponsors while holding their full confidence and trust).



  MANAGEMENT PLAN  

The Contractor shall provide the necessary space, equipment, and support and technical personnel to establish, set up, and manage the HS SEDI. Contractor management and at least 50% of the full time staff are to be located in the Washington DC metropolitan area. Other staff may be assigned to field offices, including contractor activities, to provide independent analysis in support of systems engineering and development efforts.  As further described in Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) 3052.204-71, Contractor staff requiring recurring access to Government facilities or access to sensitive information or IT resources are required to have a favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to commencing work at the HS SEDI. 

The Contractor will also implement a broad-based consultative strategy to extend beyond its in-house staff and include perspectives from experts in industry, academia, and the non-profit sector.

The Contractor shall be responsible for planning and executing such systems engineering and development program analysis as the DHS sponsors may specify.  Such systems engineering and development tasks may include, quick-response, ad-hoc analysis and technical support, short-term studies (up to one month), and medium-term studies (1-12 months). However, most HS SEDI tasks are expected to be long-term studies (more than 1 year) that track with DHS sponsors major acquisition program lifecycles.  

The Contractor shall provide a wide range of high-level research, studies, analyses, analytic and computational models, simulations, and other technical and analytical support useful for the development of major homeland security programs.  The work will be focused in the SEDI core competencies &#9472; systems engineering and development, lifecycle management, and resource support analyses &#9472; which draw heavily on the disciplines of engineering (all disciplines), IT/software engineering, test and evaluation, logistics and data configuration management, and systems engineering.  Within and across these core areas, DHS sponsors specific needs are expected to evolve over time, and the HS SEDIs capabilities and areas of concentration will evolve accordingly.  Specific task orders will address major DHS program issues.  A surcharge of up to 5% may be charged against task orders for DHS cross cutting research and development.

The Contractor will be subject to independent audits by a Government accounting agency, the DHS Inspector General, and/or the Government Accountability Office.  The Contractor shall be responsible for hiring a certified public accounting firm to conduct: (1) annual financial audits of the operations of the HS SEDI (and certify annual financial statements), and (2) all audits required by law or applicable regulation.


TASKS FOR OTHER THAN THE DHS SPONSORS    

It is not the Governments intent that an FFRDC use its privileged information or access to facilities to compete with the private sector.  However, the HS SEDI may perform work for a non-sponsor provided such work is in compliance with FAR 35.017-3 and applicable DHS policies.  

  This is allowable, provided:    

* The task is consistent with the purpose, mission, general scope of effort, or special competency of the HS SEDI. 
* The HS SEDI has received the prior written approval of DHS. 
* Funding for the projects has been transferred from the funding agency or agencies to DHS for disbursement under the HS SEDI contract. 
* The HS SEDI and the tasking agency or agencies agree to fully disclose all aspects of the work being performed, including draft documents, to DHS upon request.

<DESC>The Engineering Research and Development Center, Topographic Engineering Center (TEC), Alexandria Contracting Office is conducting a Request For Information (RFI) Sources Sought (SS) for English-to-Available Foreign Language and Available Foreign Language-to-English automated document translation for the U.S. Army Space Programs Office, Program Manager Sequoyah, Alexandria, VA.<BR><BR>This request for information is for planning purposes only; this is not a request for Quotations or Proposals.  No solicitation document exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI/SS.  The Government will not be liable for payment of any response preparation expenses.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. All interested firms that possess the capabilities and facilities addressed herein are encouraged to respond to this RFI/SS by providing the information specified below, on or before 2:00 pm EST on June 26, 2008.  Responses to this RFI should be unclassified.  Sources responding to this RFI/SS should indicate their business size in relation to the following NAICS code:  334220.   Direct all questions regarding this RFI to the attention of Nilda Lugo, Contracting Officer, Fax number 703-428-6995, E-mail: Nilda.E.Lugo@usace.army.mil. All requests for further information must be via email, telephonic requests for additional information will not be honored.  <BR><BR>The Program Manager Sequoyah, under the Program Director, Army Space Program Office (ASPO) of Program Executive Officer (PEO) Intelligence and Electronics Warfare Systems (IEW&S) has an Operational Needs Statements (ONS) for automated foreign language translation capabilities from the Services and Combatant Commands in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), and the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).  In response to these ONS, PM Sequoyah will conduct Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) equippings during FY08.<BR><BR>The purpose of this RFI is to identify sources that are capable of satisfying an immediate need for production and deployment of the following capabilities.  In fulfilling the many requirements for material support tasked to the Sequoyah Program Office different solution sets (configurations, languages, and domains) will be considered.   <BR><BR>Interested parties should consider the following information in response to this RFI:<BR>	(a)  PM Sequoyah is interested in Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) configurations for One-Way Hands-Free Speech-to-Speech (HF 1WSTS), One-Way Handheld Speech-to-Speech (HH 1WSTS), Two-Way Handheld Speech-to-Speech (HH 2WSTS), and Two-Way Mobile (PC 2WSTS) translations systems.  <BR>	(b)  The technical readiness of the COTS technology and vendor manufacturing capability is important in order to meet the governments requirement to have units in theater within 60 days of any contract award.  <BR>	(c)  Hardware configurations characterized as laptop/tablet (PC) require both hands for operation in static conditions.  They may also have limited operation in mobile conditions.  Handheld (HH) configurations require a minimum of one hand for operation, and Hands-Free (HF) configurations operate on voice commands and are soldier wearable.  The degree of ruggedness for sustained operations in harsh environments and other human factors considerations engineered into the platform are of significant interest.    <BR>	(d) The languages for 1WSTS systems and 2WSTS systems (bidirectional language-pair with English) that are of interest to the Sequoyah Program for FY08 and beyond are:<BR>	1.  Iraqi-Arabic (sometimes referred to as Iraqi Colloquial Arabic)<BR>	2.  Modern Standard Arabic<BR>	3.  Persian-Afghan (Dari)<BR>	4.  Persian-Iranian (Farsi)<BR>	5.  Pashto<BR>	6.  Hangul<BR>	(e)  All languages for one-way systems and language-pairs for two-way translation systems should be portable as individual software modules, loadable on a standalone platform (either a one-way or two-way language translation system depending on the module) to operate.  The software language module should have a well-defined user interface that will enable it to be ported to the numerous platforms that meet the software language modules minimal specifications for operation.  Software language modules must be easily loaded in the field.  In addition to the portable software module form factor, the government is interested in the modules overall software architecture, the performance of the translation engine, any additional processing that enhances overall operation, and the potential ability to generate metadata for both input and output data streams (DDMS format).<BR>	(f)  The language-pair offerings should operate over the specified set of domains:   Force Protection that includes Checkpoint Operations, Base Security, Convoy Operations, Tactical Questioning, Internment and Detention, Combat Life Saving, and Combat Operations focused on Counterinsurgency.  Other military and non-military domains may be submitted by the vendor, but primary interest is in the thoroughness of the minimum set stated above.  The dialogues associated with an   individual domain are representative of those spoken by soldiers in executing the U.S. Army TRADOC tasks encompassing a particular domain.  These domains may be offered as one integrated dictionary on a single software language module or in a set of software modules, loadable on the translation system platform.  It is highly desirable to have the most compact modules possible without sacrificing translation quality.<BR>	(g) System operation and performance for automated language translation capabilities are of interest to the Sequoyah Program Office (its Engineering Staff and Testbed) before any acquisition is made.  The government is mostly interested in overall translation capability.  This includes:  translation accuracy, translation accuracy subject to noise conditions, language variations, output intelligibility, domain coverage, system robustness (translation repeatability), software stability, ease of use, user evaluation, operational evaluation, speed of operation, and ease of training.  The government is interested in any inputs from laboratory tests, recognized industry standards used for evaluating quality or accuracy, evaluations by military personnel and documented performance data supplied by the vendor on their systems (e.g., from a recognized government authority such as NIST, DARPA, and or DLI).        <BR>	(h)  Responders to this RFI who provide an unclassified white paper are encouraged to include descriptions of their corporate capabilities in the automated language translation field, past and current relevant performance information, available facilities and assets capable of 1WSTS and 2WSTS system production, current production rates for each COTS system, subcontractors and current methodology for managing them, identification of risks for delivery of systems, production locations and test plans and procedures currently in use, and configuration control procedures.   The responder is encouraged to provide information on related experiences important to the Program Office, e.g. Natural Language Processing (NLP); Automated Speech Recognition (ASR); automated bidirectional Machine Language Translation (MLT); development, integration and building prototype MLT systems; transitioning MLT systems from concept/laboratory to commercial market/field; knowledge of DoDs operational needs for MLT capabilities, including integration into a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), and ability to operate in a classified environment up to and including TS/SCI.<BR>	(j)  Responders to this RFI are requested to provide technical information on their COTS 1WSTS and 2WSTS systems to include functional modes, performance specifications, input and output audio signal levels, software component description (ASR, MT, TM, Dictionaries) and interfaces, languages available, hardware platforms for hosting the translation software, text output formats, hands-free operations, display, microphone, IO connectors, operating system, data storage, system specifications (including size) and operational parameters (temperature, moisture, shock, etc.), battery and power requirements, training options, technical support and documentation, upgradeability, and warranty information. <BR>	(k)  The Sequoyah Program Office is also interested in management parameters associated with the COTS equipment and requests the following information:<BR>	1.  Commercial catalog pricing and warranty information<BR>	2.  Strategic partnering alliances that would accelerate component delivery or allow for priority subcontracted support services<BR>	3.  Commercial/Industrial Certifications (meets a recognized software systems/data standard) or Quality Software Systems (Software Engineering Institute Carnegie Mellon University) in use<BR>	4.  Identification of existing customers for the offered system(s)<BR>	5.  Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the offered system(s) and certifying 	authority<BR>	6.  Contractor/Independent Authority lab/field assessments of offered COTS 	systems<BR>	7.  Point of contact for additional information.<BR>	<BR>Any submission of such product literature or catolog cut sheets will be treated separate from, and will have no bearing on, any subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting future formal Request for Proposal (RFP).  TEC will not pay for information or comments provided and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of comments.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to collect additional information regarding the prospect of small businesses in the shelter industry meeting an upcoming requirement for the Marine Corps General Purpose Medium Shelter.  The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is currently evaluating whether solicitation no. M67854-08-R-3025 should be issued as a total small business set-aside under the authority of FAR Part 19.502-2.  This RFI corresponds to the requirement synopsized in presolicitation notice no. M67854-08-R-3025, posted to the Navy Electronic Commerce Online website (https://www.neco.navy.mil) and the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov) on 22 April 2008, and is still available for viewing at each site.  As indicated in the presolicitation notice, MARCORSYSCOM Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense Systems, has a requirement for General Purpose Shelters with 512 to 650 square feet of floor space.  Shelters shall be mobile, durable, terrain-adaptable, all-weather, light-weight, have the ability to be quickly erected and struck, and be suitable for use in the wide range of environmental conditions encountered during military operations.  The NAICS code is 314912, Canvas and Related Product Mills, with a size standard of 500.  For planning purposes, the upcoming solicitation will include an estimated minimum of 200 to an estimated maximum of 3,400 shelters.  In response to this RFI, all interested small businesses having shelters they believe currently meet the requirements or in the alternative, have the ability/capability to submit a proposal/solution that can meet the Commercial Item Description (CID) provided as an attachment to this RFI notice, are requested to submit a capabilities statement electronically to lisandra.torres@usmc.mil.  Responses shall be no more than 10 pages in length.  DUE DATE:  These responses are due no later than 2:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time), 25 June 2008.  Interested small businesses who submitted a proposal in response to previously cancelled solicitation no. M67854-08-R-3003 are requested to also submit a capabilities statement in response to this RFI.  CONTENT:  These capabilities statements shall CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE how the proposed shelter meets all of the requirements of the attached CID.  If you do not currently possess a shelter that meets any of the particular requirements, responses shall provide a rationale as to how you intend to submit a proposal that can meet the requirement.  If the intended plan to meet the requirement entails modifying/altering a shelter currently in possession, capability statements shall also provide a necessary timeframe for making such modifications.  In order to also assess whether small businesses can offer fair and reasonable prices if this requirement were to be set aside for small businesses, all capabilities statements submitted shall also clearly state your estimated prices for these shelters.  All items, materials, and components used to construct these shelters shall be in full compliance with the Berry Amendment (10 U.S.C. 2533a).  Capabilities statements submitted shall certify that the proposed shelter is in full compliance with the Berry Amendment.  Interested parties shall also be able to meet the requirements of FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  Therefore, capabilities statements shall also state whether the shelter is being wholly manufactured by the interested party submitting the response or whether the shelter is being manufactured by a different vendor or vendors.  If the proposed shelter is being manufactured by other vendor(s), the response shall identify those vendor(s) and the percentage of the cost of manufacturing the item they are responsible for.  The requirements stated in presolicitation notice no. M67854-08-R-3025 still apply and will apply when the solicitation is issued.  Shelters will be evaluated against stringent Go/No-Go criteria, as stated in the presolicitation notice.

<DESC>The USCG C2CEN anticipates awarding a sole source contract for training and consulting. The rational is that this training and consulting is a follow-on to build on training and consulting that was given previous on this same special project.  Attached below is the Justification Document JFOC. This document has been saigned by the Div Chief andf the Warranted Contracting Officer. It is in the best interest of the USCG/Federal Government to award this contract for this training and consulting to American Training Alliance Cage Code 0SD56.


Justification for other than Full and Open Competition

Ref:  PR# 21-08-448THA332

Overview and Background
C2CENs System Life Cycle Management Plan (SLCMP) Implementation Team was chartered to address the following major objective in C2CENs 2008 Strategic Action Plan.
Establish (CY08) and then institutionalize (CY09) a standard business process to build integrated C2 products and deliver services that meet sponsor requirements on time, within budget, and in a repeatable fashion.
	Document the System Life Cycle Management Plan (SLCMP) and ensure alignment with COMDT policies including SDLC.
	Ensure that every C2CEN employee understands, has access, and follows all engineering development doctrine and processes.
	Each C2CEN branch and person understands their role/responsibility.
	Standardized project and budget execution aligned with SDLC.
	Align with other COE engineering development and support processes.

Our level of success on this objective will impact our ability to plan and take on additional work, respond to the Coast Guards Logistics Transformation, and establish C2CEN as the integrator for all command and control systems in the Coast Guard.  

Since February 26, 2008, Mr. Roger Kirkham has trained and consulted with our SLCMP Team to integrate his project management principles, CG-6's System Development and Life Cycle Plan (SDLC), and our System Life Cycle Management Plan (SLCMP) into C2CEN's first ever standard Project Management Process (PMP).  The team and C2CEN division officers are currently implementing his recommended C2CEN project roles and delivery plan.  

The final product will become a C2CEN Instruction, the cornerstone of C2CENs Project Manager Syllabus, and a strategy to address another strategic initiative, Standardize project management at all C4IT Centers of Excellence. (COEs)     

Item 4:	4 Days of Consulting with C2CENs SLCMP Implementation Team, July 29-Aug 01-2008. 

This is follow-up, evaluation, and continuation of the work that Mr. Kirkham started with C2CEN's SLCMP Implementation Team in Feb/2008 to design and implement standardized project management processes. Mr. Kirkham will facilitate, review and update C2CEN's implementation progress, documentation of standard project roles, and improved project and life cycle management processes that he and the team designed during the previous sessions.  Mr. Kirkman will also work with the team to finalize strategies for the first integrated course in September.


Item 1:	3 days training for C2CEN Product Leaders and Project Managers, Sept 09-11-2008.

The 3 day training course is a continuation of Mr. Kirkhams consulting work(that will take place in July/2008) with C2CEN SLCMP Implementation Team.   This course will be a C2CEN "Pilot/ Customized Course" where the Roles, Documentation, and Processes designed by him and the team are integrated into his Transforming Leadership, Project Management, and Incredibly Effective Communications courses for newly transferred in Product Leaders and Project Managers.  The final course will become a the cornerstone of C2CENs Project Manager Syllabus.

Item 2:	1 day training Incredibly Effective Communications.  

This day is an extra course offering of Incredibly Effective Communication Course that is open to all C2CEN personnel. It is felt that this course is an essential tool for C2CEN personnel both military and civilian to build communications skills, and will benefit the C2CEN in its long range projects.

Evaluations

Since 2006, Mr. Kirkham has conducted 4 Project Management Courses, 2 Managing Strategic Organizational Change Courses and 8 days of consulting.
Participant and team feedback has been extremely positive from all C2CEN personnel.  

Summary

As a licensed Engineer with knowledge and experience in Project Management, Organizational Systems, and Systems Life Cycle Management in private industry, government, and the military, especially the Coast Guard (MLCPAC, 11th/14th CG Districts and 4 CG Electronic Support Units) Mr. Kirkham is able provide an impartial view and evaluation of our work with a great deal of creditability.  He understands our organization, has built trusting relationships with key C2CEN personnel and has designed many of our project roles and processes.  In addition, C2CEN has adopted his project management model as the best fit for our organization.  

Since November 2007, the Systems Life Cycle Management Improvement Team (6 senior civilians and 2 officers) and command staff personnel have invested an estimated 400 hours toward this project.  This does not include the numerous peer reviews and interviews by many other C2CEN personnel.  The ramp up time for another consultant would cause delays, rework, and additional hours for our already busy personnel.  Mr. Kirkhams continuity is critical to the short and long term success of this strategic initiative for C2CEN.

Program and agrees that his/her duties will be carried out in such a manner as to be fully commensurate with the responsibilities that this entails.

The time proposed by the Contractor to complete the tube reconfigurationchanges and the protocol provided shall be evaluated for feasibility and consistency.  Test data submitted will be analyzed to further evaluate and confirm the ability of thesystem to meet or exceed the minimum specifications.In determining best value, consideration shall be given but not limited to: detectordynamic range that exceeds the minimum specifications; length of time required for x-raytube point/line reconfiguration, x-ray tube changes, and x-ray tube conditioning; x-raytube reconfiguration ergonomics; the extent of system expandability; the terms andconditions of the warranty for both the overall instrument and the x-ray tubes.The awardee is required to have a technically acceptable offer and have acceptable pastperformance. Technical acceptability will be determined by a review of the informationsubmitted by the offeror providing a description in sufficient detail to show that theproduct offered meets the Government's requirement (see specifications above).	It iscritical that offerors provide adequate detail to allow evaluation of their offer.  (SEEFAR 52.212-1(b)).

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation&nbsp;for the following services for NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service.&nbsp;Finalize data management tools and products for the Integrated Status and Effectiveness monitoring Program in the Columbia River Basin.</p>
<p>Background and Objectives, The Center provides scientific and technical support to NMFS for the management, conservation, and wise-use of the Northwest region's marine and anadromous resources. To address some of these needs the Conservation Biology Division formed the Mathematical Biology and Systems Monitoring Program to develop, in tandem with the existing Salmon Science Programs and Salmon Recovery Planning Teams, quantitative tools for assessing population and habitat status and recovery potential and progress. One of the major projects undertaken by this program is the development of a large-scale comprehensive monitoring program to be implemented in three Columbia River sub-basins. The primary objective of this project is the development of a rule set to guide the implementation of large-scale monitoring and evaluation programs across the Columbia River basin. The project will accomplish this goal through the quantitative assessment of status and effectiveness monitoring and evaluation approaches. The component of the overall project described herein specifically addresses management and analysis of data collected from the John Day, Wenatchee, and Salmon River basins.</p>
<p>The work required under this requisition is in support of the development of habitat and population status monitoring guidelines for the Bonneville Power Administration's (BPA) Environmental, Fish and Wildlife (EFW) Program Mainstem / Systemwide Province Provincial Review Process and parallel efforts to define the status and effectiveness monitoring requirements of the 2000, 2004 and 2007 NMFS Federal Columbia River Power System Biological Opinions. While these collections of monitoring protocols and program designs have been developed by regional fisheries managers, the program as a whole has never been adequately tested in the Columbia River basin. To meet the status and effectiveness monitoring components of these needs, a proposal was initially drafted and submitted in response to the programmatic solicitations of the Mainstem/Systemwide Provincial Review. The resulting proposed status and effectiveness monitoring program seeks to implement landscape and reach scale habitat and population status monitoring in parallel with watershed-scale habitat restoration action effectiveness monitoring for anadromous salmonid populations of the Columbia River basin. This work has been funded through BPA's EFW program, with the NOAA NWFSC serving as the primary contractor for this work (BPA Project #2003-017: Integrated Status and Effectiveness Monitoring Program - ISEMP). The work required under this requisition is a subcontract to perform specific analysis and data development elements of the overall project.</p>

<p><br />2.0 SERVICES REQUIRED</p>
<p>The development of the ISEMP pilot watershed projects in the Wenatchee/Entiat, John Day and Salmon River basins is expected to be a long-term process whereby lessons learned through research and the Intensively Monitored Watershed studies will influence current and future monitoring efforts. Working closely with personnel implementing current monitoring programs in these sub-basins is critical as changes to current programs will not likely be accepted unless ISEMP can provide strong justification for the benefit of action revisions to salmonid management in the basin. Therefore, the ISEMP pilot approach is to develop a monitoring framework developed as a cohesive, basin-wide monitoring program that will be facilitated by ISEMP and accepted by the multiple monitoring entities across the Columbia River basin. The vendor will be engaged by ISEMP to perform specific technical tasks that support the overall mission of ISEMP. In particular, the vendor will be involved with developing critical data management tools to support analyses, database templates to facilitate data flow and standardization, and coordination efforts to keep ISEMP products relevant in a regional context.</p>
<p>Specific Technical Services -- Specifically this project will address the following tasks:</p>
<p>2.1 Data generation protocol. Data generation protocols are being written for data collection on the Bridge Creek Implementation project. Vendor will provide guidance to ISEMP staff to ensure protocols are documented in a format consistent with Protocol Editor. Additionally, vendor will develop standardized documentation for the PIBO habitat sampling protocol.</p>
<p>2.1.1 Protocol development. Protocol documentation includes detailed description of all attributes to be collected under each protocol and describe the format that data will be entered in the data entry templates. Documentation must follow a standardized format and be in sufficient detail to ensure consistency with the data entry templates. The vendor will provide guidance to ISEMP staff to ensure consistency and completeness of protocol documentation.</p>
<p>2.1.2 Document PIBO protocol. Habitat protocols are complex and cover a broad range of attributes. Data generators who collect habitat data tend to have strong allegiances to specific protocols and the language of those protocols. Deciphering habitat protocols and developing consistent documentation for these protocols requires prior knowledge and experience with habitat protocols. Vendor will document the PIBO habitat protocol in a format consistent with the Wenatchee habitat protocol.</p>
<p>2.2 Data entry template. Develop data management tools to support the entry of field generated data into the project data flow process. Bridge Creek Implementation project protocols must be loaded to the data entry template and validated with data collectors. Additional customization of the data entry template will ensure forms are efficient for entering data from each protocol and may require custom code to automate data entry. The vendor will customize the data entry template to ensure efficient data entry under each protocol.</p>
<p>2.2.1 Develop customized data entry templates. The&nbsp;contractor will develop customized forms and code to support efficient data entry for Bridge Creek juvenile pit tagging, spawning ground, and habitat protocols.</p>
<p>2.3 Training and support. Provide training and support to data entry technicians using the customized tools.</p>
<p>2.3.1 Train and support. Provide training and support to data entry technicians using the customized tools.</p>
<p>2.4 Data management schema. Keep up to date the development and documentation of an overarching project data management schema. The ability to manage and analyze a continuous data flow requires a data management schema that supports data entry, documentation, standardization, retrieval and analysis. Data management tool development for ISEMP has been guided by an emerging Aquatic Resource Schema (ARS); this task is to update the existing ARS to reflect modified protocols and data use procedures.</p>
<p>2.4.1 Finalize Aquatic Resources Schema. Beta versions of data entry templates for habitat, water quality, snorkel, spawning-ground, smolt trap surveys, fine-sediment and macro-invertebrates were previously developed and were tested by field data generators. The vendor will now generate final data entry templates, protocol elements, data query structures and a data dictionary for these data types as performed by ISEMP field crews in the Wenatchee, Entiat, John Day and Salmon River basins.</p>
<p>2.4.2 Export Aquatic Resources Schema data elements to enterprise level data management system. Data entry templates were developed and populated through the 2007 data entry season. The vendor will now develop Visual Basic scripts to export 2008 and future data for bulk loading to the project's data archiving and distribution system.</p>
<p>2.5 Data entry template. Develop data management tools to support the entry of field generated data into the project data flow process. Customization of the data entry template will ensure forms are efficient for entering data from each protocol and may require custom code to automate data entry. The vendor will customize the data entry template to ensure efficient data entry. The vendor will also train regional collaborators in the most efficient use and application of the updated product.</p>
<p>2.5.1 Develop customized data entry templates. The vendor will develop customized forms and code to support efficient data entry for nine data collection protocols for the ISEMP Wenatchee/Entiat fish and habitat sampling program.</p>
<p>2.5.2 Train regional data stewards in the use of data entry modules. The data entry template is available for use by projects throughout the region; however, it would be most effective if data stewards and other agency data base developers were fully trained on the use and potential extension of these tools. Therefore, the vendor will run one-on-one or small group training sessions to develop a sophisticated user base such that the tools can be used and modified as needed in as wide a manner as appropriate.</p>
<p>2.6 Data analysis documentation. Develop data management tools to support data analysis.</p>
<p>2.6.1 Develop and document analysis based data queries. The power of the ARS lines in the ability to summarize data immediately following data entry. This ability increase efficiency of data analysis and report generation. The vendor will write Ms Access queries to summarize habitat and fish data. Queries will be documented in a standardized metadata format.</p>
<p>2.6.2 Train data analysts in use of query tools. Vendor will provide a training session for data analysts on use of Ms Access for querying and summarizing data from the ARS.</p>
<p>2.7 Regional Coordination. For a monitoring program at the scale of the Columbia River Basin to be truly successful, a strategy utilizing strong yet flexible lines of communication needs to exist between project coordinators and local collaborators and should be mirrored within the data management tools developed for the program. Facilitating dialog between project managers, data collectors, data managers, and policy maker requires a coordinator with an interdisciplinary background and strong communication skills.</p>
<p>2.7.1 Coordination data managers. Communication of the ISEMP data management strategy to data managers throughout the region will support the export of lessons and ensure that feedback gets incorporated. The vendor will meet with regional data managers and data coordinating bodies to promote the ISEMP data management strategy. Additionally, the ISEMP data management tools have produced significant interest from regional data collection agencies. While the tools were developed to support ISEMP objectives, minor modifications and staff training allow for use of the tools by other agencies. Vendor staff will work with Idaho Fish and Game, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to assist these agencies integrate the ISEMP data management tools.</p>

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.

If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAIDs Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for: identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their countrys political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organizations programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.
 
   (b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show --

     (2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;
 
     (3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;
 
     (4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;

     (6) Price and any discount terms;
 
     (7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;

     (9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;
 
     (10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and
 
     (11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
 
   (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
 
   (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
 
   (e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
 
   (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.
 
     (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
 
     (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--
 
         (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
 
         (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
 
         (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
 
       (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
 
     (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
 
     (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
 
     (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
 
   (g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
 
   (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

     (2) Asian and Pacific Islander (all persons having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, or the Pacific Islands);
 
     (3) Black (all persons having origins in any of the black African racial groups not of Hispanic origin); and
 
     (4) Hispanic (all persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race).
 
   (b) If the Contractor, or a subcontractor at any tier, subcontracts a portion of the work involving any construction trade, each such subcontract in excess of $10,000 shall include this clause and the Notice containing the goals for minority and female participation stated in the solicitation for this contract.
 
   (c) If the Contractor is participating in a Hometown Plan (41 CFR 60-4) approved by the U.S. Department of Labor in a covered area, either individually or through an association, its affirmative action obligations on all work in the plan area (including goals) shall comply with the plan for those trades that have unions participating in the plan.  Contractors must be able to demonstrate participation in, and compliance with, the provisions of the plan. Each Contractor or subcontractor participating in an approved plan is also required to comply with its obligations under the Equal Opportunity clause, and to make a good faith effort to achieve each goal under the plan in each trade in which it has employees.  The overall good-faith performance by other Contractors or subcontractors toward a goal in an approved plan does not excuse any Contractor's or subcontractor's failure to make good-faith efforts to achieve the plan's goals.
 
   (d) The Contractor shall implement the affirmative action procedures in subparagraphs (g)(1) through (16) of this clause.  The goals stated in the solicitation for this contract are expressed as percentages of the total hours of employment and training of minority and female utilization that the Contractor should reasonably be able to achieve in each construction trade in which it has employees in the covered area.  If the Contractor performs construction work in a geographical area located outside of the covered area, it shall apply the goals established for the geographical area where that work is actually performed.  The Contractor is expected to make substantially uniform progress toward its goals in each craft.
 
   (e) Neither the terms and conditions of any collective bargaining agreement, nor the failure by a union with which the Contractor has a collective bargaining agreement, to refer minorities or women shall excuse the Contractor's obligations under this clause, Executive Order 11246, as amended, or the regulations thereunder.
 
   (f) In order for the nonworking training hours of apprentices and trainees to be counted in meeting the goals, apprentices and trainees must be employed by the Contractor during the training period, and the Contractor must have a commitment to employ the apprentices and trainees at the completion of their training, subject to the availability of employment opportunities.  Trainees must be trained pursuant to training programs approved by the U.S. Department of Labor.
 
   (g) The Contractor shall take affirmative action to ensure equal employment opportunity.  The evaluation of the Contractor's compliance with this clause shall be based upon its effort to achieve maximum results from its actions.  The Contractor shall document these efforts fully and implement affirmative action steps at least as extensive as the following:
 
     (1) Ensure a working environment free of harassment, intimidation, and coercion at all sites and in all facilities where the Contractor's employees are assigned to work.  The Contractor, if possible, will assign two or more women to each construction project. The Contractor shall ensure that foremen, superintendents, and other onsite supervisory personnel are aware of and carry out the Contractor's obligation to maintain such a working environment, with specific attention to minority or female individuals working at these sites or facilities.
 
     (2) Establish and maintain a current list of sources for minority and female recruitment.  Provide written notification to minority and female recruitment sources and community organizations when the Contractor or its unions have employment opportunities available, and maintain a record of the organizations' responses.
 
     (3) Establish and maintain a current file of the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of each minority and female off-the-street applicant, referrals of minorities or females from unions, recruitment sources, or community organizations, and the action taken with respect to each individual.  If an individual was sent to the union hiring hall for referral and not referred back to the Contractor by the union or, if referred back, not employed by the Contractor, this shall be documented in the file, along with whatever additional actions the Contractor may have taken.
 
     (4) Immediately notify the Deputy Assistant Secretary when the union or unions with which the Contractor has a collective bargaining agreement has not referred back to the Contractor a minority or woman sent by the Contractor, or when the Contractor has other information that the union referral process has impeded the Contractor's efforts to meet its obligations.
 
     (5) Develop on-the-job training opportunities and/or participate in training programs for the area that expressly include minorities and women, including upgrading programs and apprenticeship and trainee programs relevant to the Contractor's employment needs, especially those programs funded or approved by the Department of Labor.  The Contractor shall provide notice of these programs to the sources compiled under subparagraph (g)(2) of this clause.
 
     (6) Disseminate the Contractor's equal employment policy by--
 
       (i) Providing notice of the policy to unions and to training, recruitment, and outreach programs, and requesting their cooperation in assisting the Contractor in meeting its contract obligations;
 
       (ii) Including the policy in any policy manual and in collective bargaining agreements;
 
       (iii) Publicizing the policy in the company newspaper, annual report, etc.;
 
       (iv) Reviewing the policy with all management personnel and with all minority and female employees at least once a year; and
 
       (v) Posting the policy on bulletin boards accessible to employees at each location where construction work is performed.
 
    (7) Review, at least annually, the Contractor's equal employment policy and affirmative action obligations with all employees having responsibility for hiring, assignment, layoff, termination, or other employment decisions.  Conduct review of this policy with all on-site supervisory personnel before initiating construction work at a job site.  A written record shall be made and maintained identifying the time and place of these meetings, persons attending, subject matter discussed, and disposition of the subject matter.
 
     (8) Disseminate the Contractor's equal employment policy externally by including it in any advertising in the news media, specifically including minority and female news media.  Provide written notification to, and discuss this policy with, other Contractors and subcontractors with which the Contractor does or anticipates doing business.
 
     (9) Direct recruitment efforts, both oral and written, to minority, female, and community organizations, to schools with minority and female students, and to minority and female recruitment and training organizations serving the Contractor's recruitment area and employment needs.  Not later than 1 month before the date for acceptance of applications for apprenticeship or training by any recruitment source, send written notification to organizations such as the above, describing the openings, screening procedures, and tests to be used in the selection process.
 
     (10) Encourage present minority and female employees to recruit minority persons and women.  Where reasonable, provide after-school, summer, and vacation employment to minority and female youth both on the site and in other areas of the Contractor's workforce.
 
     (11) Validate all tests and other selection requirements where required under 41 CFR 60-3.
 
     (12) Conduct, at least annually, an inventory and evaluation at least of all minority and female personnel for promotional opportunities.  Encourage these employees to seek or to prepare for, through appropriate training, etc., opportunities for promotion.
 
     (13) Ensure that seniority practices job classifications, work assignments, and other personnel practices, do not have a discriminatory effect by continually monitoring all personnel and employment-related activities to ensure that the Contractor's obligations under this contract are being carried out.
 
     (14) Ensure that all facilities and company activities are nonsegregated except that separate or single-user rest rooms and necessary dressing or sleeping areas shall be provided to assure privacy between the sexes.
 
     (15) Maintain a record of solicitations for subcontracts for minority and female construction contractors and suppliers, including circulation of solicitations to minority and female contractor associations and other business associations.
 
     (16) Conduct a review, at least annually, of all supervisors' adherence to and performance under the Contractor's equal employment policy and affirmative action obligations.
 
   (h) The Contractor is encouraged to participate in voluntary associations that may assist in fulfilling one or more of the affirmative action obligations contained in subparagraphs (g)(1) through (16) of this clause.  The efforts of a contractor association, joint contractor-union, contractor-community, or similar group of which the contractor is a member and participant may be asserted as fulfilling one or more of its obligations under subparagraphs (g)(1) through (16) of this clause, provided the Contractor--
 
     (1) Actively participates in the group;
 
     (2) Makes every effort to ensure that the group has a positive impact on the employment of minorities and women in the industry;
 
     (3) Ensures that concrete benefits of the program are reflected in the Contractor's minority and female workforce participation;
 
     (4) Makes a good-faith effort to meet its individual goals and timetables; and
 
     (5) Can provide access to documentation that demonstrates the effectiveness of actions taken on behalf of the Contractor.  The obligation to comply is the Contractor's, and failure of such a group to fulfill an obligation shall not be a defense for the Contractor's noncompliance.
 
   (i) A single goal for minorities and a separate single goal for women shall be established.  The Contractor is required to provide equal employment opportunity and to take affirmative action for all minority groups, both male and female, and all women, both minority and nonminority.  Consequently, the Contractor may be in violation of Executive Order 11246, as amended, if a particular group is employed in a substantially disparate manner.
 
   (j) The Contractor shall not use goals or affirmative action standards to discriminate against any person because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
 
   (k) The Contractor shall not enter into any subcontract with any person or firm debarred from Government contracts under Executive Order 11246, as amended.
 
   (l) The Contractor shall carry out such sanctions and penalties for violation of this clause and of the Equal Opportunity clause, including suspension, termination, and cancellation of existing subcontracts, as may be imposed or ordered under Executive Order 11246, as amended, and its implementing regulations, by the OFCCP. Any failure to carry out these sanctions and penalties as ordered shall be a violation of this clause and Executive Order 11246, as amended.
 
   (m) The Contractor in fulfilling its obligations under this clause shall implement affirmative action procedures at least as extensive as those prescribed in paragraph (g) of this clause, so as to achieve maximum results from its efforts to ensure equal employment opportunity. If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of Executive Order 11246, as amended, the implementing regulations, or this clause, the Deputy Assistant Secretary shall take action as prescribed in 41 CFR 60-4.8.
 
   (n) The Contractor shall designate a responsible official to--
 
     (1) Monitor all employment-related activity to ensure that the Contractor's equal employment policy is being carried out;
 
     (2) Submit reports as may be required by the Government; and
 
     (3) Keep records that shall at least include for each employee the name, address, telephone number, construction trade, union affiliation (if any), employee identification number, social security number, race, sex, status (e.g., mechanic, apprentice, trainee, helper, or laborer), dates of changes in status, hours worked per week in the indicated trade, rate of pay, and locations at which the work was performed. Records shall be maintained in an easily understandable and retrievable form; however, to the degree that existing records satisfy this requirement, separate records are not required to be maintained.
 
   (o) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as a limitation upon the application of other laws that establish different standards of compliance or upon the requirements for the hiring of local or other area residents (e.g., those under the Public Works Employment Act of 1977 and the Community Development Block Grant Program).
 
 
 
52.228-5  INSURANCE - WORK ON A GOVERNMENT INSTALLATION (JAN 1997)
 
   (a) The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain during the entire performance of this contract, at least the kinds and minimum amounts of insurance required in the Schedule or elsewhere in the contract.
 
   (b) Before commencing work under this contract, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing that the required insurance has been obtained. The policies evidencing required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective--
 
     (1) For such period as the laws of the State in which this contract is to be performed prescribe; or
 
     (2) Until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the Contracting Officer, whichever period is longer.
 
   (c) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in subcontracts under this contract that require work on a Government installation and shall require subcontractors to provide and maintain the insurance required in the Schedule or elsewhere in the contract. The Contractor shall maintain a copy of all subcontractors' proofs of required insurance, and shall make copies available to the Contracting Officer upon request.
  
 
 
52.232-5  PAYMENTS UNDER FIXED-PRICE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS  (SEP 2002)
 
   (a) Payment of price. The Government shall pay the Contractor the contract price as provided in this contract.
 
   (b) Progress payments. The Government shall make progress payments monthly as the work proceeds, or at more frequent intervals as determined by the Contracting Officer, on estimates of work accomplished which meets the standards of quality established under the contract, as approved by the Contracting Officer.
 
     (1) The Contractor's request for progress payments shall include the following substantiation:
 
       (i) An itemization of the amounts requested, related to the various elements of work required by the contract covered by the payment requested.
 
       (ii) A listing of the amount included for work performed by each subcontractor under the contract.
 
       (iii) A listing of the total amount of each subcontract under the contract.
 
       (iv) A listing of the amounts previously paid to each such subcontractor under the contract.
 
       (v) Additional supporting data in a form and detail required by the Contracting Officer.
 
     (2) In the preparation of estimates, the Contracting Officer may authorize material delivered on the site and preparatory work done to be taken into consideration. Material delivered to the Contractor at locations other than the site also may be taken into consideration if--
 
       (i) Consideration is specifically authorized by this contract; and (ii) The Contractor furnishes satisfactory evidence that it has acquired title to such material and that the material will be used to perform this contract.
 
   (c) Contractor certification. Along with each request for progress payments, the Contractor shall furnish the following certification, or payment shall not be made: (However, if the Contractor elects to delete paragraph (c)(4) from the certification, the certification is still acceptable.)
 
     I hereby certify, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that--
 
     (1) The amounts requested are only for performance in accordance with the specifications, terms, and conditions of the contract;
 
     (2) All payments due to subcontractors and suppliers from previous payments received under the contract have been made, and timely payments will be made from the proceeds of the payment covered by this certification, in accordance with subcontract agreements and the requirements of chapter 39 of Title 31, United States Code;
 
     (3) This request for progress payments does not include any amounts which the prime contractor intends to withhold or retain from a subcontractor or supplier in accordance with the terms and conditions of the subcontract; and
 
     (4) This certification is not to be construed as final acceptance of a subcontractor's performance.
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 
 (Name)
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 
 (Title)
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------
 
 (Date)
 
   (d) Refund of unearned amounts.  If the Contractor, after making a certified request for progress payments, discovers that a portion or all of such request constitutes a payment for performance by the Contractor that fails to conform to the specifications, terms, and conditions of this contract (hereinafter referred to as the "unearned amount"), the Contractor shall --
 
     (1) Notify the Contracting Officer of such performance deficiency; and
 
     (2) Be obligated to pay the Government an amount (computed by the Contracting Officer in the manner provided in paragraph (j) of this clause) equal to interest on the unearned amount from the 8th day after the date of receipt of the unearned amount until--
 
       (i) The date the Contractor notifies the Contracting Officer that the performance deficiency has been corrected; or
 
       (ii) The date the Contractor reduces the amount of any subsequent certified request for progress payments by an amount equal to the unearned amount.
 
   (e) Retainage.  If the Contracting Officer finds that satisfactory progress was achieved during any period for which a progress payment is to be made, the Contracting Officer shall authorize payment to be made in full.  However, if satisfactory progress has not been made, the Contracting Officer may retain a maximum of 10 percent of the amount of the payment until satisfactory progress is achieved.  When the work is substantially complete, the Contracting Officer may retain from previously withheld funds and future progress payments that amount the Contracting Officer considers adequate for protection of the Government and shall release to the Contractor all the remaining withheld funds.  Also, on completion and acceptance of each separate building, public work, or other division of the contract, for which the price is stated separately in the contract, payment shall be made for the completed work without retention of a percentage.
 
   (f) Title, liability, and reservation of rights.  All material and work covered by progress payments made shall, at the time of payment, become the sole property of the Government, but this shall not be construed as--
 
     (1) Relieving the Contractor from the sole responsibility for all material and work upon which payments have been made or the restoration of any damaged work; or
 
     (2) Waiving the right of the Government to require the fulfillment of all of the terms of the contract.
 
   (g) Reimbursement for bond premiums.  In making these progress payments, the Government shall, upon request, reimburse the Contractor for the amount of premiums paid for performance and payment bonds (including coinsurance and reinsurance agreements, when applicable) after the Contractor has furnished evidence of full payment to the surety.  The retainage provisions in paragraph (e) of this clause shall not apply to that portion of progress payments attributable to bond premiums.
 
   (h) Final Payment.  The Government shall pay the amount due the Contractor under this contract after--
 
     (1) Completion and acceptance of all work;
 
     (2) Presentation of a properly executed voucher; and
 
     (3) Presentation of release of all claims against the Government arising by virtue of this contract, other than claims, in stated amounts, that the Contractor has specifically excepted from the operation of the release.  A release may also be required of the assignee if the Contractor's claim to amounts payable under this contract has been assigned under the Assignment of Claims Act of 1940 (31 U.S.C. 3727 and 41 U.S.C. 15).
 
   (i) Limitation because of undefinitized work.  Notwithstanding any provision of this contract, progress payments shall not exceed 80 percent on work accomplished on undefinitized contract actions. A "contract action" is any action resulting in a contract, as defined in FAR Subpart 2.1, including contract modifications for additional supplies or services, but not including contract modifications that are within the scope and under the terms of the contract, such as contract modifications issued pursuant to the Changes clause, or funding and other administrative changes.
 
   (j) Interest computation on unearned amounts. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3903(c)(1), the amount payable under subparagraph (d)(2) of this clause shall be--
 
     (1) Computed at the rate of average bond equivalent rates of 91- day Treasury bills auctioned at the most recent auction of such bills prior to the date the Contractor receives the unearned amount; and
 
     (2) Deducted from the next available payment to the Contractor.
  
 
 
52.236-7  PERMITS AND RESPONSIBILITIES  (NOV 1991)
 
   The Contractor shall, without additional expense to the Government, be responsible for obtaining any necessary licenses and permits, and for complying with any Federal, State, and municipal laws, codes, and regulations applicable to the performance of the work.  The Contractor shall also be responsible for all  damages to persons or property that occur as a result of the  Contractor's fault or negligence.  The Contractor shall also be responsible for all materials delivered and work performed until completion and acceptance of the entire work, except for any completed unit of work which may have been accepted under the contract.
 
 
 
52.232-19  AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR  (APR 1984)
 
   Funds are not presently available for performance under this contract beyond September 30, 2008.  The Government's obligation for performance of this contract beyond that date is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise for performance under this contract beyond September 30, 2008, until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for performance and until the Contractor receives notice of availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
 
 
 
52.236-9  PROTECTION OF EXISTING VEGETATION, STRUCTURES, EQUIPMENT, UTILITIES, AND IMPROVEMENTS  (APR 1984)
 
   (a) The Contractor shall preserve and protect all structures, equipment, and vegetation (such as trees, shrubs, and grass) on or adjacent to the work site, which are not to be removed and which do not unreasonably interfere with the work required under this contract.  The Contractor shall only remove trees when specifically authorized to do so, and shall avoid damaging vegetation that will remain in place.  If any limbs or branches of trees are broken during contract performance, or by the careless operation of equipment, or by workmen, the Contractor shall trim those limbs or branches with a clean cut and paint the cut with a tree-pruning compound as directed by the Contracting Officer.
 
   (b) The Contractor shall protect from damage all existing improvements and utilities (1) at or near the work site and (2) on adjacent property of a third party, the locations of which are made known to or should be known by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall repair any damage to those facilities, including those that are the property of a third party, resulting from failure to comply with the requirements of this contract or failure to exercise reasonable care in performing the work.  If the Contractor fails or refuses to repair the damage promptly, the Contracting Officer may have the necessary work performed and charge the cost to the Contractor.
 
 
 
 
52.236-11  USE AND POSSESSION PRIOR TO COMPLETION  (APR 1984)
 
   (a) The Government shall have the right to take possession of or use any completed or partially completed part of the work.  Before taking possession of or using any work, the Contracting Officer shall furnish the Contractor a list of items of work remaining to be performed or corrected on those portions of the work that the Government intends to take possession of or use.  However, failure of the Contracting Officer to list any item of work shall not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for complying with the terms of the contract.  The Government's possession or use shall not be deemed an acceptance of any work under the contract.
 
   (b) While the Government has such possession or use, the Contractor shall be relieved of the responsibility for the loss of or damage to the work resulting from the Government's possession or use, notwithstanding the terms of the clause in this contract entitled "Permits and Responsibilities." If prior possession or use by the Government delays the progress of the work or causes additional expense to the Contractor, an equitable adjustment shall be made in the contract price or the time of completion, and the contract shall be modified in writing accordingly.
 
 
52.236-12  CLEANING UP  (APR 1984)
 
   The Contractor shall at all times keep the work area, including storage areas, free from accumulations of waste materials.  Before completing the work, the Contractor shall remove from the work and premises any rubbish, tools, scaffolding, equipment, and materials that are not the property of the Government.  Upon completing the work, the Contractor shall leave the work area in a clean, neat, and orderly condition satisfactory to the Contracting Officer.
 
 
52.236-13  ACCIDENT PREVENTION  (NOV 1991)
 
   (a)  The Contractor shall provide and maintain work  environments and procedures which will (1) safeguard the public  and Government personnel, property, materials, supplies, and  equipment exposed to Contractor operations and activities; (2)  avoid interruptions of Government operations and delays in project  completion dates; and (3) control costs in the performance of this  contract.
 
   (b)  For these purposes on contracts for construction or dismantling, demolition, or removal of improvements, the  Contractor shall--
 
     (1)  Provide appropriate safety barricades, signs, and  signal lights;
 
     (2)  Comply with the standards issued by the Secretary of  Labor at 29 CFR Part 1926 and 29 CFR Part 1910; and
 
     (3)  Ensure that any additional measures the Contracting  Officer determines to be reasonably necessary for the purposes are  taken.
 
   (c)  If this contract is for construction or dismantling, demolition or removal of improvements with any Department of  Defense agency or component, the Contractor shall comply with all  pertinent provisions of the latest version of U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual, EM 385-1-1, in  effect on the date of the solicitation.
 
   (d)  Whenever the Contracting Officer becomes aware of any noncompliance with these requirements or any condition which poses  a serious or imminent danger to the health or safety of the public  or Government personnel, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor orally, with written confirmation, and request  immediate initiation of corrective action.  This notice, when  delivered to the Contractor or the Contractor's representative at  the work site, shall be deemed sufficient notice of the  noncompliance and that corrective action is required.  After  receiving the notice, the Contractor shall immediately take  corrective action.  If the Contractor fails or refuses to promptly  take corrective action, the Contracting Officer may issue an order  stopping all or part of the work until satisfactory corrective  action has been taken.  The Contractor shall not be entitled to  any equitable adjustment of the contract price or extension of the  performance schedule on any stop work order issued under this  clause.
 
   (e)  The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (e), with appropriate changes in the designation of the parties, in subcontracts.
 
 
 
52.236-19  ORGANIZATION AND DIRECTION OF THE WORK (APR 1984)
 
    (a)  When this contract is executed, the Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a chart showing the general executive and administrative organization, the personnel to be employed in connection with the work under this contract, and their respective duties.  The Contractor shall keep the data furnished current by supplementing it as additional information becomes available.
 
    (b)  Work performance under this contract shall be under the full-time resident direction of:  (1) the Contractor, if the Contractor is an individual; (2) one or more principal partners, if the Contractor is a partnership; or (3) one or more senior officers, if Contractor is a corporation, association, or similar legal entity. However, if the Contracting Officer approves, the Contracting may be represented in the direction of the work by a specific person or persons holding positions other than those identified in this paragraph.
 
 
 
52.242-14  SUSPENSION OF WORK  (APR 1984)
 
   (a) The Contracting Officer may order the Contractor, in writing, to suspend, delay, or interrupt all or any part of the work of this contract for the period of time that the Contracting Officer determines appropriate for the convenience of the Government.
 
   (b) If the performance of all or any part of the work is, for an unreasonable period of time, suspended, delayed, or interrupted (1) by an act of the Contracting Officer in the administration of this contract, or (2) by the Contracting Officer's failure to act within the time specified in this contract (or within a reasonable time if not specified), an adjustment shall be made for any increase in the cost of performance of this contract (excluding profit) necessarily caused by the unreasonable suspension, delay, or interruption, and the contract modified in writing accordingly.  However, no adjustment shall be made under this clause for any suspension, delay, or interruption to the extent that performance would have been so suspended, delayed, or interrupted by any other cause, including the fault or negligence of the Contractor, or for which an equitable adjustment is provided for or excluded under any other term or condition of this contract.
 
   (c) A claim under this clause shall not be allowed (1) for any costs incurred more than 20 days before the Contractor shall have notified the Contracting Officer in writing of the act or failure to act involved (but this requirement shall not apply as to a claim resulting from a suspension order), and (2) unless the claim, in an amount stated, is asserted in writing as soon as practicable after the termination of the suspension, delay, or interruption, but not later than the date of final payment under the contract.
 
 
 
52.242-15  STOP-WORK ORDER  (AUG 1989)
 
   (a)  The Contracting Officer may, at any time, by written order to the Contractor, require the Contractor to stop all, or any part, of the work called for by this contract for a period of 90 days after the order is delivered to the Contractor, and for any further period to which the parties may agree.  The order shall be specifically identified as a stop-work order issued under this clause.  Upon receipt of the order, the Contractor shall immediately comply with its terms and take all reasonable steps to minimize the incurrence of costs allocable to the work covered by the order during the period of work stoppage.  Within a period of 90 days after a stop-work order is delivered to the Contractor, or within any extension of that period to which the parties shall have agreed, the Contracting Officer shall either -
 
     (1)  Cancel the stop-work order; or
 
     (2)  Terminate the work covered by the order as provided in the Default, or the Termination for Convenience of the Government, clause of this contract.
 
   (b)  If a stop-work order issued under this clause is canceled or the period of the order or any extension thereof expires, the Contractor shall resume work.  The Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule or contract price, or both, and the contract shall be modified, in writing, accordingly, if-
 
     (1)  The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required for, or in the Contractor's cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of this contract; and
 
     (2)  The Contractor asserts its right to the adjustment within 30 days after the end of the period of work stoppage; provided, that, if the Contracting Officer decides the facts justify the action, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted at any time before final payment under this contract.
 
   (c)  If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement.
 
   (d)  If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order.
 
 
 
52.246-12  INSPECTION OF CONSTRUCTION (AUG 1996)

   (b)  The Contractor shall maintain an adequate inspection system and perform such inspections as will ensure that the work performed under the contract conforms to contract requirements.  The Contractor shall maintain complete inspection records and make them available to the Government.  All work shall be conducted under the general direction of the Contracting Officer and is subject to Government inspection and test at all places and at all reasonable times before acceptance to ensure strict compliance with the terms of the contract.
 
   (c)  Government inspections and tests are for the sole benefit of the Government and do not -
 
     (1)  Relieve the Contractor of responsibility for providing adequate quality control measures;
 
     (2)  Relieve the Contractor of responsibility for damage to or loss of the material before acceptance;
 
     (3)  Constitute or imply acceptance; or
 
     (4)  Affect the continuing rights of the Government after acceptance of the completed work under paragraph (i) below.
 
   (d)  The presence or absence of a Government inspector does not relieve the Contractor from any contract requirement, nor is the inspector authorized to change any term or condition of the specification without the Contracting Officer's written authorization.
 
   (e)  The Contractor shall promptly furnish, at no increase in contract price, all facilities, labor, and material reasonably needed for performing such safe and convenient inspections and tests as may be required by the Contracting Officer.  The Government may charge to the Contractor any additional cost of inspection or test when work is not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, or when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.  The Government shall perform all inspections and tests in a manner that will not unnecessarily delay the work.  Special, full size, and performance tests shall be performed as described in the contract.
 
   (f)  The Contractor shall, without charge, replace or correct work found by the Government not to conform to contract requirements, unless in the public interest the Government consents to accept the work with an appropriate adjustment in contract price.  The Contractor shall promptly segregate and remove rejected material from the premises.
 
   (g)  If the Contractor does not promptly replace or correct rejected work, the Government may (1)  by contract or otherwise, replace or correct the work and charge the cost to the Contractor or (2)  terminate for default the Contractor's right to proceed.
 
   (h)  If, before acceptance of the entire work, the Government decides to examine already completed work by removing it or tearing it out, the Contractor, on request, shall promptly furnish all necessary facilities, labor, and material.  If the work is found to be defective or nonconforming in any material respect due to the fault of the Contractor or its subcontractors, the Contractor shall defray the expenses of the examination and of satisfactory reconstruction.  However, if the work is found to meet contract requirements, the Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment for the additional services involved in the examination and reconstruction, including, if completion of the work was thereby delayed, an extension of time.
 
   (i)  Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government shall accept, as promptly as practicable after completion and inspection, all work required by the contract or that portion of the work the Contracting Officer determines can be accepted separately.  Acceptance shall be final and conclusive except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or the Government's rights under any warranty or guarantee.
 
 
 
52.246-21  WARRANTY OF CONSTRUCTION  (MAR 1994)
 
   (a) In addition to any other warranties in this contract, the Contractor warrants, except as provided in paragraph (i) of this clause, that work performed under this contract conforms to the contract requirements and is free of any defect in equipment, material, or design furnished, or workmanship performed by the Contractor or any subcontractor or supplier at any tier.
 
   (b) This warranty shall continue for a period of 1 year from the date of final acceptance of the work. If the Government takes possession of any part of the work before final acceptance, this warranty shall continue for a period of 1 year from the date the Government takes possession.
 
   (c) The Contractor shall remedy at the Contractor's expense any failure to conform, or any defect. In addition, the Contractor shall remedy at the Contractor's expense any damage to Government-owned or controlled real or personal property, when that damage is the result of--

     (2) Any defect of equipment, material, workmanship, or design furnished.
 
   (d) The Contractor shall restore any work damaged in fulfilling the terms and conditions of this clause. The Contractor's warranty with respect to work repaired or replaced will run for 1 year from the date of repair or replacement.

   (f) If the Contractor fails to remedy any failure, defect, or damage within a reasonable time after receipt of notice, the Government shall have the right to replace, repair, or otherwise remedy the failure, defect, or damage at the Contractor's expense.
 
   (g) With respect to all warranties, express or implied, from subcontractors, manufacturers, or suppliers for work performed and materials furnished under this contract, the Contractor shall--
 
     (1) Obtain all warranties that would be given in normal commercial practice;
 
     (2) Require all warranties to be executed, in writing, for the benefit of the Government, if directed by the Contracting Officer; and
 
     (3) Enforce all warranties for the benefit of the Government, if directed by the Contracting Officer.
 
   (h) In the event the Contractor's warranty under paragraph (b) of this clause has expired, the Government may bring suit at its expense to enforce a subcontractor's, manufacturer's, or supplier's warranty.
 
   (i) Unless a defect is caused by the negligence of the Contractor or subcontractor or supplier at any tier, the Contractor shall not be liable for the repair of any defects of material or design furnished by the Government nor for the repair of any damage that results from any defect in Government-furnished material or design.
 
   (j) This warranty shall not limit the Government's rights under the Inspection and Acceptance clause of this contract with respect to latent defects, gross mistakes, or fraud.

 
52.246-17  WARRANTY OF SUPPLIES OF A NONCOMPLEX NATURE (JUNE 2003)
 
   (a) Definitions. As used in this clause--
 
     Acceptance means the act of an authorized representative of the Government by which the Government assumes for itself, or as an agent of another, ownership of existing supplies, or approves specific services as partial or complete performance of the contract.
 
     Supplies means the end items furnished by the Contractor and related services required under this contract. The word does not include ``data.''
 
   (b) Contractor's obligations.  (1) Notwithstanding inspection and acceptance by the Government of supplies furnished under this contract, or any condition of this contract concerning the conclusiveness thereof, the Contractor warrants that for --
 
       (i) All supplies furnished under this contract will be free from defects in material or workmanship and will conform with all requirements of this contract; and
 
       (ii) The preservation, packaging, packing, and marking, and the preparation for, and method of, shipment of such supplies will conform with the requirements of this contract.
 
     (2) When return, correction, or replacement is required, transportation charges and responsibility for the supplies while in transit shall be borne by the Contractor.  However, the Contractor's liability for the transportation charges shall not exceed an amount equal to the cost of transportation by the usual commercial method of shipment between the place of delivery specified in this contract and the Contractor's plant, and return.
 
     (3) Any supplies or parts thereof, corrected or furnished in replacement under this clause, shall also be subject to the terms of this clause to the same extent as supplies initially delivered.  The warranty, with respect to supplies or parts thereof, shall be equal in duration to that in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause and shall run from the date of delivery of the corrected or replaced supplies.
 
     (4) All implied warranties of merchantability and "fitness for a particular purpose" are excluded from any obligation contained in this contract.
 
   (c) Remedies available to the Government.  (1) The Contracting Officer shall give written notice to the Contractor of any breach of warranties in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause within .
 
     (2) Within a reasonable time after the notice, the Contracting Officer may either--
 
       (i) Require, by written notice, the prompt correction or replacement of any supplies or parts thereof (including preservation, packaging, packing, and marking) that do not conform with the requirements of this contract within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this clause; or
 
       (ii) Retain such supplies and reduce the contract price by an amount equitable under the circumstances.
 
     (3)(i) If the contract provides for inspection of supplies by sampling procedures, conformance of supplies or components subject to warranty action shall be determined by the applicable sampling procedures in the contract.  The Contracting Officer--
 
         (A) May, for sampling purposes, group any supplies delivered under this contract;
 
         (B) Shall require the size of the sample to be that required by sampling procedures specified in the contract for the quantity of supplies on which warranty action is proposed;
 
         (C) May project warranty sampling results over supplies in the same shipment or other supplies contained in other shipments even though all of such supplies are not present at the point of reinspection; provided, that the supplies remaining are reasonably representative of the quantity on which warranty action is proposed; and
 
         (D) Need not use the same lot size as on original inspection or reconstitute the original inspection lots.
 
       (ii) Within a reasonable time after notice of any breach of the warranties specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the Contracting Officer may exercise one or more of the following options:
 
         (A) Require an equitable adjustment in the contract price for any group of supplies.
 
         (B) Screen the supplies grouped for warranty action under this clause at the Contractor's expense and return all nonconforming supplies to the Contractor for correction or replacement.
 
         (C) Require the Contractor to screen the supplies at locations designated by the Government within the contiguous United States and to correct or replace all nonconforming supplies.
 
         (D) Return the supplies grouped for warranty action under this clause to the Contractor (irrespective of the f.o.b. point or the point of acceptance) for screening and correction or replacement.
 
     (4) (i) The Contracting Officer may, by contract or otherwise, correct or replace the nonconforming supplies with similar supplies from another source and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned to the Government thereby if the Contractor--
 
         (A) Fails to make redelivery of the corrected or replaced supplies within the time established for their return; or
 
         (B) Fails either to accept return of the nonconforming supplies or fails to make progress after their return to correct or replace them so as to endanger performance of the delivery schedule, and in either of these circumstances does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure.
 
       (ii) Instead of correction or replacement by the Government, the Contracting Officer may require an equitable adjustment of the contract price.  In addition, if the Contractor fails to furnish timely disposition instructions, the Contracting Officer may dispose of the nonconforming supplies for the Contractor's account in a reasonable manner.  The Government is entitled to reimbursement from the Contractor, or from the proceeds of such disposal, for the reasonable expenses of the care and disposition of the nonconforming supplies, as well as for excess costs incurred or to be incurred.
 
     (5) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the Government by any other clause of this contract.
 
 
 
52.249-10  DEFAULT (FIXED-PRICE CONSTRUCTION)  (APR 1984)
 
   (a) If the Contractor refuses or fails to prosecute the work or any separable part, with the diligence that will insure its completion within the time specified in this contract including any extension, or fails to complete the work within this time, the Government may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right to proceed with the work (or the separable part of the work) that has been delayed. In this event, the Government may take over the work and complete it by contract or otherwise, and may take possession of and use any materials, appliances, and plant on the work site necessary for completing the work. The Contractor and its sureties shall be liable for any damage to the Government resulting from the Contractor's refusal or failure to complete the work within the specified time, whether or not the Contractor's right to proceed with the work is terminated. This liability includes any increased costs incurred by the Government in completing the work.
 
   (b) The Contractor's right to proceed shall not be terminated nor the Contractor charged with damages under this clause, if--
 
     (1) The delay in completing the work arises from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.  Examples of such causes include--
 
       (i) Acts of God or of the public enemy,
 
       (ii) Acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity,
 
       (iii) Acts of another Contractor in the performance of a contract with the Government,
 
       (iv) Fires,
 
       (v) Floods,
 
       (vi) Epidemics,
 
       (vii) Quarantine restrictions,
 
       (viii) Strikes,
 
       (ix) Freight embargoes,
 
       (x) Unusually severe weather, or
 
       (xi) Delays of subcontractors or suppliers at any tier arising from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of both the Contractor and the subcontractors or suppliers; and
 
     (2) The Contractor, within 10 days from the beginning of any delay (unless extended by the Contracting Officer), notifies the Contracting Officer in writing of the causes of delay. The Contracting Officer shall ascertain the facts and the extent of delay. If, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, the findings of fact warrant such action, the time for completing the work shall be extended. The findings of the Contracting Officer shall be final and conclusive on the parties, but subject to appeal under the Disputes clause.
 
   (c) If, after termination of the Contractor's right to proceed, it is determined that the Contractor was not in default, or that the delay was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties will be the same as if the termination had been issued for the convenience of the Government.
 
   (d) The rights and remedies of the Government in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.

Questions from Contractors

1.  Question:  Is it possible to get a list of addresses for the 64 additional units?  Without the addresses, we cannot accurately plot the locations and distances to determine pricing.

2.  It now states that we can submit our proposal via email to your email account.  Question:  Is the requirement for original and one copy no longer necessary?  Answer:  If you send hardcopies of your proposal, please ensure that an original and one copy are received.  

3.  Question:  What is the fax or email address that the Performance Evaluations should be sent to?  Answer:  Please forward all past performance evaluations via email to 
Linda J. Richardson at Linda.S.Jackson1@dhs.gov.  All past performance evaluations must be received by 6/19/2008.  Late evaluations will not be accepted.  Offerors who submit no past performance evaluations will be rated as neutral.

4.  In regards to the MDC Kansas solicitation, I am in the process of registering my company as a foreign limited liability company in Kansas.  We have been in talks with the Kansas Secretary of State about receiving a "Letter of Good Standing", which will allow us to do business in Kansas.  Unfortunately, I will not have this documentation by Friday to submit with our bid package.  

(a)  Question:  With this in mind, can I submit a proposal in response to Solicitation HSFEHQ-08-R-0021 as a certified Kansas Company with the intention of being compliant with the state of Kansas before the potential award date?  
Answer:    Your company must reside in or primarily do business in Kansas.  FAR 52.226-3 contains the test for "residing in" or "primarily doing business in" a particular location.  
 
6.  Question:  In reviewing the Past Performance Questionnaires posted on FBO this morning, it appears that these phone interviews are to be conducted by a Government Employee after the bid is submitted, is this correct?  Answer:  Please provide all points of contact for each evaluation you submit.

<CONTACT>Jodi B. Condes, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-366-6991, Email jodi.condes@dot.gov
<DESC>This BAA is being amended to reflect changes to the cost share/matching requirments as a result of Public Law 110-244, which was signed by the President on June 6, 2008.  PL 110-244 is a  technical corrections bill that, among other things, changes the match requirement for cooperative agreements under SAFETEA-LU Title V, which includes the FHWAs Exploratory Advanced Research Program.  

Accordingly, proposals under this BAA that include between 20 percent non-federal matching funds and 50 percent matching, as well as those with over 50 percent non-federal matching funds, may be awarded as cooperative agreements.  Please note the attached BAA and Proposer Information Package (PIP) have been updated and are attached to this amendment. The updates are highlight in red text for ease of reference.

Note that there is no change to the evaluation criteria including partnership and cost realism.  Other elements being similar, proposals with a greater amount of partnership funding will receive higher evaluations.

There is no change to the schedule for submission of proposals; the closing date remains 4:00 pm, EST, on June 26, 2008.

<DESC>There are two purposes for this amendment.
The first purpose is to answer questions posed by vendors.  The questions and answers are below.  Due to the need to make award in a timely fashion, no more questions can be answered.  Accordingly, quotations should be made based on the original solicitation and this amendment.   

The second purpose is to extend the quotation due date from 5:00 P.M. (EST) on July 12, 2005, to 5:00 P.M. (EST) on July 13, 2005. 

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q:  Regarding Line items 1-4, can you give me an idea on quantity you might be needing to print? 

A:  For line items 1  4, we are seeking a per print cost, per size, described in the line items.  Most items are single print items, not a mass of one (1) jpeg (e.g., 50 copies of one shot).  There may be an occasional head count for group shots.  The quantity will vary.   

Q:  Will the montage get printed as well or will we be supplying back a digital file for you?  

A:  The montage will get printed.  

Q:  The award is only for a two month period.  How is the one year option period awarded?  

A:  It will be awarded pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  

Q:  What are the projected quantities for the 2 month period and the 1 year period? 

A:  The quantities will vary for those periods.  There are no provided projections in terms of quantity.     

Q:  Can I give quantity ranges for my pricing (example: 1-25 prints $X, 26-50 prints $X)?

A:  Do not use quantity ranges for pricing.  

Q:  Can I attach a sample page of previous work with our bid?

A:  Your quotation should supply the information requested.  

Q:  In each of the requested size categories, would the requirement be for one copy of each image or a quantity of prints from each file?

A:   These are one on one grip and grin type pictures with an occasional group.

Q:  What would be the required turn around for the requested work?

A: The desired turn around time would be one week. 

Q:  Is there an estimate of the total number of requested prints (orders) for each period of performance (base period, which ends September 30, 2005 and the option period, which runs from October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006)? 

A: The projected quantities will vary, and no estimate is being provided here.  

Q:  The solicitation mentions the possibility of requesting prints from film based images.  Would there be an estimate of the approximate percentages of the total work which this might include?

A:  An estimated 3 %.

Q:  For the 8X10 montage, will a layout for the images be provided or would we be responsible for the creative design of the page?

A:  Either way.  The person doing the printing will have the opportunity to be creative.  However, DHS can also handle the layout, if that is preferred.  

Q:  It there a specification for the required print frames other than they be wired for hanging? 

A:   A simple black wooden frame.

Q:  Do the required print frames require the additional protection of either glass or plexiglass?

A: No   A protective spray has been used and would be required, as mentioned in Line Item 3 of the SOW.

Q:  When do you expect the contract to be awarded?

A:  Award will be made as soon as a vendor is selected.  Since this amendment will be the final one (and all proposals will now be due by 5:00 Eastern Time, July 13 with no further questions being allowed), award will probably be made no later than July 22.  

Q:  You mentioned the ability that you have to request resubmissions/alterations to a submitted quote. Is it preferable for the quotes to be submitted early so that there is time to resubmit prior to the deadline, or would you allow the resubmission to occur after the deadline should the need arise?

A:  This question refers to the solicitations inclusion of FAR 52.215.5, Facsimile Proposals, where a portion of the facsimile proposal received by the contracting office is unreadable to the degree that conformance to the essential requirements of the solicitation cannot be ascertained from the document.  Thus, other than facsimile proposals fitting this description, the only resubmissions that will be allowed will be for vendors who submitted price quotations BEFORE this Amendment posted.  Such vendors will each have the ability to review the posted Amendment and submit a new quotation, based on the information provided in this Amendment.  If such vendor does not submit another quotation, its original quotation will be considered.

<DESC>Questions and AnswersSince this is a re-issuance of RFQ VA-101-08-RQ-0122 the government will not be responding to questions for this solicitation.  However the government will provide question and answers to the last solicitation in effort to expedite the procurement process.Questions and Answers in reference to the Hearing Transcription Court Reporting Services solicitation  Question #1: Unable to register at http://www.vets100.cudenver.edu/ because of an apparent error that exists at this web site address.  Answer: Try using the email address below to get help with registration error issue or to get to a Customer Service Representative.  verify@VETS100.com  Question #2: Company performs this type of work but never for the government and never in a "traveling" situation. Is actual travel to different sites to record the proceedings a required component for the transcription service provider?  Answer: There is no travel involved for the vendor.  The Board accomplishes the recording of hearing proceedings.  Question #3: As a transcription service for 14 years we have many client referrals but none that required exactly what seems to be needed here.  In your opinion, would that automatically disqualify us from being awarded a portion of this RFQ?  Answer: A primary need of the Board is to receive quality transcripts from media devices that are provided.  Having 14 years of transcription service justifies the ability to perform the tasks. The Statement of Work clearly identifies all requirements.  Question #4: Is there a template (or example) available that includes all the required components for a response to the RFQ?  Answer: Templates/examples will be provided via email request or to the awardee(s) at time of award.  Question #5: Does the contracting company record the hearings for transcription?  Answer:  The contracting company does not record the hearings.  A media device is provided, via cassette tape or wav file (digital recording).  The company will have to access the BVA VPN Server to download the digital recordings.  Instructions on gaining access to the server will be provided once award is granted.

<DESC><p>QUESTION</p>
<p>Various PDP assembly drawings call for "Class L" connectors (input and output) per MIL-C-22992. MIL-C-22992 includes a QPL. Please confirm that only vendors approved and on the QPL will be acceptable for this procurement. Several vendors manufacture non-QPL versions of these connectors.</p>
<p>ANSWER&nbsp;</p>
<p>The power distribution panels were design to meet requirements of the MIL-DTL-29183C (it is referenced on the drawings).<br />The L-type connectors from the QPL list are preferred but not mandated. The proposed connectors shall meet all requirements of MIL-C-22992 and be form, fit, and function equivalent to MS connectors specified on the drawings. Contractor shall submit ECP in order to receive government approval for new proposed connectors prior to start of fabrication of FA units. In no way it shall be misconstrued, that the government will accept commercial connectors which do not meet requirements of MIL-C-22992.</p>

<DESC>A recent research report from New Zealand showed data that stressed the need for greater isomeric purity in the larger compound. As a result of this amendment the specifications have been changed (attached).

The purpose of this amendment is to change the submission requirements to include a sample lure which will be chemically evaluated (see section M).  The entire scope of work has been updated with all amendments (0001 through 0003) and is attached for reference.  As a result of this amendment the solicitation due date has been extended.

The purpose of this amendment is to amend the statement of work section C Specifications to allow the use of PVC matrix type dispenser in lieu of a synthetic rubber septum.  It also amends section M Evaluation Factors for Award to state that offerors shall submit a lure (packaged as specified in section D2 Special Packaging and Marking) and a separate 50mg sample of neat (i.e., pure and undiluted) acetate.  If the LBAM pheromone is premixed send a 50mg sample of that pheromone.

A full copy of the updated scope of work is available (sol 0071 Amendment 0004.doc)

<DESC>Amendment 2

The purpose of Amendment 2 is to provide answers to the following questions contractors submitted prior to June 9, 2008 and provide the presentation and attendance list from the June 4, 2008 site visit in Gallatin, Tennessee.

1.   Question:  Is there a NAICS code size standard for this Solicitation?  We did not see one in the below synopsis but did see one listed in the Form 1449 as $13M.  We had a good revenue year last year that probably will put us over the $13M threshold but we are still way under our Small Business Size $$ standard.  Pls. let me know as we would be perfect for this solicitation.  Answer:  The NAICS code size standard is what you referenced on the 1449 which is $13 million.  

2.  Question:  Where is the staging area going to be for the mobile homes?  Answer:  I believe what you are referring to as the staging area is the location of the mobile homes.  There is a total of thirty-seven (37) mobile homes located within Macon, Trousdale and Sumner counties, all located in the state of Tennessee.

Ricky Corum introduced himself then asked everyone in attendance to introduce themselves. Ricky started the meeting by giving a background description of the Program Management Office Individual Assistance Technical Assistance Contract, Acquisition Management and Direct Housing Operations (DHOPS) primary functions. The intent was to help the new Maintenance and Deactivation contractors understand the relationship of the three different branches of FEMA. 

A power point presentation was passed out and Ricky explained some of the requirements of the Maintenance and Deactivation contract for temporary housing units. He discussed the Performance Work Statement outlining FEMA Responsibilities, Contractor Responsibilities, Maintenance of the units, Deactivations of the units, Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan, Invoicing, Security Badges, COTR responsibilities, task order procedures, Price CLINS and un-priced CLINS. The contactor was also provided contact information for the Contracting Specialist, and MDC Senior COTR. 

The Phase-In period was described and it was explained that there would be a three party inspection of the units with the IA-TAC II contractor, MDC Contractor and a FEMA representative as part of the transition process. The Weekly Monthly Maintenance Reports were discussed. 

The call center requirements were discussed and it was explained that the contractor is required to have an 800 call center number within 48 hours of the award. 

Preventive/Routine Maintenance was explained. The contractor was told to figure on replacing batteries in smoke/gas detectors for safety reasons. 

FEMA policy is when no one is home is for the contractor to make three attempts to call the occupant at different times on three different days to set up an appointment 48 hrs prior to going to the unit. If you can not reach the occupant after the third attempt notify DHOPS and they will look for alternate phone numbers for the occupant and do a drive by inspection to check the status of the unit and notify you of there findings as soon as possible. 


It was explained if the applicant has put holes in the wall you should bring this to the attention of Disaster Housing with an estimated price to repair and they will send the applicant a letter asking them to pay for the repairs. However if it is a Safety, Sanitary or Security item this will be handle differently if someone has broken out a window on busted the front door this will need to be taken care of right away and all the information provide to DHOPS so they can follow up with the occupant about the damages.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) plans to procure on a sole source basis, Human CNV370-Duo DNA Analysis BeadChip and Reagents with Illumina, Inc; 9885 Towne Center Drive; San Diego, California 92121.

The supplies are herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.106-(b) (1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

The purpose of this requirement is for the NCI laboratory to undertake a micoarray genotyping project to identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) predisposing for sporadic papillary serious ovarian cancer. The Illumina Human CNV370-Duo platform provides the most complete, accurate, and detailed analysis of the specimens. The Human CNV370-Duo DNA Analysis BeadChip and Reagents contains over 370,000 informative SNP markers spanning the human genome.  This set design uses polymorphic markers derived from Phase I and II of the HapMap project/study and additional content covering copy variant regions of the genome.

The manufacturing technology, array design, and detection methods of the Illumina arrays are entirely owned by Illumina Inc. Furthermore, it is not known to the NCI that there are any licensed systems, instruments, or arrays offered by third party providers that are able to use any component of the Illumina BeadChip genotyping system. In addition, in order to satisfy the requirements of the HapMap project/study and ensure the data generated can be incorporated into an extensive pre-existing database derived using the Human CNV370-Duo DNA Analysis BeadChip and Reagents platform, the proposed project must adhere to the conditions, reagents, and array platform previously used. Otherwise, subsequent data analysis and clinical validation will be compromised. Changing variables at this time will de detrimental to the current HapMap project/study. 

This is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can meet this requirement. One (1) original and one (1) copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. ET on June 26, 2008. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to Malinda Holdcraft: holdcram@exchange.nih.gov. It is the vendors responsibility to ensure questions have been received. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted. In order to receive an award, contractor must have valid, updated registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). Please reference NCI-80092-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>  1. This notice is the third of three Notices made pursuant to FAR 5.205(b) indicating The Department of Homeland Security's intent to sponsor a new Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).  Specifically, DHS intends to sponsor a system engineering/systems development (SED) FFRDC to be known as the Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute (SEDI).  The typical, but not exclusive, role of a SEDI FFRDC is to help DHS identify and implement technical systems engineering and acquisitions best practices in major acquisition programs that will ensure fair, efficient, effective, and open competition throughout the acquisition lifecycle. 
 
2. By The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (PL 107-296, as amended), Section 305, Congress authorized DHS to establish one or more FFRDCs to assist DHS in formulating and addressing important homeland security issues, particularly those where scientific, technical and analytical expertise is involved, such as systems engineering/systems development. 

 3. While the DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) will be the primary sponsor of the SEDI FFRDC, any DHS Component choosing to use the SEDI FFRDCs services would be viewed as the sponsor for its respective tasks.  In general, DHS S&T will provide technical quality, business, financial and contractual oversight. The SEDI FFRDC shall conduct its business in a manner befitting its special relationship with the Government; i.e., to operate with objectivity and be free from conflicts-of-interest, to fully disclose its affairs to its sponsors, and to serve the unique needs of its sponsors, while holding its full confidence and trust. Any subsidiary relationship the SEDI FFRDC may have with a parent organization or consortia of organizations must demonstrate and maintain strict safeguards from conflicts of interest with such parent organizations. Work performed by the SEDI FFRDC for non-DHS customers may be performed only with the explicit permission of DHS S&T. 

 4. The SEDI FFRDC Contractor shall provide all required and necessary space, equipment, support and technical personnel (except that as may be Government furnished) to establish, set up and manage the SEDI FFRDC. Performance of the SEDI FFRDC management function required under the contract will take place in the Washington DC metropolitan areas, with the exception of assignees to field operations. 

 5. The work to be performed under the contract will involve access to, handling of and generation of classified information up to and including Top Secret and sensitive compartmented information (SCI). 

 6. The Contractor shall provide a wide range of functions, including:    
&#61607;	Provide technical expertise and systems engineering support to the Department in the acquisition of major homeland security systems to effectively and efficiently achieve cost, schedule and performance goals. This effort includes developing technical contract requirements and evaluating potential performers for major DHS acquisition programs; 
&#61607;	Provide technical advice to DHS program offices in the management and quality control/assurance of integration and sub-system contracts in support of major acquisition programs to optimize trade-offs in meeting program cost, schedule and performance goals; 
&#61607;	Develop and deploy analytical tools and techniques to evaluate sub-system alternatives and life-cycle costs that have broad application across the Department;
&#61607;	Develop guidance for the Department to effectively manage efficient integrated business/financial, planning and budgeting systems; 
&#61607;	Provide unique development test and evaluation activities, particular in areas of interoperability, information technology and information management systems; particularly in areas where competitive sourcing of these activities would not be efficient or effective;
&#61607;	Develop recommendations on best practices for software and technical data development processes at the system and sub-system levels and promote system of systems interoperability, including independent verification and validation efforts; 
&#61607;	Support the development of processes and systems to acquire, manage, and use  of program technical data (e.g., configuration management, logistic cycle analysis, etc.) in and across the major DHS programs; 
&#61607;	Support acquisition program risk management activities by developing analytic tools that can be applied consistently across Department programs; 
&#61607;	Support interface management development activities related to sub-system integration as well as system of systems integration that contribute to a larger DHS system of system enterprise; 
&#61607;	Provide independent evaluation and audit support in the development phase of major programs for sub-systems and their integration, including: performance metrics, evaluation criteria, assessment of integration contractor and sub-contractor performance, product quality assurance/control, development verification and validation studies at the sub-system levels; 
&#61607;	Provide advice for standards for Homeland Security systems development and engineering best practices for an integrated DHS approach to systems acquisition; 
&#61607;	Understand key homeland security organizations and their specific role, and major acquisition requirements.
 
The intent of the SEDI FFRDC is to provide long-term, independent and objective advice to the government, using technical talent that is generally not available inside the government.  The SEDI FFRDC will provide support to all major DHS components in an integrative and cross-cutting manner, with any other DHS FFRDCs, so that over time DHSs FFRDCs  will provide greater synergy, best practices, and lessons learned in relevant areas.  The SEDI FFRDC will operate in a manner that is free of real and perceived conflicts of interest through the rigorous application of corporate firewalls and personnel conflict of interest and non-disclosure agreements approved by the DHS. Corporate entities that operate one of DHS's FFRDCs shall not be eligible to operate one of the other DHS FFRDCs, so that the FFRDCs may be used to provide independent and objective cross validation as necessary.

 7. The SEDI FFRDC contract has an anticipated award date in December 2008.  It is anticipated that the SEDI FFRDC will require startup funds to be provided from G&A; and no annual "core" funding because it is envisioned to subsist on task orders from the major DHS acquisition programs anticipated not to exceed 300 Staff-years of technical effort (STE) annually. A surcharge of up to 5% may be charged against task orders for DHS cross cutting research and development. The complete solicitation package will be available electronically at www.FBO.gov. No paper copies of the solicitation will be provided. 

8.  DHS requests comments on this Notice of Intent to Sponsor a Federally Funded Research and Development Center for System Engineering Development.  Any comments should be submitted electronically to sedi-ffrdc@hq.dhs.gov.  Comments must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on July 4, 2008.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Wayne State University (WSU), 656 West Kirby, 4001 Faculty Administration Building, Detroit, MI 48202-3622. WSU is the only known qualified source to perform this effort. US Army Tank-Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) desires to procure Low Temperature Research services in the study of diesel engine performance under extreme cold ambient conditions. The detailed efforts required include but are not limited to (1) simultaneous chemiluminescence and visible range imaging to study diesel fuel spray behavior during the cold starting events; (2) investigation of potential cold start engine control options toward addressing the various transient combustion regimes that occur during start-up events; (3) examinination of the solid/fluid interaction between the piston assembly and associated lubricating oil film at low temperature operating conditions; and (4) study of the impact of low temperature con  ditions on the cold starting of a high power density military diesel engine. Market research indicated that WSU is uniquely capable and facilitized to meet TARDEC's research requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. Projected period of performance is eighteen (18) months. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment 0001 is to affect the following against Solicitation number W15P7T-08-R-M207:<BR><BR>The following three paragraphs are an update to the information disseminated in respect to the synopsis posted on 05 May 2008 in regards to unclassified data and classified data pertaining to this procurement: <BR><BR>The exporting of defense articles, services and technical data to foreign persons or organizations is controlled by the International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. Parts 120-130.  The US Munitions List, 22 C.F.R. Part 121, lists those articles, services and related technical data which have been designated as defense articles and defense services pursuant to  38 and 47(7) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778 and 2794(7)) and, accordingly, come within the regulatory provisions of the ITAR.  The system specifications contained in this solicitation are both unclassified and classified.  Both come within the purview of the U.S. Munitions List and, accordingly, require an export license for their transfer to foreign persons or organizations.      <BR><BR>An exemption from this export license requirement exists at 22 C.F.R. 125.4(c) for defense services and related unclassified technical data to nationals of NATO and certain other countries for purposes of responding to a written request from the Department of Defense for a quote or bid proposal.  The PM 3rd Gen FLIR has applied for certification of this exemption from the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Defense Exports and Cooperation Headquarters DOA.  This certification has been returned with out action.  Accordingly, the CECOM LCMC Acquisition center is unable to transfer the unclassified system specifications to foreign persons or organizations wishing to respond to the subject solicitation.  Accordingly, an eligible foreign company interested in pursuing unclassified data and classified data pertaining to this procurement shall follow Title 22, Part 125, of the Code of Federal Regulations, Licenses for the Export of Technical Data.<BR><BR>U.S. policy is to avoid creating false impressions of its readiness to make available classified military materiel, technology, or information.  Therefore, initial discussions with foreign governments and international organizations concerning programs that might involve the eventual disclosure of classified military information may be conducted only if it is explicitly understood and acknowledged that no U.S. commitment to furnish such classified information or material is intended or implied until disclosure has been approved. Accordingly, proposals to foreign governments and international organizations that result from either U.S. or combined initial planning and that may lead to the eventual disclosure of classified military materiel, technology, or information must be authorized either by designated disclosure officials in the departments and agencies originating the information or by the National Disclosure Policy Committee (NDPC)  <BR><BR>The posting date of the Solicitation shall be on or about 13 June 2008. <BR>

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis.  The response date is corrected to read 6/30/2008.
1. Is this a follow on?No.  This is a new effort and there is no previous contract action.
2. Is this work going to be classified at all?No.
3. What Geospatial Information System (GIS) application or solution is USGS currently using?   The solicitation will detail the information when released.  Please check this site for release on or after 30 June 2008.
4. Does the USGS want a custom GIS from the ground up? Or would it be customization of a COTS system?This will be a customized effort and the specifics will be detailed in the solicitation. 
5. Please provide us with the statement of work for the current contract in place?There is no current contract. 6. Is there an incumbent contractor currently providing these services? If yes, who is it? No, there is no incumbent.
7. The Presolicitation Notice indicates that the RFP will be issued on or after June 30, 2008, and that the response date is July 15, 2008. How much time does the Government plan to give bidders to respond to the RFP?The end date of the presolicitation notice has been corrected to read June 30, 2008.  The solicitation will state how long bidders have to respond.
8. Is a bidders conference planned for this effort?No.
9. Does the Government plan to issue a draft RFP?No.
10. The notice states that this is a 100% small business set-aside, per FAR Part 19.5. Will there be any limitations on subcontracting for this effort? Per the SBA, a small business must perform at least 51% of the work awarded under a set-aside contract. Is that what is intended for this effort? FAR 52.219-14(b)(1) applies.  "(1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern."
11. We note that the Government intends to award an FFP contract. And yet, regarding the scope of work to be performed, as summarized in the notice, there are activities like support services and development for which it is often very difficult to produce fixed-price costs, unless the scope is very well defined, e.g., 1000 hours of on-site end user support. Does the Government intend to set the scope for all services rendered under the contract?The solicitation will detail specifics.
12. Does the Government intend to share the budget limitations for this procurement? This will help contractors understand the total scope that the Government has in mind, and therefore enhance competition.No.
