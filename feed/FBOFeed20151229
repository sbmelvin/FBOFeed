Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.  
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. 
22.	UID:  If unit price exceeds $5,000.00 then UID requirements will apply.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Synopsis of Proposed Contract Action: Hardware Software Integration Facility (HSIF)
<p>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) intends to solicit and award to Allen Corporation of America, Inc. a sole source additional 12-month option on the Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract W15P7T-12-C-C936 in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, for continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. This service will provide warehouse operational services and hardware software integration support to Product Leader, Logistics Information Systems.</p>
<p>The HSIF is responsible for the receipt of computer components, integration of components into system configurations, system and component storage, and the issuing/shipment of complete functional computer systems or components in support of Army requirements for Army Tactical Logistics Systems. These systems are combat essential systems for all Army tactical organizations and the HSIF services are vital to the Army's tactical supply operations.</p>
<p>The proposed additional option will allow continuance of the HSIF services to provide time necessary for ACC-RI to properly compete and award the follow-on contract. The period of performance is 03 March 2016 through 02 March 2017.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis, which shall be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<a href="mailto:Audrey.R.Gonzalez@nasa.gov">Audrey R. Gonzalez</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for one (1) LIQUID ARGON VESSEL AND LIQUID ARGON GAS for this vessel over the next five (5) years as needed, if needed. <p> The liquid argon vessel is currently installed in the Altitude Combustion Stand (ACS) Facility at the NASA GRC.  The vessel is a 1500-gallon liquid argon withdrawal vessel that is capable of being pressurized to 175 psig.  GRC is reactivating the ACS facility and now requires a source of liquid argon.   <p> In July of 2015, the decision was made at Center Level to reactivate the ACS facility including the wide variety of test facility support systems that allow for the testing of rocket engines with a variety of propellants.  An ACS facility assessment has been performed from July 2015 to November 2015 to determine the functionality, status, and repair/updates required for each system.  As a demonstration of reactivation, an engine hot fire test milestone is scheduled in June 2016.  That milestone will be met using a liquid oxygen/liquid methane engine that was previously tested in the facility at the time the Propulsion and Cryogenics Advanced Development (PCAD) program ended in 2010. Liquid argon is a key component to the success of liquid methane propellant conditioning capability.   <p> In 2008, GRC rented the liquid argon vessel from the supplier that had a liquid delivery tank in the quantities and supply pressure that met GRC specifications for the PCAD and propellant conditioning system.  Since the end of the PCAD program in October 2010, the vessel has remained on site integrated with the liquid argon system but unused and without charge.  Valley National was the original owner of the vessel which has since been purchased by Matheson Gas and is now the owner of the vessel.  As mentioned above, the liquid argon system and supply is an essential subsystem to meet hot fire test milestone.  Benefits of purchasing the existing vessel are that it would minimize the impact to schedule, maximize cost savings, and allow the Government to meet the schedule milestone to have the liquid argon system up and fully functional for checkout testing in March 2016.  Delays in having a fully operational liquid argon system would result in a day for day slip in the hot fire demonstration milestone and would impact the start date of a follow-on test.  <p> The Government will also purchase all liquid argon gas used for this vessel exclusively from Matheson Gas only as needed for the next five years.  The Government will issue delivery orders (DO) when supplies are needed and the price for the liquid argon gas will be a market-based price at the time the DO is issued. <p> The purchase of the existing unit and liquid argon gas on a requirements basis is in the best interest of the Government as it allows NASA to expeditiously reactivate the ASC for full functionality with minimal delays and assures NASA a market-priced supply source of liquid argon when needed.   <p> NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Matheson Tri-Gas, Inc. <p> The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. <p> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 5, 2016.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. <p> Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. <p> All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. <p> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html">http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/p ub_library/Omb.html </A>  .

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON A LATER DATE.
<p><br />The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), NCI, plans, assesses, and coordinates all aspects of cancer treatment clinical trials. CTEP develops new pharmacological and biological agents for the treatment of cancers. CTEP's responsibilities for developing, designing, conducting, and managing ethical clinical trials requires the collection, assimilation, storage, analysis, and communication of this clinical data within and outside of CTEP.</p>
<p>In April 1996 the Report of the Clinical Trials Program Review Group (Armitage Committee) described the clinical trials system as "an intricate and large research laboratory without walls". In order to support the mission of CTEP in the larger context of a laboratory without walls concept, the Protocol and Information Office (PIO) was organized to serve as the liaison between CTEP and the oncology community doing business with CTEP, while providing operational and administrative assistance to the protocol development process.</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to support the PIO by coordinating all administrative aspects related to clinical trial development, in order to ensure that quality protocols are developed in the most expeditious and efficient manner possible. To that end, the contractor shall: 1) collect, process, track, and monitor all protocol-related information between CTEP and its extramural collaborators (investigators, Cooperative Groups, Cancer Centers, FDA, pharmaceutical industry, other NCI programs, etc.); 2) utilize various database and document tracking/review applications to electronically track protocols from the first submission of the idea-termed a letter of intent (Phases I and II) or concept review (Phase III)-through the review process and on through the conduct of the study (monitoring data, amendments, toxicity alert letters) to final completion; 3) abstract key information including data elements, milestones, and treatment descriptors into the CTEP-Enterprise System (CTEP-ESYS) to facilitate informed and timely program decision-making; and 4) assist CTEP with implementing and tracking Operational Efficiency Working Group (OEWG) timelines. The work is currently being conducted under contract HHSN261200900014C held by the Cabezon Group, Inc.</p>
<p>The NCI seeks continuation of services to be acquired through competitive 8(a) set-aside procedures under NAICS 541611. It is anticipated that a cost-reimbursement, completion-type contract with a base period of one year and four one year option periods may be awarded beginning on or about May 31, 2016.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically at a later date and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. WE ENCOURAGE ALL RESPONSIBLE 8(a) SOURCES TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE AGENCY. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile or email transmissions will be accepted. IT IS THE OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO MONITOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED SITE FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.</p>

<DESC>The Officer in Charge requires all labor, management, supervision, tools, material and  equipment and other items necessary to provide Grounds and Landscaping Services at Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek  Fort Story, Virginia Beach, Virginia and Naval Weapons Station Yorktown, Yorktown, Virginia. The work includes but is not limited to:  mowing and trimming, edging, irrigation systems maintenance. Weed control is intended to be primarily accomplished by application of herbicides.
The work identified is to be provided by means of a combination Firm-Fixed Price/Indefinite Quantity type of contract.   Source Selection procedures will be used to select the proposal that provides the lowest price and is technically acceptable to the government.
 Offerors will be evaluated using the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable Method.  In order to permit efficient competition, the Navy will utilize the following methodology:  Proposals will initially be screened for price and placed in order of price (lowest price to highest price).  The Navy will then evaluate the technical factors of the three (3) lowest priced proposals.  The Navy will make award to the lowest priced technically acceptable proposal from among the three (3) lowest priced proposals.  However, if no proposals are found to be technically acceptable within the first group of proposals, the Navy, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to increase the number of proposals it will review, until the Government identifies a technically acceptable proposal.
  Accordingly, under this methodology, the technical factors of some proposals may not be evaluated by the Navy.  Proposers are advised that the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions or any contact concerning the proposals received.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms.  Proposers should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss or revise their proposals.  If discussions are deemed necessary by the Contracting Officer, all proposals will be evaluated (both non-price and price) for the purpose of establishing a competitive range.

The solicitation and resulting contract award will be a performance-based service acquisition made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the Request for Proposals (RFP), will be advantageous to the Government price and other evaluation factors considered.
  The offerors proposal shall contain a response to each of the evaluation factors and shall be in the form prescribed by the solicitation. The solicitation requires the evaluation of price and the following non-price factors:  Factor 1  Technical Approach/Management, Factor 2  Corporate Experience, Factor 3  Safety and Factor 4  Past Performance.  NOTE:  Offerors MUST be evaluated as technically ACCEPTABLE under factors 1, 2, 3 and 4 in order to be considered technically acceptable overall.

Offers shall be submitted for the performance of work for a period of one year.  However, the initial term of the contract may be for a period of less than one year.  The Government has the option to extend the term of the contract services for additional periods of one to twelve months.

<SUBJECT>16--NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) will be soliciting for a Repair BASIC ORDERING AGREEMENT (BOA) to Lockheed Martin, Owego (03640) located in Owego NY.

<DESC> The BOA will provide for the furnishing of labor, material, reports and parts as may be required to restore 50 NIINs to serviceable operating condition on the P-3 aircraft. The BOA will be for a period of five (5) years. The total projected expenditure for the five years total $25.5 million dollars. Please see attached documentation for exact listing of NIINs, along with corresponding output NIIN.

Lockheed Martin (03640) is located in Owego, NY and is the only known source to possess full repair capability. This procurement is being processed in accordance with FAR Par 15.  The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
 Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at (also see attached documents): 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer.
 Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. 

Responses to this notice of intent shall be submitted no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this synopsis to NAVSUP WSS Philadelphia, Attn: Ms. Jennifer McCaffrey, Contract Specialist, Code (N732.35), 700 Robbins Ave, Bldg 1, Philadelphia, PA 19111.

For information or questions regarding this notice, please contact Ms.
 Jennifer McCaffrey by e-mail jennifer.mccaffrey@navy.mil or phone (215) 697-6501

<DESC>NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) will be soliciting for a Repair Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) to EATON HISS, in FAREHAM, HAMPSHIRE UK (K2523).  The BOA will provide for the furnishing of labor, material, reports and parts as may be required to restore 6 NIINs to serviceable operating condition on the AV8B. The BOA will be for a period of five (5) years. This is for year 2 of 5.  The total projected expenditure for the five years total $13.9 million dollars.    Please see attached documentation for exact listing of NIINs.

Eaton is located in the UK and is the the only known source to possess full repair capability.  Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c)(1).  The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.
 This brochure can be obtained by calling NAVSUP WSS at (215) 697- 4243 or is available on-line at: 

https://www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

Specialty engineering consultants may be required.  Requirements will vary for each task order and will be defined in the task order scope of work.  Work may be in preparation for design-build or design-bid-build projects.  The complete scope of work that will be in the resulting IDIQ contracts is attached to this announcement.

In accordance with FAR 36.602-1, application packages will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1.	Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.  Provide resumes of all key personnel, including key personnel with sub-consultants.  Key personnel are defined as the lead architect or discipline engineer, project manager and quality control manager assigned to this contract.  Key personnel are required to be licensed or certified professionals as applicable.  The evaluation will consider education, training, registration, overall and relevant experience and longevity with the firm.  Individuals identified as key personnel shall be the same individuals performing these positions under the resulting contract and task orders.  Any changes in the proposed key team members and sub-consultants must be approved by the contracting officer.

2.	Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reductions, the use of recovered materials and sustainable design.

Specific projects should include remodeling, renovation and new construction at operating medical facilities.  At least one project should be for the renovation of electrical and mechanical systems in an occupied facility.

3.	Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.  Describe the firm's ability to utilize an adequate number of personnel and the proposed team's ability to complete several small task orders concurrently.  Task orders may be for a wide range of projects and may require a quick turn-around.  Information provided shall include the workload availability of the firm and sub-consultants as well as any specialized equipment that may be available.

4.	Past performance on contracts with government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules.  In addition to information submitted, the government will consider information obtained from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and any other sources deemed necessary by the government.

5.	Location in the general geographical area of the facilities covered in this announcement as well as knowledge of the locality of the project provided that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms.  Award of contracts will be weighted based on proximity to the facilities.

In accordance with FAR 36.602-1, the board will consider secondary factors set forth in the Veterans Affairs Acquisition Regulation (VAAR) at 836.602-1.

1.	Reputation and standing of the firm and its principle officials with respect professional performance, general management, and cooperativeness.  This criterion will be applied to proposed sub-consultants.

2.	Record of significant claims against the client because of improper or incomplete architectural and engineering services.

3.	Specific experience and qualifications of personnel and sub-consultants proposed for assignment to this contract and their record of working together as a team.

To assist the government in selecting the most highly qualified contractor, those firms slated as highly qualified may be interviewed or asked to submit supplemental responses.

After evaluation and establishment of the list of most highly rated firms, consideration will be given in the following order:

1.	Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses;

2.	Veteran-Owned Small Businesses;

3.	All other small businesses

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT<br />U.S. ARMY RDECOM-TARDEC<br />VEHICLE CYBER TECHNOLOGY CONSORTIUM DEVELOPMENT
<p><br />Description of Intent<br />This is a Sources Sought inquiry and not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking offerors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Sources Sought or any follow-up information requests. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.</p>
<p>General Information B<br />The Government's explicit intent, in this Sources Sought, is to not receive from respondents any proprietary data, trade secrets, business sensitive information, or information considered CONFIDENTIAL under 18 U.S.C. &sect;1905. The Government's constraint does not in any way relieve respondents from their responsibility to properly mark proprietary data when it is provided, in accordance with DFARS 252.227-7013, nor does it alleviate any requirement for the Government to protect marked data. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.</p>
<p>Respondents shall ensure that any material and data that is provided is marked appropriately to ensure proper handling of all information. Unless otherwise noted herein, anything submitted in response to this Sources Sought will not be returned to the sender. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the survey or results of information submitted, nor will the Government respond to telephone or email inquiries. NOTE: The Government is not asking you to develop or provide drawings or develop any technical data in response to this Sources Sought.</p>
<p>Please note that Other Transaction Authorities (OTA) are not required to comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), its supplements (i.e. DFARS), or laws that are limited in applicability to procurement contracts. To be eligible for an OTA, the proposing contractor must be a non-traditional contractor or have at least one non-traditional defense contractor participating to a significant extent OR provide a one-third cost share (see Department of Defense (DoD) Other Transactions (OT) Guide for Prototype Projects).</p>
<p>Introduction/Objective<br />The Army Contracting Command - Warren (ACC-WRN), in support of the Tank Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC), intends to solicit, negotiate, and enter into a Section 845 Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) for Prototypes under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371 with a consortium focused on vehicle cyber security technologies. Although it is anticipated that a majority of the projects awarded under the OTA will be for prototypes, there may be projects for research as well, which also fall under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371.</p>
<p>The Government has a need to collaborate with educational, nonprofit, and commercial partners, across barriers that include military/civilian, public/private, local/regional/national, and political/jurisdictional concerns, through the establishment of a consortium to perform a coordinated research and development program under an OTA for Prototypes designed to develop various vehicle cyber technologies to improve current U.S. industry, university, and Government capabilities. The consortium should be open to new membership and display a broad array of expertise and experience connected to vehicle cyber related technologies and applications.</p>
<p>Consortium members shall perform research, development, and engineering activities, which address the Army's long-range goals. Examples of such activities include, but are not limited to the (i) enhancement and/or defeat of cryptography used to secure data in vehicle systems; (ii) response to active cyberattacks that have penetrated cyber defenses in a vehicle system; (iii) tools for vehicle digital forensics; (iv) methods for demonstrating unauthorized control or service denial to a target vehicle platform; (v) computational trust and deep learning applied to defending against unwanted behavior changes in multi-agent systems; (vi) development and enhancement of measurement, analysis, and verification methods for vehicle architectures; (vii) development of Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S) toolsets for testing potential vehicle architecture safeguards and solutions; and (viii) development of any other technologies that identify, isolate, counter, eliminate, and protect against cyber threats to vehicles.</p>
<p>TARDEC will engage in broad areas of research and development leading to capability demonstrations in vehicle penetration testing, resilient vehicle architectures, and the modeling, simulation, and analysis of cyber-physical vehicle systems. TARDEC will also foster specialized education and training, as necessary, consistent with its strategic goals.</p>
<p>Responses Due<br />Electronic responses to this Sources Sought must be received NO LATER THAN CLOSE OF BUSINESS 29 JANUARY 2016. Please submit all responses and any questions prior to full response to: Brandon Pender at brandon.n.pender.civ@mail.mil and Troy Haarala at troy.r.haarala.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC>FEMA<br />Response Directorate: Air Transportation Services<br />Request for Information: HSFE70-16-I-0006
<p>INTRODUCTION<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and market research planning purposes; it does not constitute a solicitation or a promise to issue a solicitation. Furthermore, those who respond to this RFI should not anticipate feedback with regards to its submission; other than acknowledgment of receipt - ONLY IF a request for an acknowledgement is requested by the submitter. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is not seeking proposals at this time. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay any costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation.</p>
<p>The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government, and will not be returned.</p>
<p>Any information that the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such.</p>
<p>1. Background: <br />a. Summary: The Response Directorate within FEMA coordinates and provides the core Federal disaster response capability needed to save lives, reduce suffering, and protect property in communities throughout the Nation that have been overwhelmed by the impact of a major disaster or emergency, regardless of cause. The Response Directorate must ensure that Federal emergency response systems and capabilities are properly poised to lean forward to support States and communities overwhelmed by disasters and emergencies. Support to declared or undeclared emergencies and disaster response operations where the location of performance will vary depending on operational needs. The source shall be able to provide turn-key air transportation support and services to support at all locations (departure, intermediate, and arrival airfields) specified to include ground transport, if required, for personnel, equipment, cargo and vehicles from organization home station to departure airfield or designated location and at destination airfield to the disaster with the ability to retain transport and drivers for extended periods or until released by FEMA throughout the Continental United States, as well as Alaska and Hawaii, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands.<br />b. Current State: FEMA has a contract in place with sufficient personnel, equipment and materials to enable at least 10 hours per day utilization of each aircraft required. The contractor provides documentation and justification of how the 10 hour per day utilization rate will be achieved immediately to the Government, as requested. <br />During an emergency, the contract provides air transportation services on a 24 hour, 7 day per week basis, with a 5-hour response time to the designated team or task force point of departure with the responding aircraft and crew ready for onward flight. The contract responds within the specified timeframe on a 24-hour/7 day per week basis.</p>
<p>c. Capabilities: FEMA may need to transport responders, personnel, cargo, equipment and vehicles to affected areas. FEMA may also need to transport Critical Transportation Need (CTN) individuals. CTNs are evacuees who don't have a means to evacuate on their own. The current planning assumption requires evacuating up to 20,000 CTN evacuees from an area of impact to a safe harbor location either within the state of impact or another state or U.S. location. To meet this need, FEMA requires a source of air transportation services for various types of charter jet aircraft. A source of this type will enable FEMA to proactively support the emergency response needs associated with natural, technological and man-made disasters in a timely manner.</p>

<DESC><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R&amp;D requirement. Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.</span>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="BACKGROUND: white; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">BACKGROUND</span></span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"> </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><br />The National Institute on Aging (NIA) has a need for a project entitled, The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span Home Visit Program (HHVP). Health disparities are marked differences or inequalities in health measures, such as disability or mortality, between two or more population groups based on race or ethnicity, gender, education, socioeconomic status (SES), or other criteria. Health disparities among ethnic minorities, the poor, and the medically underserved are well documented nationally and internationally. From perspective of the National Institute on Aging (NIA), understanding health disparities is linked to understanding aging because health disparities are characteristically seen in commonly occurring age-associated diseases such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease as well as diabetes mellitus and cancer. The challenge to investigating health disparities and minority aging is designing and implementing studies that recruit and retain a racially and socioeconomically diverse cohort. Unfortunately, the failure to consistently include minority and socioeconomically diverse research participants has hampered efforts to address disparate health outcomes and conduct successful translational research in many areas of clinical research. With this background, the NIA developed the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study to investigate whether race and socioeconomic status influence health and age-related health disparities separately or synergistically as co-factors of behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">HANDLS is a prospective population-based interdisciplinary, longitudinal study with an initial cohort of 3721 individuals who represent working-age African Americans and whites initially between 30-64 years old recruited as a fixed cohort of participants by household screenings from an area probability sample of twelve neighborhoods (contiguous census tracts) in Baltimore City and one dress rehearsal neighborhood. Power analyses for longitudinal analyses after twenty years of follow-up with repeated assessments every three years specify at least 80% power for a minimum sample size of 30 participants per cell defined by race (African American, white), socioeconomic status (self-reported household income based on 125% of the 2004 Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines), age (seven 5-year age groups 30-64 years old), and sex. We identified neighborhoods that were likely to yield representative distributions of Baltimore City with sufficient individuals to fill the sampling design based on 2000 census data. The study domains examined in the baseline wave included: cognitive function, nutrition, neighborhood environment, anthropometry, cardiovascular health, physical performance, health services, molecular markers, genomics and psychology. The follow-up waves have added measures on personality, nephrology, neuroimaging, health literacy, and economic strain.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The Wave 3 re-visit examinations in the study began in July 2009. Evaluation of the success of the retention strategy is incomplete but data from the neighborhoods revisited thus far shows that the retention rate is 91% for those participants able to complete their follow-up examination. However, as HANDLS collects further information about our participants, it has become apparent there is a sub-population whose health status prevents them from completing the follow-up examination on NIA's Medical Research Vehicles. HANDLS is at risk for collecting biased follow-up data because this subpopulation is more likely to be lower socioeconomic status (OR = 3.15 95%CI = 1.70-5.82) and older (OR = 3.80 95%CI = 1.92-7.51). This suggests that NIA must examine this subgroup of participants to accurately assess the extent to which they have changed since the initial assessment. To avoid non-random missing data, the NIA developed the HANDLS Home Visit Program (HHVP). This protocol is designed to allow participants who are home bound or disabled to continue to participate in the HANDLS study as scheduled. Epidemiologists are unanimous in advising that collecting as complete data as possible is the most effective way to avoid biases introduced by non-random missing data. The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH-E9) guidelines state, "no universally applicable methods of handling missing values can be recommended" and they advise collected as much complete data as possible. Providing an alternative to the examination visit on the Medical Research Vehicles allows the NIA to collect valuable data about the influences of race and socioeconomic status on the development of age-related health disparities and disability among socioeconomically diverse African Americans and whites in Baltimore.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="BACKGROUND: white; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; BACKGROUND: white; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><br /></span></span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This procurement shall acquire the services of a contractor for a 5-year period to perform home-based medical evaluations for HANDLS participants who are unable to visit the NIA's Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs) for their follow-up medical evaluations. This HANDLS substudy is called the HANDLS Home Visit Program (HHVP). Initially, the NIA will require approximately 50 home visits per year conducted primarily in the Baltimore metropolitan area, but also in other areas to which participants may have moved. Home visit medical evaluations shall be performed according to the HANDLS timeline specified for participants' scheduled follow-up MRV visits. The first year will also include home visits that are out of sequence (behind the usual scheduled appointment date) because HANDLS was unable to evaluate the participant on the MRV when initially scheduled.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The main objectives of the procurement are: (1) to perform follow-up study evaluations on all HHVP participants identified by the Government; (2) create, implement, and manage a database tracking system for classifying all HHVP participants. The database will provide complete verification of the status of HANDLS home visit participants and shall include information indicating who are active and willing to participate, who completed a home visit, who have died, and who refuse the home visit (as they occur), and also up-to-date demographic and contact information for all home visit participants; (3) Increase the value of the study by reducing the biasing effect of "informative censoring" (non-random missing data); (4) Expand the collection of biological samples in participants who have developed substantial comorbidity and disability.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="BACKGROUND: white; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">BACKGROUND</span></span></strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"> </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt"><br />The National Institute on Aging (NIA) has a need for a project entitled, The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span Home Visit Program (HHVP). Health disparities are marked differences or inequalities in health measures, such as disability or mortality, between two or more population groups based on race or ethnicity, gender, education, socioeconomic status (SES), or other criteria. Health disparities among ethnic minorities, the poor, and the medically underserved are well documented nationally and internationally. From perspective of the National Institute on Aging (NIA), understanding health disparities is linked to understanding aging because health disparities are characteristically seen in commonly occurring age-associated diseases such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease as well as diabetes mellitus and cancer. The challenge to investigating health disparities and minority aging is designing and implementing studies that recruit and retain a racially and socioeconomically diverse cohort. Unfortunately, the failure to consistently include minority and socioeconomically diverse research participants has hampered efforts to address disparate health outcomes and conduct successful translational research in many areas of clinical research. With this background, the NIA developed the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study to investigate whether race and socioeconomic status influence health and age-related health disparities separately or synergistically as co-factors of behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">HANDLS is a prospective population-based interdisciplinary, longitudinal study with an initial cohort of 3721 individuals who represent working-age African Americans and whites initially between 30-64 years old recruited as a fixed cohort of participants by household screenings from an area probability sample of twelve neighborhoods (contiguous census tracts) in Baltimore City and one dress rehearsal neighborhood. Power analyses for longitudinal analyses after twenty years of follow-up with repeated assessments every three years specify at least 80% power for a minimum sample size of 30 participants per cell defined by race (African American, white), socioeconomic status (self-reported household income based on 125% of the 2004 Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines), age (seven 5-year age groups 30-64 years old), and sex. We identified neighborhoods that were likely to yield representative distributions of Baltimore City with sufficient individuals to fill the sampling design based on 2000 census data. The study domains examined in the baseline wave included: cognitive function, nutrition, neighborhood environment, anthropometry, cardiovascular health, physical performance, health services, molecular markers, genomics and psychology. The follow-up waves have added measures on personality, nephrology, neuroimaging, health literacy, and economic strain.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The Wave 3 re-visit examinations in the study began in July 2009. Evaluation of the success of the retention strategy is incomplete but data from the neighborhoods revisited thus far shows that the retention rate is 91% for those participants able to complete their follow-up examination. However, as HANDLS collects further information about our participants, it has become apparent there is a sub-population whose health status prevents them from completing the follow-up examination on NIA's Medical Research Vehicles. HANDLS is at risk for collecting biased follow-up data because this subpopulation is more likely to be lower socioeconomic status (OR = 3.15 95%CI = 1.70-5.82) and older (OR = 3.80 95%CI = 1.92-7.51). This suggests that NIA must examine this subgroup of participants to accurately assess the extent to which they have changed since the initial assessment. To avoid non-random missing data, the NIA developed the HANDLS Home Visit Program (HHVP). This protocol is designed to allow participants who are home bound or disabled to continue to participate in the HANDLS study as scheduled. Epidemiologists are unanimous in advising that collecting as complete data as possible is the most effective way to avoid biases introduced by non-random missing data. The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH-E9) guidelines state, "no universally applicable methods of handling missing values can be recommended" and they advise collected as much complete data as possible. Providing an alternative to the examination visit on the Medical Research Vehicles allows the NIA to collect valuable data about the influences of race and socioeconomic status on the development of age-related health disparities and disability among socioeconomically diverse African Americans and whites in Baltimore.</span></p>

This HANDLS substudy is called the HANDLS Home Visit Program (HHVP). Initially, the NIA will require approximately 50 home visits per year conducted primarily in the Baltimore metropolitan area, but also in other areas to which participants may have moved. Home visit medical evaluations shall be performed according to the HANDLS timeline specified for participants' scheduled follow-up MRV visits. The first year will also include home visits that are out of sequence (behind the usual scheduled appointment date) because HANDLS was unable to evaluate the participant on the MRV when initially scheduled.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The main objectives of the procurement are: (1) to perform follow-up study evaluations on all HHVP participants identified by the Government; (2) create, implement, and manage a database tracking system for classifying all HHVP participants. The database will provide complete verification of the status of HANDLS home visit participants and shall include information indicating who are active and willing to participate, who completed a home visit, who have died, and who refuse the home visit (as they occur), and also up-to-date demographic and contact information for all home visit participants; (3) Increase the value of the study by reducing the biasing effect of "informative censoring" (non-random missing data); (4) Expand the collection of biological samples in participants who have developed substantial comorbidity and disability.</span></p>

<CONTACT>Tammy A. Taylor, Phone 6174943462, Email tammy.taylor@dot.gov
<DESC>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) only. It is not a solicitation nor does it guarantee a solicitation will be issued. This is an RFI for the purpose of conducting market research to determine the availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to determining the method of acquisition. Submission of any information in response to this sources sought notice is COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice.<br /><br />BACKGROUND: The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe) is currently performing an independent review for the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA's) Office of Policy regarding the process by which roadside safety hardware is deemed eligible for Federal-aid reimbursement. As a part of Volpe's evaluation, Volpe is requesting information from parties involved in the development, evaluation, and implementation of roadside safety hardware to obtain feedback and input related to their role(s) within the process. Volpe is currently looking at the development, evaluation, funding, implementation, and assessment processes with respect to roadside safety hardware. This evaluation involves examining the current Federal-aid reimbursement eligibility process for roadside safety hardware from the initial development of new or modified hardware through the installation and in-service evaluation phases. This review may result in improvement/change recommendations being made to FHWA or other organizations involved in the roadside hardware evaluation process.<br /><br />SCOPE: Volpe is seeking information on the processes by which roadside safety hardware is developed, evaluated, tested, implemented, and assessed.<br /><br />In Volpe's ongoing review of the roadside safety hardware evaluation process, Volpe has generally identified four phases of hardware development, evaluation, and implementation as follows:<br /><br />1. Development, evaluation and testing of new or modified roadside safety hardware;<br />2. Consideration of Federal-aid reimbursement eligibility;<br />3. Consideration of State acceptance; and,<br />4. Hardware installation and in-service assessments.<br /><br />Note that not every phase is required for each hardware development effort. For example, FHWA does not require a letter of Federal-aid reimbursement eligibility for a piece of hardware to be eligible for Federal-aid reimbursement.<br /><br />This RFI invites parties to submit comments related to any of these phases, including, but not limited to, the following:<br /><br />1.&nbsp; Designing and/or modifying roadside safety hardware devices;<br />2.&nbsp; Development and implementation of roadside safety hardware testing criteria and procedures;<br />3.&nbsp; Testing and/or analysis of roadside safety hardware;<br />4.&nbsp; Federal-aid reimbursement eligibility determination process for roadside safety hardware;<br />5.&nbsp; State evaluation processes for roadside safety hardware;<br />6.&nbsp; Installation and maintenance of roadside safety hardware;<br />7.&nbsp; Inventory tracking of roadside safety hardware;<br />8.&nbsp; In-service performance evaluations of roadside safety hardware;<br />9.&nbsp; Sharing of relevant roadside safety data among stakeholders; and/or,<br />10.&nbsp; Recently-implemented changes to the roadside safety hardware evaluation process<br /><br />This RFI is intended to better inform Volpe as to the existing roadside safety hardware development and evaluation process, and to assist Volpe in identifying potential areas for improvement within the process.<br /><br />Interested parties&nbsp;should submit a capabilities package describing&nbsp;their process(es) that addresses the requirements&nbsp;of this RFI. Additionally, the Volpe Center is interested in a rough order of magnitude for each described process, as applicable. The preferred format for documentation is PDF. There is no page limit for responses to this RFI, however, it is requested only the&nbsp;pertinent information addressing the needs of this RFI be&nbsp;provided. Each response should reference this RFI's title, and provide the name and contact information (company, phone, email, etc.) of the submitter, at a minimum. Interested parties are requested to respond to this announcement in writing as soon as possible but not later than 12 January 2016. Telephone requests will not be honored. All responses should be sent via e-mail to tammy.taylor@dot.gov.<br /><br />The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award a competitive acquisition. The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this notice and submittals will not be returned to the sender. For information about the Volpe Center, please refer to its&nbsp;website at http://www.volpe.dot.gov.<br />

<DESC>Synoposis:<br />U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in January.
<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.secure.force.com/AAAP. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.</p>
<p>The Open Period for January is January 1, 2015 to January 7, 2015, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.secure.force.com/AAAP).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.</p>
<p>This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2014 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>If you have previously submitted an offer, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the new RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.   <br /> <br />OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.<br /> <br />DELINEATED AREA:  Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and certain counties in New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.<br /> <br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 10 years.</p>

<DESC><br />The U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP) in January.   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future requirements.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides are offered in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'**. For assistance with the application, email AAAP.Manager@gsa.gov.<br /> <br />The Open Period for January is January 1, 2016 to January 7, 2016, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program November 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016 or until it is replaced. <br /><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2015, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2016 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually.   Please be sure to review each page prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP.  Your previous offered space will not be copied.<br /> <br />OCCUPANCY: Space offered must be vacant and ready for commencement of tenant alterations within 60 days of this notice.<br /> <br />DELINEATED AREA:  All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the listed RLP must be located within Region 2.
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.<br /> <br />Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed.<br /> <br />LEASE TERM:  Up to 10 years.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), National Agricultural Library (NAL) in Beltsville, MD, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures with the American Society of Agronomy (ASA), 5585 Guilford Road, Fitchburg, WI 53711-1086, to provide electronic access via the internet for all USDA users to the ACSESS Digital Library, a complete collection of all content published by the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America. (ASA-CSSA-SSSA). NAL requires electronic access via the internet for use by all USDA employees, authorized public on-site users, cooperators, and volunteers working on behalf of USDA and acting within the scope of their relationship with USDA during the period of performance. Access must include perpetual data rights to the content.
<p>The circumstance permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) and 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or source will meet agency needs. The National Agricultural Library (NAL) is mandated (7 U.S.C. 3101) to serve as the primary agricultural information resource of the United States. One of its functions in that role is the acquisition of information in all aspects of agriculture and allied sciences. In support of this function, the NAL acquires journal publications in electronic format from publishers and makes the journals accessible to USDA employees and library patrons via the internet. In keeping with its charge to collect agricultural and related information, it seeks to maintain a collection of publications in various formats from a variety of publishers and sources. USDA researchers have demonstrated the importance of this journal content by their heavy past use of the electronic versions of the journals, made accessible by NAL's DigiTop service. NAL would like to continue to benefit from them. <br /><br />The American Society of Agronomy is the only vendor that can meet NAL's requirement for journal access with perpetual access to the content issued during the period of performance. The American Society of Agronomy is the only copyright holder of its publications and thus is the only source of the access NAL seeks. Having perpetual access rights granted by American Society of Agronomy will give USDA users access in perpetuity to the electronic journals for which NAL purchases access. There is no source but the American Society of Agronomy for the electronic content of the subscribed publications with perpetual access rights. <br />The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 511120 is applicable. This is a lowest price, technically acceptable procurement.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. This notice is for informational purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Vendors that believe they can provide the services listed above are invited to submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">System Overview</span></p>
<p>EPS is an <span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">Extremely High Frequency (EHF) Satellite Communications (SATCOM)</span> system that will provide communications support <span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">in the North Polar Region</span> to meet strategic, operational, and tactical mission requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>EPS will employ payloads on two satellites in a Molniya, highly elliptical orbit to provide coverage 365 days per year and 24 hours per day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These payloads will be integrated onto another organization's satellite system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>EPS will include ground control and planning infrastructure to provide a payload command and control (C2) capability and to plan allocation of payload resources to polar user terminals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>EPS will also include a ground gateway infrastructure to provide polar users with access to terrestrial communications services that connect with mid-latitude users. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>EPS will support C2 of Joint Forces operating beyond the reach of traditional communications capabilities, connecting individual commanders, while simultaneously improving the speed and quality of decision processes throughout the military organization as a whole.</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">EPS represents an evolution of capabilities for protected EHF SATCOM in the North Polar Region, above 65 degrees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span>EPS provides continuous coverage to terminals operating in the polar region and supports secure, jam-resistant, strategic and tactical communications between polar forces and mid-latitude users.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">The system provides the capability to carry secure teletype, encoded voice, and data communications.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>EPS Initial Operational Capability (IOC) and Full Operational Capability (FOC) are both planned for summer 2018. SMC/MC is responsible for acquiring O&amp;M support for the following EPS operations:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Control and Planning Operations:</span></p>
<p>Control and planning operations at SAFB consists of both real-time T&amp;C operations and offline communication and cryptographic planning activities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The EPS payload is hosted on a classified space vehicle (SV).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result, payload command and control responsibility is shared between SAFB payload control and planning operations and Host SV control and planning operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Real-time payload T&amp;C operations at SAFB will include the following capabilities:</p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-themecolor: text1">-Monitor telemetry for payload status and resource usage<br /></span><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-themecolor: text1">-Set up and tear down payload T&amp;C networks<br /></span><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-themecolor: text1">-Manage the distribution of </span><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">payload and terminal cryptographic keys, including Over the Air Rekey<br /></span><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">-Provide for payload clock management</span></p>
<p>These activities are envisioned to require 24/7 support in order to ensure continuous connectivity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>The offline planning activities include both EPS communication planning for user communications and cryptographic planning for payload and terminal equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These activities are envisioned as offline activities not requiring 24/7 support.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gateway and T&amp;C Terminal Operations:</span></p>
<p>The gateway operations at CAFS consist of operations and site maintenance of baseband, networking, and RF terminal equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The gateway will provide connectivity between polar and mid-latitude users by transporting EPS traffic to the Department of Defense (DoD) Teleport at Camp Roberts, California.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the Teleport, the traffic will be routed to users via either pre-arranged Navy backhaul services or DISN services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of the Molniya character of the payload orbits, operations of the gateway terminals will include communications handover between payloads, four times each day, as the one payload descends in its orbit and the second ascends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The gateway will include three Navy Multi-band Terminals (NMTs) to serve as communications terminals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two of the NMTs will provide connectivity to the two payloads when they are simultaneously in view of the gateway, with the third NMT serving as a backup terminal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Gateway operations will include management and configuration of the baseband and networking equipment to provide connectivity for both serial and Internet Protocol data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The operations of these terminals, networking, and baseband equipment is envisioned to require 24/7 support in order to ensure continuous user communication.</p>
<p>Because line-of-sight connectivity is not feasible between SAFB and the EPS payloads during the operational phases of their orbits, the EPS T&amp;C terminal is co-located with the gateway at CAFS, rather than at SAFB.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Operations of the terminal, associated interface hardware, and networking equipment is also envisioned to require 24/7 operations and maintenance in order to ensure continuous command and control of the payload.</p>

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development's Mission to the Philippines (USAID/Philippines) intends to award a contract modification to the Education Development Center to extend the Basa Pilipinas Project contract for a period of seventeen (17) months from January 2017 to May 2018 to expand activities to ensure the institutionalization and sustainability of the project's gains in the advancement of early grade literacy in the Philippines. The proposed modification is estimated at an additional $15 million and will increase the total estimated contract cost to $39,680,000.
<p>The additional funds will be used to carry out activities that will continue to provide technical assistance to the Philippines Department of Education (DepEd) particularly in the scale up of effective literacy instruction approaches and materials, provide additional resources to improve reading comprehension and provide additional investments at the Kindergarten level. This will be achieved through the following activities:<br />1.	Develop and deliver two cycles of training to all Kindergarten teachers in the existing project sites. The training will focus on the implementation of effective reading strategies, and the use of project-developed materials for Kindergarten.</p>
<p>2.	Develop, procure and distribute developmentally-appropriate teaching and learning materials for the Kindergarten level. Each Kindergarten student in all the existing project sites will be provided with these high-quality learning materials.</p>
<p>3.	Provide a refresher training for Grade 3 teachers in existing project sites to reinforce the appropriate use of leveled readers, pupil assessment and management of guided reading sessions.</p>
<p>4.	Respond to DepEd's request to facilitate the leveling of supplementary readers in the early grades for classroom libraries. Procure and distribute a complete set of supplementary readers for each classroom from Kindergarten to Grade 3 in all project sites.</p>
<p>5.	Pilot an intervention to assist teachers in providing targeted support to students with reading challenges. This will include training teachers on how to tailor instruction for struggling readers using the full range of existing project-developed materials and supplementary reading materials available in the school.</p>
<p>6.	Respond to DepEd's request to institutionalize the effective literacy online induction course for new teachers of the Kindergarten to Grade 3 levels.</p>

<p>8.	Respond to DepEd's request to provide training for the Curriculum and Instruction Division Chiefs on Effective Literacy Instruction to institutionalize the project's interventions.</p>
<p>9.	Design a simplified classroom observation literacy tool in a tablet format for school heads and division supervisors to assess classroom teaching practices of teachers in the early grades. Provide tablets to the school administrators. Train school heads, supervisors and other DepEd officials on classroom observation assessment and data analysis.</p>
<p>10.	Conduct advocacy activities for early grade reading at the national and local levels.</p>
<p>11.	Conduct an Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) data collection and analysis in Filipino and English at Grades 2 and 3 to track the progress in student learning outcomes in the project's existing school divisions.</p>
<p>12.	Conduct periodic monitoring visits to check on the availability and use of the project-developed teaching and learning materials in the classrooms.</p>
<p>13.	Build DepEd's capacity to conduct monitoring of the Learning Action Cells through joint monitoring activities and structured reflection and analysis.</p>
<p>14.	Conduct a quasi-experimental evaluation to determine the impact of the project's interventions at the Kindergarten level. Develop and pilot an assessment tool specific for the Kindergarten level. Pre- and post-assessment data will be collected on learning gains in a sample of schools in project sites.</p>
<p>15.	Conduct the Time 3 data collection for the project's research study on pupils' developmental trajectories and teacher practices in both Basa and non-Basa classrooms through accessing and tracking Grades 1 to 3 pupils' reading performance in Mother Tongue, Filipino and English.</p>

<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Oct 2014), applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability.</p>
<p>This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides a capabilities statement to include evidence of being a telecommunications company which has the ability to deliver Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID) and number portability at the Government demarcation point at the site specified in the Appendix 10 attachment, page 1</p>
<p><br />Subfactor 2 -Local Communication Services.</p>
<p>2a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror submits a sound approach for supporting local communication services in a detailed SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend. The diagram and legend should clearly illustrate the Offeror's capability to meet all SOW and site-specific Appendix 10 requirements. Reference the Appendix 10, para. 10.13 attachment A, "Traditional Legacy" and attachment B, "Utilizing SIP Trunking", or Offerors may use a combination of both attachments to submit the Offeror's diagram. Provide the requested diagram and legend using these formats or a similar format.</p>
<p>2b. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides a written description of each service that will be delivered in the site-specific diagram and the methodology of their delivery.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Evidence of Agreements.</p>
<p>This subfactor is met when the Offeror states whether your company is providing a proposal as a Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC). If providing a proposal as a CLEC for ANY and/or ALL services, provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 4 -- Diversity.</p>
<p>This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides a sound approach for supporting diversity in a detailed SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend. The diagram and legend should clearly illustrate the Offeror's ability to meet all diversity requirements in site-specific Appendix 10 and SOW.</p>
<p><br />(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE INFORMATION (DIAPR) 2010-14, Amendment 1

	CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTING SYSTEM (JULY 2010)

(a) FAR 42.1502 directs all Federal agencies to collect past performance information on contracts. The Department of the Interior (DOI) has implemented the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to comply with this regulation. One or more past performance evaluations will be conducted in order to record your contract performance as required by FAR 42.15. 

(b) The past performance evaluation process is a totally paperless process using CPARS. CPARS is a web-based system that allows for electronic processing of the performance evaluation report. Once the report is processed, it is available in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for Government use in evaluating past performance as part of a source selection action.

(c) We request that you furnish the Contracting Officer with the name, position title, phone number, and email address for each person designated to have access to your firm's past performance evaluation(s) for the contract no later than 30 days after award. Each person granted access will have the ability to provide comments in the Contractor portion of the report and state whether or not the Contractor agrees with the evaluation, before returning the report to the Assessing Official. The report information must be protected as source selection sensitive information not releasable to the public.

(d) When your Contractor Representative(s) (Past Performance Points of Contact) are registered in CPARS, they will receive an automatically-generated email with detailed login instructions. Further details, systems requirements, and training information for CPARS is available at http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. The CPARS User Manual, registration for On Line Training for Contractor Representatives, and a practice application may be found at this site.

(e) Within 60 days after the end of a performance period, the Contracting Officer will complete an interim or final past performance evaluation, and the report will be accessible at http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. Contractor Representatives may then provide comments in response to the evaluation, or return the evaluation without comment. Comments are limited to the space provided in Block 22. Your comments should focus on objective facts in the Assessing Official's narrative and should provide your views on the causes and ramifications of the assessed performance. In addition to the ratings and supporting narratives, blocks 1 - 17 should be reviewed for accuracy, as these include key fields that will be used by the Government to identify your firm in future source selection actions. If you elect not to provide comments, please acknowledge receipt of the evaluation by indicating "No comment" in Block 22, and then signing and dating Block 23 of the form. Without a statement in Block 22, you will be unable to sign and submit the evaluation back to the Government. If you do not sign and submit the CPAR within 30 days, it will automatically be returned to the Government and will be annotated: "The report was delivered/received by the contractor on (date). The contractor neither signed nor offered comment in response to this assessment." Your response is due within 30 calendar days after receipt of the CPAR.

(f) The following guidelines apply concerning your use of the past performance evaluation:

(1) Protect the evaluation as "source selection information." After review, transmit the evaluation by completing and submitting the form through CPARS. If for some reason you are unable to view and/or submit the form through CPARS, contact the Contracting Officer for instructions. 

(2) Strictly control access to the evaluation within your organization. Ensure the evaluation is never released to persons or entities outside of your control.

(3) Prohibit the use of or reference to evaluation data for advertising, promotional material, preaward surveys, responsibility determinations, production readiness reviews, or other similar purposes.

(g) If you wish to discuss a past performance evaluation, you should request a meeting in writing to the Contracting Officer no later than seven days following your receipt of the evaluation. The meeting will be held in person or via telephone or other means during your 30-day review period.

(h) A copy of the completed past performance evaluation will be available in CPARS for your viewing and for Government use supporting source selection actions after it has been finalized.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification, a Certificate of Conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM.  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  

The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause.  All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>(i) A sequential number.</p>
<p>(ii) The contract item which the "CFR" relates to.</p>

<p>(iv) A proposed or recommended repair to correct the defective condition.</p>
<p>(v) Indicate whether the report requires Cost Guard action, or if it is provided "for info" <br />only. If action is required, indicate the response time required by the Coast Guard and whether or not a contract extension would be needed if the additional work is authorized.</p>
<p>(vi) A space on the form for the Coast Guard to make comments.</p>
<p>(vii) All CFR's will be dated, submitted, and signed by a representative of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will respond to the Contractor's within 24 hours of receiving a Condition Found Report. A copy of ALL condition found reports shall be retained in the Cutter's file.</p>

If your quote is the lowest price, but your quote does not meet the technical specifications as set forth in this solicitation, you will not be awarded the contract. 
All proposals will be evaluated for responsiveness. Failure to submit all documentation as required may result in the submission being determined non-responsive and removed from further consideration.

The pricing worksheets shall be provided as Excel worksheets with formulas provided. <br />The hourly rate as proposed will be the basis for the Offeror's proposed price and establishes the maximum labor rate that can be charged for a particular labor category. This labor rate will be incorporated into the resultant contract by attachment.<br />The evaluated price will be the sum total of the offeror's proposed prices for the base year and all option years plus six months after the last option period to allow for the possibility that the Government may exercise the option at FAR 52.217-8. Thus, the Offeror's total price for the purpose of evaluation will include the base period and all option periods plus six month after the last option period. <br />The Offeror shall provide evidence indicating that its accounting system is adequate for accumulating and reporting incurred costs applicable to the contract and that acceptable systems are in place to track employee labor hours for the ability to invoice T&amp;M labor.

Submission of this information in the price volume is merely to facilitate review of the information by the appropriate evaluators.</p>
<p>14. Basis for Award-Offerors are notified that this acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.602 Streamlined Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, and supplemented with additional information included in the DOMEX Platform and Triage System Statement of Work (SOW). The rules, policies, and procedures of FAR Part 15.3 and DFARS 215.3 do not apply to this acquisition.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates a single award Time and Material (T&amp;M) contract. This is a Small Business Set-Aside, NAICS code 541519, Other Computer Related Services which is selected for this acquisition. Proposals will be reviewed and evaluated to determine if the proposal addresses all areas of the National Media Exploitation Center's (NMEC) Document and Media Exploitation Platform and Triage (DOMEX) System Statement of Work (SOW) requirement consistent with the Best Value source selection criteria provided below and is compliant with this Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the program objectives, with reasonable price.</p>
<p>The Government will perform an evaluation of the non-price factors to determine the best value to the Government. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award the contract without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to hold discussions. Offerors are encouraged to submit their best proposal from both a technical and price aspect, and not assume that the government will hold discussions. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer determines them to be necessary. However, during the evaluation process the Government may, solely at its discretion, communicate with an offeror for any purpose such as to gain a better understanding of the proposal. The Government need not communicate with all offerors. Rather, the Government may, at its discretion communicate with only some offerors or only one offeror. As a result of such communication, the Government may allow an offeror to submit a proposal revision. Government need not provide all offerors with an opportunity to submit a proposal revision. Rather, the Government may, at its discretion, permit only some offerors or only one offeror to submit a proposal revision. If proposal revisions are allowed from more than one offeror, the Government may, solely at its discretion, impose non-common due dates for the revisions. In other words, the Government may elect to have a proposal revision date for an Offeror that is different than a proposal revision date for another offeror(s). At any time prior to award, including upon receipt of proposals, the Government may exclude a proposal from further consideration for reasons such as, but not limited to, non-compliance with instructions related to this solicitation or the proposal is not likely to be selected for award.<br />NOTE: Statements that the Offeror understands, can, or will perform the requirements of the SOW without supporting information or narratives are inadequate. Offeror's are cautioned that simply "parroting" the SOW in their proposals will not be looked upon favorably by the evaluation panel and may result in an unfavorable rating. <br />Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government may make an award at a significantly higher overall price to achieve slightly superior technical features.</p>
<p><br />52-212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Security (Pass/Fail)<br />Factor 2 - Technical and Management <br />Factor 3 - Past Performance<br />Factor 4 - Price</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. <br /><br />Relative Order of Importance</p>
<p>Relative Order of Importance. The non-price factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>Factor 1 will be evaluated on a Pass/Fail basis. If an offeror does not receive a PASS for Factor 1, the proposal will be removed from consideration for award and will not be evaluated further. Factor 1 will not be considered in the price / non-price trade-off analysis.</p>
<p>The evaluation Factors 2 and 3 and sub-factors are ranked in descending order of importance. Factor 2 is significantly more important Factor 3. Sub-factor 2.1 is slightly more important than Sub-factor 2.2. The Past Performance factor will be evaluated independently from the other non-cost/price evaluation factor.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors. The rating for the evaluation Factor 2, Technical/Management factor will be based on the Government's determination of the degree to which the proposal satisfies the requirements of the factor. The highest possible rating is Outstanding, with the lowest possible rating being Unacceptable. The Past Performance evaluation factor assesses the degree of confidence the Government has in an offeror's ability to supply products and services that meet users' needs, based on a record of performance. The highest possible past performance confidence rating is Substantial Confidence with the lowest possible is No Confidence. The lack of relevant past performance information will result in an "Unknown Confidence" (Neutral) rating (i.e., neither favorable nor unfavorable Price does not receive a rating. <br />NON-PRICE EVALUATION FACTORS/SUB-FACTORS <br />Factor 1 - Security<br />The first volume that will be evaluated is Volume 1 - Security. The Offeror (proposed prime) must demonstrate that it possess a TOP SECRET facility clearance. The Offeror's provided CAGE code(s) will be verified with the Defense Security Service (DSS) database. The Security Factor will be evaluated with an adjectival rating of Pass or Fail. The definitions for the ratings are provided in Table 1 below.<br />Table 1 - Security<br />Rating Description<br />Pass The Offeror has a TOP SECRET facility clearance.<br />Fail The Offeror does not have a TOP SECRET facility clearance.<br /><br />NOTE: If the Offeror does not receive a Pass for Factor 1, the proposal will not be evaluated further and will be eliminated from consideration for award.<br />Factor 2 - Technical/Management <br />The Offeror shall describe, and the Government will evaluate, its operations and maintenance expertise of a modular document and media exploitation triage platform. The Offeror shall also describe, and the Government will evaluate, the Offeror's capability to perform research, development, testing, and evaluation of new technologies and tools related to documentation, media exploitation, and digital media triage as delineated in the Statement of Work. <br />a. Sub-factor 2.1 - Technical Approach: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's proposal to the extent to which the proposal:</p>
<p>i. demonstrates a clear understanding of the technical requirements of the Document and Media Exploitation (DOMEX) System SOW,<br />ii. indicates in-depth knowledge of system sustainment support to include development, engineering and enhancements to an existing digital forensics platform, and<br />iii. demonstrates depth and breadth of expertise to successfully perform the digital forensics platform and triage system research, development, testing and evaluation requirements.</p>
<p>b. Sub-factor 2.2 - Management Approach: The Government will evaluate the Offeror's security vetting procedures, and recruitment, hiring , and retention procedures to the extent to which the proposal:</p>
<p>i. demonstrates a robust internal security vetting procedures to ensure potential security issues are addressed before submitting proposed personnel security packages to NMEC for review by DIA security pursuant to the requirements in the SOW and Attachment A to the SOW.<br />ii. demonstrates evidence that the Offeror has robust procedures to recruit, hire, and retain qualified personnel that meet the requirements outlined in the SOW and Attachment D to the SOW.<br />iii. Demonstrates the Offeror's proposed Quality Control Plan provides evidence of an established and robust quality control structure and processes which are optimized to support the DOMEX Mission and provides succinct descriptions of management structure, tools, and procedures to be used to plan, monitor, control, and deliver required services.</p>
<p>The Technical/Management Factor will be evaluated with an adjectival rating. The highest possible rating is Outstanding, with the lowest possible rating being Unacceptable.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Past Performance<br />Relevancy <br />The Government will assess the Offeror's capability to perform the requirements of the contract by evaluating the past performance information, of either a prime contractor or a subcontractor, on previous or on-going contracts with similar scope to the SOW Support Areas. The estimated value will range from $7M -$12M. Only relevant past performance efforts completed within the last 36 months prior to proposal submission, or work that is on-going will be evaluated. <br />With respect to relevancy, more relevant past performance will typically be a stronger predictor of future success and have more influence on the past performance confidence assessment than past performance of lesser relevance. All past performance efforts rated as "Not Relevant" will not be evaluated for performance confidence assessment.<br />The lack of relevant past performance information will result in an "Unknown Confidence" (Neutral) rating (i.e., neither favorable nor unfavorable). <br />In conducting relevancy determination, the Government will assign a relevance rating for each past performance references using the rating definitions of "Relevant" or "Not Relevant". Only past performance references deemed "Relevant" will be considered as part of the Government's performance confidence assessment discussed below. <br />Performance Confidence Assessment<br />Confidence<br />The Government will review the relevant past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to the performance confidence assessment. The Government will review past performance in the areas of Schedule, Cost Control, and Performance <br />The Government may use additional information that is readily available to the Government including both the information received from Offerors, information contained in the Past Performance Questionnaires, and information obtained from other sources. During the evaluation of an Offeror's past performance, the Government may query the Government agency references provided by the offeror. Other sources may include interviews with program managers and contracting officers, available DoD and other agency past performance databases and available data from previous source selections or contractor capability assessments. <br />Offerors are reminded that both independent data and data provided by offerors in their proposals may be used to evaluate offeror past performance. The Government does not assume the duty to search for data to cure problems it finds in proposals. The Offeror bears the burden of demonstrating the quality of its past performance. Offerors may be asked to respond to adverse past performance information.<br />In conducting a performance confidence assessment, each Offeror shall be assigned a Performance Confidence Assessment. The highest possible past performance confidence rating is Substantial Confidence with the lowest possible is No Confidence. The lack of relevant past performance information will result in an "Unknown Confidence" (Neutral) rating (i.e., neither favorable nor unfavorable <br />Factor 4 - Price<br />The Government will make a determination to whether the price proposals submitted by Offerors are complete and the determination that a total price is reasonable. The reasonable determination will be based information submitted with the Offeror's proposal, comparison of other competitive offers, published labor rates, and the Independent Government Estimate. If required, other price analysis methods may be employed.</p>
<p>Unbalanced Pricing. Offerors are cautioned against submitting an offer that contains unbalanced pricing. Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable proposal, the price of one or more items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the application of price analysis techniques. The Government will analyze offers to determine whether they are unbalanced with respect to separately priced items. Offers that are determined to be unbalanced may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<p>Total estimated ceiling price to accomplish the requirement and all of its options will be used as a basis for evaluating price. The overall evaluated price will be the sum total of the Offeror's proposed base period and all option years plus six months after the last option period to allow for the possibility that the Government exercise the option at FAR 52.217-8. Offerors are specifically advised that, under this evaluation method, the Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the prices are unbalanced between initial and each option year. Each proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the government considers the proposed prices are not unbalanced, and are reasonable.</p>

PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Skopje, Macedonia<br />9. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR:</p>
<p>The Department of State's (DOS) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is the Bureau charged with foreign policy development relating to international crime, drug trafficking, corruption, criminal justice reform, post-conflict/civilian policing, and related issues. In Macedonia, and throughout the Balkans, INL supports criminal justice sector reforms and facilitates effective cross-border and regional law enforcement cooperation. In Macedonia, INL provides training, technical, and material support to police, prosecutors, and judges. INL has a wide array of partners in this effort, including other U.S. agencies, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and commercial providers.</p>
<p>Macedonia is a recipient of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE) funding. INCLE funding assists countries in their fight against transnational crime and illicit threats, including efforts against terrorist networks, the illegal drug trade, and other illicit enterprises. Embassy Skopje receives approximately $1.6M annually in INCLE funding for the following programs: a law enforcement capacity program, implemented by the Department of Justice's Office of International Criminal Investigative Training and Assistance Program (ICITAP) and a justice program aimed at advancing the rule of law and democratic principles. Macedonia, like every other candidate state for the European Union (EU), must demonstrate its capacity to fight organized crime and corruption and bolster public confidence in its justice sector institutions. INL's assistance programs are critical for achieving these goals.</p>
<p>After the formal adoption of the new Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) by the Macedonian Parliament on November 17, 2010, Macedonia began a substantial transformation of its criminal justice system from one that is inquisitorial to one that is more adversarial and closer to the U.S. system. The transformation entails dramatically changing the roles and responsibilities of the police, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges in Macedonia. The centerpiece of this new legislative framework is the adoption of a new CPC, which introduces new concepts into the criminal justice system: prosecutor-led investigations, greater defense rights and responsibilities to gather and challenge evidence, multiple special investigative techniques, direct and cross examination of witnesses, and trials in which the judge presides, rather than investigates.</p>
<p>INL programs in Macedonia have aimed to promote effective, efficient and transparent implementation of the CPC, which will streamline investigations and prosecutions, enhance interagency cooperation, and more effectively address organized crime, corruption, and political interference within Macedonian justice sector institutions. Implementation of this framework will promote greater accountability among justice sector institutions and actors, requiring extensive public outreach and significant monitoring and advocacy on the part of civil society and the media.</p>
<p>Based on recent political events in Macedonia, INL programs plan to focus assistance activity toward addressing both high-level and low-level corruption as a way to increase public confidence in the criminal justice sector. Special emphasis will be on capacity development within the law enforcement and justice sector to effectively investigate and prosecute corruption-related cases. Moreover, INL programs plan to help develop and reform criminal justice institutions that can independently fulfill their mandates, thereby developing sustainable institutions.</p>
<p>Purpose: <br />The purpose of this position is to provide a Legal Advisor to U.S. Embassy Skopje who will serve as the central role in implementing INL programming to support Macedonia's progress toward EU and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) membership. This program will be focused on developing the capacity of Macedonia to fight corruption and organized crime through mentoring and practical training for prosecutors and judges. The Advisor will also be expected to formulate innovative, targeted, and sustainable approaches for building the rule of law in Macedonia, to include proper implementation of the CPC.</p>
<p>The Advisor is responsible for in-country management of INL rule of law programs and ensuring that these programs are meeting expectations. The Advisor coordinates activities with the Deputy Chief of Mission, the rule of law political officer in country, and the INL Office of Europe and Asia (INL/EA) Program Officer in Washington, DC. The Advisor also works closely with the management section at Post to ensure proper execution of INL programming. INL seeks applicants with the requisite technical expertise, and a strong management background who are able to operate independently and work with limited resources.</p>
<p>Duties and Responsibilities<br />a. Serve as the Legal Advisor within INL/EA's assistance mission in Macedonia.</p>
<p>b. Provide policy analysis and program guidance to INL, Embassy Skopje, and other USG entities on effective mechanisms for, progress in, and impediments to, achieving reform objectives in Macedonia.</p>
<p>c. Manage, coordinate, and supervise all phases of INL rule of law programs in Macedonia, including sustainment upon completion of projects and supervision of local staff. The incumbent should be able to work independently and cooperatively with INL/EA to ensure that the program and administrative budgets are monitored routinely and that the projects fall within program guidelines notified to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>
<p>d. Implement INL rule of law program through training and mentoring. Serve as a trainer for INL-funded training programs. Provide mentoring and technical assistance to prosecutors on a range of issues, focusing on fighting corruption. Identify outside experts, when appropriate, to serve as trainers.</p>
<p>e. Ensure compliance with INL program management policies and procedures, which will include monitoring procurement and end use monitoring; and drafting program planning documents, such as work plans, budget plans, and monitoring and evaluation frameworks.</p>
<p>f. Establish and maintain relationships with Macedonian justice sector and other government officials, including prosecutors, investigators, judges, defense attorneys, civil society, parliamentarians, and other rule of law actors, to include the law enforcement sector. Ensure adequate follow up with study groups and training (train-the-trainer, alumni conferences).</p>
<p>g. Design and monitor assistance programs for the criminal justice sector utilizing a range of methodologies, such as conducting interviews and focus groups, as well as reviewing analytical reports. Ensure program activities develop local capacity. Activities should include a broad range of justice sector actors and there should be a strong emphasis on joint/collective training between different criminal justice groups (i.e. police- prosecutor workshops). Assist Macedonia in attaining EU accession goals by meeting EU benchmarks related to judicial reform and fair trials by hosting local workshops and practical case studies.</p>
<p>h. Coordinate with other implementers in the international donor community, including the European Commission, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and other donors. Maintain close collaboration with ICITAP, INL grantees, the Public Affairs Section, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).</p>
<p>i. Coordinate with local civil society organizations to develop an understanding of their challenges and needs, assessment of political developments in the country, as well as opportunities for INL support.</p>
<p>j. Focus on establishing guidelines, standard operating procedures, and public diplomacy tools to build alumni networks and develop mechanisms for linking Macedonian criminal justice actors with U.S. and European criminal justice professionals.</p>
<p>k. Provide mentoring on key anti-corruption concepts and tools to improve the justice system's capacity to address corruption. Advise Embassy Front Office and INL/EA on legislative developments impacting the criminal justice sector and share monthly and after-action reports for all discrete training and assistance activities conducted in accordance with the work plan. Assess the impact of political developments on U.S. policy objectives, make recommendations to the Country Team, and keep INL/EA updated on these developments. Develop legal memoranda and technical support on legal issues that may arise in connection with policy or program issues.</p>
<p>l. Cooperate with other sections of the Embassy and other regional INL-funded advisors to facilitate program implementation.</p>
<p>m. Represent INL in internal and external meetings, ceremonies, and representational events as required.</p>
<p>Relationships<br />The Advisor will receive guidance from the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) on program policies and priorities, and the INL/EA Program Officer on program implementation and INL bureau objectives.

<DESC>Amendment A01 serves to change the Pre-Proposal Meeting Time from 1:00 PM on January 5, 2016 to 2:00 PM on January 5, 2016.<br /><br /><br />The U. S. Postal Service plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to complete a Buildout project at the Brooklyn Times Plaza CAX located at 594 Dean Street, Brooklyn, NY 11238. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.
<p>The estimated cost range of the project is $1,300,000 to $1,500,000 with construction completion within 210 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification Statement and a Management Plan with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.<br />To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:<br />(1) Contractors must be licensed, as required by the State, to perform the work as stated in this solicitation.<br />(2) Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained. <br />(3) Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.<br />(4) Contractors must provide their EMR rating on insurance company letterhead. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification.<br />(5) Company must submit information for a minimum of three to five buildout projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as buildout projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $750,000 or more.</p>
<p>The Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated: experience/performance and capabilities. The price proposals for only the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is more concerned with making an award at the lowest overall price than with obtaining superior technical or management features. However, the Postal Service may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical or management features. The benefits of a higher priced proposal may merit a higher price. The evaluation factors outlined in Section 2-26.2, of the Supplying Principles and Practices, listed in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of proposals.</p>
<p>Prequalified contractors will be placed on a list for inclusion in future solicitations in this area with similar scopes of work. There is no guarantee that a specific number of solicitations will be issued to these prequalified contractors.</p>
<p>A PRE PROPOSAL MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE SITE ON January 5, 2016 at 1pm EST. ATTENDANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>The SOLICITATION PACKAGE is attached to this posting.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO Bob Ramba, Robert.c.ramba@usps.gov or Paige Lyne, Jacquelyn.p.lyne@usps.gov or Wendi Butterfoss, gwenda.b.butterfoss@usps.gov. Deadline for questions is noon on January 11, 2016.</p>
<p>There will be no public opening of offers. All proposal information received is CONFIDENTIAL until award of a contract. Upon award, the name of the successful offeror and the amount of the contract will be released as public information. The names of offerors and the amount of their offers will not be released as public information. This information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, Exception 4.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

______________________________________________________________________

This OFFICIAL synopsis/solicitation is for a firm-fixed-price multiple-award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) enterprise contract to satisfy an ongoing need at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) enterprise level to procure or lease Multifunctional Devices (MFDs).  This will fulfill VA's printing, copying, and scanning needs (including installation, configuration, training, and standard one-year commercial warranty support and maintenance) by offering eight unique MFD configurations for purchase or lease.  This acquisition is required in order to provide VA organizations with an efficient means of replacing and/or refreshing its MFD inventory that is at or approaching its end-of-life.  Establishment of a multiple-award ID/IQ enterprise vehicle will enable any VA organization to quickly and efficiently acquire current generation MFDs to meet its minimum MFD requirements.  

The IDIQ contract will consist of a single 2-year ordering period.  This will be a competitive acquisition and a 100% Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside.  VA intends to make up to three awards and reserves the right to make additional awards if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government.  

The NAICS code for this procurement is anticipated to be 334118.  The solicitation number assigned to this effort is VA118-16-R-0882 (previously issued as a Request For Information under ID# VA118-15-N-0225 and cancelled solicitation #VA118-15-R-0257 and VA118-15-R-0395).

The CHS-4 contract currently provides commercial hardware [i.e. Non-Developmental, modified commercial off the shelf (COTS) items (i.e. ruggedized and militarized)] and services for the procurement of total life cycle system management solutions in support of tactical programs by providing seamless and consolidated procurement of Commercial Information Technology (CommIT), customizable sustainment strategies, non-personal services and continuous technology upgrades for a variety of military organizations utilizing Firm Fixed Price and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (Term and Completion Type) Delivery and Task Orders issued against a single award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The CHS-4 five year ordering period will expire in August 2016 with the five year warranty period for the last possible item ending in August 2021. To fully appreciate the scope and magnitude of the follow-on CHS program, the following information is provided and should be considered when responding to this RFI: PdD CHS executes, on average, 125 delivery orders a year, procuring an average of approximately 60,000 items a year, at various ruggedization levels, all of which are configuration managed by the contractor. Items procured the most include: laptops, servers, routers, switches, storage appliances, OTCs, displays as well as associated cables, batteries, and UPSs. It should be noted that a majority of non-ancillary items are purchased with a 5 year warranty and that end users of this equipment are located across the United States, as well as most US Army OCONUS locations - to include active theaters of operations. <br /><br />Purpose: The Sources Sought Notice (SSN) posted on November 14, 2014 for Common Hardware System 5 contract focused on validating if competition existed. The responses received provided the Government insight into Industry's concerns and helped determine a path forward for PdD CHS strategy and assisted in refining the CHS 5 contract requirements. <br /><br />Instructions: The Government requests respondents revise their current submission to the SSN posted November 14, 2014 as well as provide feedback, comments, and questions regarding the revised draft PWS and Appendices with a specific focus on the additional Questions 1 - 7 below: <br /><br /><br />Q1.

Will you provide Level 3 Technical Drawing Package data rights to the Government to share on future purchases at no additional cost (cost above purchase and baseline services) in a single or multiple award environment? <br /><br />Q3. How would you provide configuration management data (equipment specifications), and to what detail level, to be available to competitors in a multiple award environment at no additional cost to the Government? <br /><br />Q4. How would you collaborate between competitors on related equipment to ensure compatibility, interoperability, form, fit and function at no additional cost to the Government? Provide examples of relevant past performance. <br /><br />Q5. Describe your ability to take advantage and leverage Army Enterprise License Agreements/Enterprise Service Agreements (ELAs/ESAs) for Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) warranty support, OTFWT and Out of Warranty (OOW) repairs; outside of any warranty provide by your company? <br /><br />Q6. What is your strategy for providing material at low cost to the Government over the entire 5 year contract? What Government incentives would reduce and minimize material cost? <br /><br />Q7. Describe your supportability strategy for Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) in the field (CONUS and OCONUS) down to box level and component level parts. <br /><br />Q8. What maximum hardware quantities are you capable of delivering within the designated ARO period for each hardware version listed in Table 1 - quote mark Maximum Period and Quantities to Ship After Receipt of Each Order quote mark - of the draft PWS?

The USGS requires instrumentation and personnel to collect high-resolution swath bathymetry mapping data for 23 days along the southeast Alaska continental shelf and slope in water depths between 100m and 2000m. The primary purpose of the work is to map and characterize the seafloor expression of the Queen Charlotte-Fairweather fault system to better constrain regional and transoceanic earthquake and tsunami hazards. The project requires continuous, high-quality coverage at approximately 10 m resolution, using a Reson SeaBat 7160 Survey System, a POS MV motion referencing unit, and expendable bathythermographs for sound velocity data. (See details below)

The contractor will provide two technicians, lead the mobilization and demobilization, provide and install a transducer pole mount, conduct an accurate patch test and system calibration, and perform all underway data acquisition and real-time QA/QC. All survey equipment will be provided and maintained throughout the survey in operational order by the contractor. 

The planned window of operations is May 1  June 25, 2016 and will take place on a contract vessel. The R/V Medeia (Alaska Department of Fish and Game) has been identified as appropriate and available. We are working towards securing the vessel through a cooperative agreement. A purchase request will be submitted as soon as funding is confirmed. 

Equipment and data Specifications

The final deliverables expected from the survey contractor are the following: 
1.	Reson SeaBat 7160 Survey System (minimum source frequency of 40 kHz)
2.	Pole mount for multibeam transducer/receiver compatible with contract vessel to be determined. Pole mount and motion referencing unit should be collocated
3.	POS MV motion referencing unit
4.	Raw, unprocessed multibeam data files
5.	Acoustic backscatter, snippets and water column backscatter data
6.	Motion corrected survey line files in a format compatible with CARIS HIPS and SIPS (i.e., s7k files)
7.	Preliminary gridded mosaic generated during real-time acquisition
8.	Any additional navigation/GPS data files generated during acquisition
9.	The POS-MV data recorded at 100Hz with the POSPac loging group packets selected.
10.	The Sound Velocity data with associated station location, time and/or underway navigation data
11.	Frequent data backup (e.g., twice per day)

For further information, interested parties may contact the Contracting Officer, Stewart Evans at (916) 278-9334 or sevans@usgs.gov.

<p>The selected 8 (a) firms will be required to perform at least 50 percent of the contract work with the prime's labor force in accordance with FAR Part 52.219-3.</p>
<p>3. SELECTION CRITERIA: Selection criteria for this acquisition are listed below in descending order of importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion), Criteria: Architects-Engineers primary criteria: items (f)-(h) are the secondary criteria and will only be used as "tie-breakers" among firms that are essentially technically equal.</p>
<p>(a) Specialized Experience and Technical Competence: Ensure that all special experience requirements are reflected on appropriate personnel resumes in Section E, Part I of the SF 330. The firm must demonstrate expertise in the following and must highlight the areas that meet these requirements so the reviewers can find that the requirements have been met:</p>
<p>(i) Recent experience, within the past five (5) years from the closing date of the synopsis, and significant/specialized experience in the design of new and existing military or military type facilities (for example a civilian motel is similar to a military barracks) and utility infrastructure and design of repairs, renovations and alterations of existing facilities and infrastructure at Military Installations paying particular attention to area architecture and conditions, utility systems, landscaping, interior design, value engineering and environmental issues. There must be a minimum of three (3) examples, of such recent experience showing specialized experience and technical competence in the design of Military type facilities with over $300,000 in design fees by your firm. The dollar value limitation will apply to cumulative past design experience within the past 5 years-not individual examples greater than $300,000. Specify the dollar amount of design/A-E Services actually performed by the firm on all the projects submitted. For example, if the firm performed $100k of mechanical design on a $2M project, submit the amount of design/A-E Services as $100k, not $2M. Failure to do so will cause rejection of the submittal. If the project is an IDIQ-show projects designed under the individual task orders. Do not just show an IDIQ as a project. The Government must see what the project actually consisted of. Military construction experience will be given more weight than military type construction projects.</p>
<p>(ii) Firms must demonstrate the capability to design projects to LEED certification criteria and to perform ASHRAE Level I, II &amp; III Energy Audits.</p>
<p>(iii) Firms must demonstrate at least five (5) years' experience, from the closing date of the synopsis, in Fire Protection and Life Safety Design in the use and application of NFPA codes 70 and 101. Experience with UFC 3-600-01, Design: Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities, which replaced MIL-HDBK 1008C, is also acceptable. It is insufficient to assert that the firm can meet these requirements. Show specific projects and list what codes they have been designed under. This applies to all of section 3 a requirements-show projects that meet the requirements and highlight how the requirements are met.</p>
<p>(iv) Firms must demonstrate experience in design and survey (including use of X-ray fluorescence devices) required for abatement of asbestos and lead-based paint.</p>
<p><br />(v) Firms must demonstrate past performance in preparing studies, design-build solicitations and design-bid-build solicitations, at Army and Air Force installations is preferred.</p>
<p>(vi) Firms must demonstrate the ability to prepare construction cost estimates, using the MII program, latest version, is preferred.</p>
<p>(b) Professional Qualifications: This Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) will require the A-E Contractor to demonstrate that all expertise requirements are reflected on key personnel resumes in section E, Part I of the SF330. When a minimum number of years/experience is listed, it is from the closing date of the synopsis.</p>
<p>Evaluation of each discipline will consider education, registration, relevant project experience within the last ten (10) years, and longevity with the firm. The asbestos/lead-based paint survey personnel shall demonstrate (listed experience on their resume) experience with x-ray fluorescent devices. Repeat Resume Page as needed to provide all required resumes.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the key personnel, minimum requirements and the minimum number required under this acquisition. These minimum requirements can be met utilizing in-house or consultants/subcontractors. Do not list a subcontractor as your firm's employee. This will be cause for rejection of the SF330.</p>
<p>(i) Two (2) Project Managers, minimum of five (5) years' experience, on vertical construction type projects, PMP certification highly desired. Saying an individual has for example ten years' experience without showing at least one project that was completed five years ago or longer will be cause for rejection of the submittal.</p>
<p>Three (3) registered Civil Engineers,<br />Three (3) registered Structural Engineers, <br />Three (3) registered Architects, <br />Three (3) registered Electrical Engineers, <br />Three (3) registered Mechanical Engineers, <br />Two (2) registered Environmental Engineers,<br />One (1) geotechnical Engineer,<br />One (1) certified Environmental Survey person (asbestos, lead-based paint, soil, etc),<br />One (1) environmental design person (asbestos, lead-based paint, soil, etc),<br />One (1) certified Cost Estimator with MII experience. <br />One (1) licensed professional Land Surveyor and one (1) survey crew</p>
<p>Each discipline shall have a minimum of five (5) years' experience in their field of expertise for all positions listed in this paragraph except for the survey crew. If the experience listed in the resume doesn't go back at least the five years that are required, the submittal will be rejected. Engineers and architects shall have a degree from an accredited university engineering or architectural program (ABET, NAAB). The cost estimator does not have to be a PE or registered architect. Cost estimator must be certified by AACE, Tri-Services, or any of the nationally recognized cost estimating certification organizations. Saying an individual has for example ten years' experience without showing at least one project that was completed five years ago or longer will be cause for rejection of the submittal.</p>
<p>(ii) One (1) qualified Fire Protection Engineer (A qualified fire protection engineer is defined as an individual meeting one of the following conditions: An engineer having a Bachelor of Science or Master of Science Degree in Fire Protection Engineering from an accredited university engineering program plus a minimum of five (5) years of work experience in fire protection engineering); or a registered professional engineer (P.E.) who has passed the fire protection written examination administered by the National Council of Examiners for Engineers and Surveys (NCEES); or a registered P.E. in a related engineering discipline with a minimum of five (5) years' experience dedicated to fire protection engineering that can be verified with documentation;</p>
<p>None of the required personnel can be dual disciplined, i.e. a separate employee must be provided for each stated requirement above to meet the number required. Ensure that resumes are provided for each of the required architects, engineers and other personnel specifically required. Resume for the licensed professional Land Surveyor is required. Resumes for the survey crew are not required.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance: Past performance on DoD contracts with respect to compliance with contract and task order terms, quality of work, adherence to schedules, cost control, communication, and issue resolution as determined by ACASS and Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS). The FAPIIS web site is https://www.ppirs.gov/. An ACASS report will be retrieved for the Joint Venture if proposer is a JV. If the JV doesn't have any ACASS ratings an ACASS report will be retrieved for each JV partner. ACASS reports will not be retrieved for the subcontractors that are proposed.</p>
<p>(d) Capacity: Firms must demonstrate adequate team capacity to concurrently complete the design of three (3) projects (total value of all three (3) projects at least $350,000) within a six month timeframe. The three (3) projects must be of the type listed in paragraph 2 above and for purposes of this criteria shall be presumed to be at three (3) separate locations, not within the same military installation or city.</p>
<p>(e) Knowledge of Locality: Firms must demonstrate familiarity with the SWD areas, primarily Texas, (by showing projects designed in these areas) and their applicable architecture, building codes, environmental regulations, soil conditions, seismic requirements and regulatory agencies.</p>
<p><br />The following items (f)-(h) are the secondary criteria:</p>
<p>(f) Volume of DoD contract awards: In Section H, Part I, SF 330, firms must show their past 12 months DoD contract awards stated in dollars (see details in subsequent paragraph 4(f)). Include awards to all branch offices.</p>
<p>(g) Geographic Proximity: Proximity is the physical location of a firm in relation to the location of a project. The primary geographic location of this contract is the Fort Worth District area of responsibility.</p>
<p>(h) Utilization of Small Business Firms: The extent of participation of SB, SDB, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU), and minority institutions (MI) will be measured as a percentage of the total anticipated contract effort, regardless of whether the SB, SDB, HBCU, or MI is a prime contractor, subcontractor, or a joint venture partner; the greater the participation, the greater the consideration.</p>

<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) is conducting market research to gather information on Information Technology (IT) services to help define the requirement and formulate an acquisition strategy that is appropriate for the Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) requirement. USTRANSCOM is seeking to identify interested sources that possess the capability to provide ITSM for USTRANSCOM IT systems and provide highly skilled IT professionals to help transform USTRANSCOM/J6 (TCJ6) to an Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) focused organization.</p>
<p>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This notice should not be construed as a commitment of any type by the Government to take or not take any action. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The scope of the ITSM effort is to provide a broad range of Command, Control, Communications, and Computer Systems (C4S) expertise to support the USTRANSCOM mission. IT technical skills will be required to support the USTRANSCOM C4 environment, which interface with numerous on-site and remote commercial, DOD, service, and common-user networks (i.e., Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), Non-secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET), and the Scott AFB Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN) or Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)). Additionally skills will be required to support a myriad of applications that make use of the USTRANSCOM C4 infrastructure by providing access and services to the USTRANSCOM user community.</p>
<p>Sources shall be knowledgeable of ITIL concepts, best practices in managing IT services through the lifecycle, policy and procedures, standards, and possess technical knowledge of managing IT infrastructure/networks to ensure interoperability with automated systems in DOD, and commercial industry partners.</p>
<p>Outputs may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, training and services. The majority of the work performed will support USTRANSCOM requirements with the remaining work effort supporting other DOD organizations including the Military Services, Defense Agencies, and their components.</p>
