<DESC><p>En-route Critical Care System (ECC) for use in Aeromedical Evacuation of Patients by the U.S. Air Force<br />Request for Information<br />THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. Any formal solicitations will be announced separately. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information provided in response to this RFI. <br />PURPOSE:<br />The 77th Aeronautical Systems Group at Brooks City-Base, TX is seeking information from sources that are capable of providing a portable En-route Critical Care unit which provides the following capabilities: (1) Ventilation, (2) Oxygen, (3) Fluid Resuscitation, (4) Physiologic Monitoring, (5) Hemodynamic Monitoring and Intervention, and (6) Flexible Power Utilization. <br />This unit must meet the following general criteria:
<p>&bull; Must weigh no more than 65 lbs<br />&bull; Must be able to operate and recharge on both alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) power sources from any US Military electrical power source, including both 12 and 28 volt direct current (DC) from ground vehicles and C130 electrical power (110/220 volts, 400 MHz frequency. <br />&bull; Must have a back-up power source that provides at least 4-hour autonomous operation<br /><br />An air worthiness certification ("safe to fly") will be required for the ECC unit. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the ECC will also be required for the ECC unit. Environment, Safety and Occupational Health (ESOH) and Human Systems Interface design will be a factor in evaluation of the ECC.<br />The small business size standard associated with NAICS code 315299 is 500 employees. All business sizes, to include small business and the sub-categories of small businesses, are being looked at during our market research phase.<br />BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION:<br />The fixed-wing AE environment poses unique challenges for patient care, mission equipment, and AE crews. High noise levels on some aircraft interfere with voice recognition, obscure audible signals and alarms on patient equipment, and increase crew fatigue during missions, which may last up to 16 hours (an augmented mission may extend beyond 24 hours). Vibration can damage medical equipment or impair stability and accuracy. Turbulence subjects the entire patient care environment to unpredictable G-forces, and requires mechanical systems that provide adequate security. Cabin air temperatures are not always well regulated as aircraft altitude changes and can vary by more than 40&ordm;F between deck level and a height of 60 inches above deck, creating challenges for care of patients susceptible to shock or suffering from circulatory problems. Relative humidity of cabin air is typically low, which may increase breathing difficulty for some patients.Existing medical equipment approved for use on aircraft does not fully meet the current mission demands for movement and clinical care of stabilized patients. Many items are too large, too heavy, or require excessive electrical power for patient loading and transport in ambulances and aircraft. Some medical equipment items are not certified for use on all aircraft. Loading and transport of critical care patients is cumbersome because unwieldy medical equipment does not fully exploit advances in miniaturization and wearable transducer technology. Existing equipment does not provide for in-flight telemedicine support or timely electronic transfer of patient care records to gaining medical units along the transport route. Communication must include voice/data between aircraft and ground nodes. All communications must be Net-centric compliant.</p>

<DESC>The 303 AESG/SYK plans to award a contractual modification on a solesource basis to acquire various communications and navigation assets in support of the German Euro Hawk, FMS Case to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation.  The USAF has an existing FMS contract with NGIS to provide Contractor Engineering Technical Services (CETS) under this case.  The German government requested sole source procurement of the CETS to NGIS, however, the subject assets were inadvertently left off of this sole source request.  This request, along with other international interoperability agreements, has the effect of requiring that the acquisition shall be from specified sources.  This effort will be awarded pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1 [10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)], only one responsible source has the unique capabilities/qualifications required to satisfy the governments needs.  Northrop Grumman is the only known firm with the knowledge, experience, and technical data required for the purchase, integration and sustainment of the Global Hawk and German variant Euro Hawk without substantial duplication of effort and cost to the government and delays in meeting the Air Forces FMS requirements. Any inquiries about subcontracting opportunities should be directed to Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation, 17066 Goldentop Rd, San Diego CA 92150-9066.  Communication concerning this notice should be directed to Chris Parsons, Contracting Officer, at (937) 255-7457.

<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT
In accordance with Section 3.2.1.2.1 of the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking highly specialized and skilled technical support to continue the development of the system-wide simulation model called the National Airspace System Performance Analysis Capability (NASPAC).  
The FAA is not liable for costs associated with a response to this informational announcement. This is not a solicitation announcement as no solicitation exists. This announcement is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any future solicitation.
PURPOSE
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing service to the Air Traffic Organization's (ATO-P) National Airspace System (NAS) Modeling Group with the continued development of a system-wide model. These sources must have experience and skills in air traffic management and simulations.  Sources are requested to submit detailed responses addressing each of the eleven areas of capability listed under the "Capabilities" paragraph below.
The FAA will consider the information provided from this survey in developing our acquisition strategy and also in considering the contract vehicle type regarding whether it should be full and open competition, limited competition, set-aside all or part of the procurement  for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program  or sole source procurement.
The principle North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this effort is 541330 (aerospace exception) with a size standard of $27.0 million.
BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF WORK SUMMARY
The FAA's NAS Modeling Group, a group within the Air Traffic Organization's NextGen and Operations Planning business unit, uses various models to analyze the overall performance of the NAS. These models are used to study the effects of proposed operational changes to the NAS on system-wide aircraft delay, throughput, and fuel consumption.  Such studies are usually performed as part of the cost/benefit analysis (or investment analysis) process.  These models may also be used to analyze the impact of adverse weather on NAS performance, or to study the effects of changes to user demand and/or fleet composition.  Users of these models will typically simulate an entire day of air traffic through the nation's airports and airspace, with adverse weather represented in some fashion, and estimate such metrics as gate delay, taxi-out delay, airborne delay, fuel consumption, etc.  
The primary system-wide model currently in use by the FAA is NASPAC, a discrete-event queuing model which incorporates airspace sector and airport queues. NASPAC can be considered a medium-fidelity model; as such, it can execute quickly, but has limited Traffic Flow Management (TFM) capabilities and a simplified representation of airspace capacity.
The FAA wishes to further develop the existing version of NASPAC and to ultimately replace the core simulation module.  The FAA will continue to exercise the model for analytical support of the NextGen project while the model is being developed. The model must therefore be developed in an evolutionary fashion, with updated software modules continually integrated into the production simulation.  The model should be developed using modern software languages and software development processes.  The model must be able to run on a single microcomputer using the Linux operating system, although the architecture should support parallel processing for Monte Carlo functionality.  One simulation of the entire NAS for one day, at current traffic levels, should execute in less than 15 minutes, with a goal of executing in 5 minutes or less.
This computer model will typically be used to simulate a full day of operations of the entire U.S. NAS.  The model must be capable of accommodating all Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) traffic, through both domestic and oceanic airspace, at current traffic levels.  The model must also be capable of accommodating future traffic levels to three times the current level.  Visual Flight Rules (VFR) traffic should also be accommodated at airports and in terminal areas, at a minimum.  The model must include a representation of taxi-way, runway, terminal area, en route sector, and oceanic airspace constraints.
SIZE AND INITIAL COST ESTIMATE 
The work that will be accomplished for system-wide modeling under this vehicle is still being evaluated by the Government.  It is anticipated that an award vehicle may have a total value of $9.5 million. This number is an initial estimate and will be revised as Agency requirements are established.
CAPABILITIES (RELATIVE TO THE SCOPE OF WORK- ATTACHED)

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with VG Scienta, Inc., of Newburyport, Massachusetts, for the acquisition of an upgrade for an existing VG Scienta High Energy X-ray Photoemission Chamber (HEXPS) currently being used in NISTs beamline laboratories at the National Synchrotron Light Source located at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

This requirement is for an upgrade for NISTs existing VG Scienta High Energy X-ray Photoemission Chamber (HEXPS).  The requirement consists of chamber and support frame upgrades.  

A major system is being developed on the X24A beamline operated by NIST at the National Synchrotron Light Source located at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.  This system will be comprised of NISTs existing Scienta High Energy X-ray Photoemission Chamber (HEXPS), bench with X/Y and motorized Z movement, solid state detector, load and lock system, and high energy R4000 analyzer.  This upgrade affects the HEXPS chamber portion of the system, and will allow the integration and optimization of the R4000 analyzer on the X24A beamline. 

Sole source justification is based on the fact that only VG Scienta can perform this upgrade in such a way as to allow full compatibility, integration, and optimization of the HEXPS chamber, the R4000 analyzer, and other system components to the beamline, as the upgrade technology and equipment both utilize design features that are proprietary to VG Scienta.  Upgrades purchased from any other vendor would not use this technology, and would compromise the desired accuracy in electron energy measurement and overall state of the art performance provided by the VG Scienta R4000 analyzer.  The accuracy of electron energy measurement is essential to deliver the materials characterization innovations planned for this system.

VG Scienta is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required upgrade for an existing VG Scienta High Energy X-ray Photoemission Chamber (HEXPS).  Sourcing this upgrade from any other vendor would require the replacement of the existing HEXPS chamber, the bench, the R4000 analyzer, and related components, incurring an unacceptable delay in the development of the beamline system as well as unnecessary duplication of costs.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, New York, 11973. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333314, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by will be considered by the Government.

*****Sole Source determination is based on the need for the required Thermoelectric Controller and Thermister to be compatible to an existing Infrared Collimator Calibrator.  Cables have been constructed by NIST to reduce electromagnetic interferences and a temperature stabilizer. The Controller and Thermister are manufactured to adhere to the specific Calibrators tolerances and are warranted by the Manufacturer.

2.	Offer/Quote Evaluation. After initial offers or quotes are evaluated as described in the Evaluation of Offers provisions of this solicitation, the Contracting Officer may proceed with the DPE process.

Revised price offers or quotes shall be electronically submitted by Offerors or Quoters during the DPE.

4.	Problems. Any offeror having problems during a DPE must notify the Contracting Office at FISC San Diego immediately.

No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the DPE from any of the participants; unless the Contracting Officer re-opens pricing discussions with all participants and requests final price proposals in accordance with FAR 15.307. 2.	No Automatic Award Determination. The Contracting Officer has determined that price is not the only factor to be considered when determining which Offeror shall receive the contract award. Therefore, the Offeror with the lowest price at the close of the Dynamic Pricing Event may not automatically be awarded the contract or purchase order that results from this solicitation.
3.	Notification of Unsuccessful Offeror(s). The Contracting Officer shall award a contract based on all the factors identified in this solicitation. The unsuccessful DPE participants will be sent a post-award notification, if required by FAR 15.503(b), via e-mail correspondence or the Procuri.com notification system.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate, intends to award a contract on a sole-source basis to continue developing and retool production of cell lines and master seeds for foot and mouth disease vaccine.. The authority for this sole source award is FAR 6.302-1 - there is only one source that can provide these services and products to DHS. The contract will be awarded to Genvec, Inc. of Gaithersburg, Maryland. Genvec is the only entity capable of performing these services because it created and owns the intellectually property associated with cell lines and master seeds upon which the vaccine will be based.  Development of a new cell line and master seed is not feasible and would result in the foot and mouth disease vaccine program being set back by years. The period of performance for this requirement is one year from the date of award plus three one-year option periods.  Anticipated deliverables under this contract include vaccines, augmented cell lines and master seeds, reports detailing production process streamlining, and CVB licensure. This notice is NOT a solicitation for proposals or quotations; however, any entity that believes it has the expertise, conforming data sets, and analysis methods to perform the required services is encouraged to submit a letter via e-mail to the Contracting Officer identifying their interest in the requirement and their capabilities. The determination to compete this procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>The Government intends to procure an award to Implementation Management Associates, Inc. (IMA). The purpose of this requirement is to obtain contractor change management resources to help the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) / Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) continue to effectively implement changes and process improvements across the enterprise. The scope of this requirement covers the tasks required to support the DITCO change management team, DITCO executive steering committee, champions, sponsors, project managers, and team members for changes being implemented across the entire directorate.
<p>Due to the critical stage of the development and implementation of significant changes within DISA/DITCO, it is imperative to the success of the organization's mission to continue its implementation efforts utilizing the unique and proprietary methodology developed and used by IMA. Another source would not be able to duplicate the proprietary methodology, training, and materials already developed and implemented by IMA within DISA/DITCO. Finally, award to any other source would cause undue delays to the schedule, significant duplication in cost and effort, and would negatively impact the organization's implementation efforts.</p>

<DESC><p>OFFADD: AFCA/ENNE, 203 W. Losey St, Rm. 2000, Scott AFB IL 62225-5222<br />SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />DESC: This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis. Information obtained as a result of this synopsis is for planning purposes only. It does not constitute an invitation for sealed bid or request for proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government. The government is currently conducting a market survey of products that can meet the requirements for an Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) discovery and assessment tool.
<p>The Air Force needs to determine the availability and maturity of software tools that can perform IPv6 discovery and readiness assessment. The Air Force has implemented manual processes to determine the IPv6 readiness of its network devices, but has interest in an automated tool that can perform the function to reduce workload.</p>
<p>Specific Requirements:<br />The tool must be able to scan the network and discover the devices connected to the network (e.g., routers, switches, hosts, servers, other network devices). The tool must be able to query those devices for their configuration information (e.g., manufacturer, model, operating system version, and configuration). The tool, at a minimum, must be able to gather information from network devices produced by 3COM, Cisco, Enterasys, Foundry, HP, Marconi, and Nortel.</p>
<p>Based on the response to the scan, the tool must generate a report detailing the IPv6 status of the discovered devices: IPv6 incapable, IPv6 upgradeable via software or hardware, IPv6 capable but not enabled, or IPv6 capable and enabled. The basis for IPv6 determination must be annotated in the report: Vendor literature, DoD IPv6 Approved Products List, IPv6 Logo Program, or other sources.</p>
<p>At a minimum, a vendor's RFI submission should answer the following questions:<br />1. How does the tool query the network devices, to include the ports and protocols used?<br />2. What device configuration requirements are needed?<br />3. Are there any requirements that cannot be met and why?<br />4. Does the vendor offer administrative/user support capabilities?<br />5. What are the expected cost breakdown (e.g., hardware, software, licenses, support desk).</p>
<p>Vendors responding to this RFI who currently can make solutions available to the USAF are requested to provide a description of capabilities NLT 30 days from publication of this notice. Potential vendors may express interest, make comments, and ask questions via electronic mail or fax to the Air Force Communications Agency, IPv6 Transition Management Office at Susan Ruffcorn afca.ipv6@us.af.mil or FAX (618) 229-5544. Vendors that meet USAF requirements will be allowed to schedule a demonstration, at no cost to the government, to highlight their solution's capabilities and provide software/concepts for USAF review. All comments and questions must be in writing and must identify the company source, contact person, e-mail address, and telephone number.<br />EMAILADD: afca.ipv6@us.af.mil<br />EMAILDESC: Air Force Communications Agency, IPv6 Transition Management Office, Scott AFB, IL</p>

<DESC>A. General Information:

In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), this request is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in the announcement. This is a Sources Sought regarding potential sources. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires Professional Services to provide consultation, advisory and project management services to Whole-genome sequence analysis of Salmonella enterica serovars commonly associated with foodborne outbreaks from processed foods, fresh-cut produce, and poultry.
 

The intent of this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement is to conduct market research to identify sources to support informed decisions to procure for the required services, i.e., a total small business set-aside action  (e.g., SBA Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran Owned, HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged, Veteran-Owned, Women-Owned,), GSA task order, etc. Our intention is to specifically identify small businesses. This notice is a Request for Information (SOURCES SOUGHT) for all interested qualified small businesses that meet the requirements for this effort.
The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541380 with a small business size standard of $5 million. This is not an invitation for bid, request for quote or other solicitation. 

B. Statement of Work Base Contract:
The contractor shall:

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, furnish the necessary personnel, services, and otherwise do all things necessary for, or incident to, the performance of the work. 

The contractor shall provide staff (contract staff) to be trained and capable of performing the tasks as described in this contract providing quality of work.  

Ensuring the American public that their food supply is safe to the consumer is a paramount mission of the US Food and Drug Administration. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, in conjunction with ORA, has the responsibility to provide the technology and methods for the analysis of foods. The emphasis of this contract is to focus on obtaining data that will reflect a broader scope of the frequency and levels of bacteriological human pathogens that have historically been associated with fresh produce commodities and a variety of ready-to-eat (RTE) foods.  Since the United States government has been advocating that the American public consume more fresh produce so Americans can lead longer and healthier lives, it is incumbent on all the players in this field, from the grower, processor, transporter, and grocer to the government agencies that provide an oversight on food production, to ensure that foods are safe to consume. This should apply to produce commodities grown and processed domestically and to imported foods as well, since the United States imports much of its food supply. All commodities that enter this country should also be devoid of any biological or chemical agent that can be deleterious to health.  Since the late 1990s, there have been an average of 16 foodborne outbreaks annually attributed to fresh produce. In many cases, the source of the outbreak is unknown; however, some, such as the recent Salmonella outbreak associated with jalapeno peppers, made national and international news. Although the Food and Drug Administration in 1998 (final guidance in 2007) issued its Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables (Good Agricultural Practices and Good Manufacturing Practices), the Agency has had to respond to several major produce-related outbreaks over the past few years.  The potential risks, from either zoonotic or human sources, to contamination with either a viral, protozoan or bacterial human pathogen can be traced to specific commodities, locations (domestic and imports), water sources and perhaps equipment used in processing and collection. For instance, examples of contaminated commodities include leafy greens (EHEC, Salmonella), tomatoes (Salmonella), green onions (HAV, Shigella), cantaloupe (Salmonella), parsley, cilantro, culantro (Salmonella, Shigella). 

In order to better understand how pervasive microbial pathogens are in fresh produce commodities the objective of this contract is to analyze selected foods for the presence of Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli O157:H7.  As for RTE foods, our focus will be on Listeria monocytogenes. Our plans include the generation of a database for these select produce as to the frequency of isolation/detection of the aforementioned pathogens in each commodity as it relates to its geographical location and growing season. 

The impact of such data collection could have an affect on any Produce Safety Regulatory Options Developed by FDA with the following parameters: Consistent across the U.S., based on sound science, overarching (most commonly consumed fresh produce), accommodate specifics (commodity, region, operations, practices, size of establishment), and allow the U.S. to meet its obligations under WTO SPS.

All data collected as part of this contract will be evaluated for potential posting at www.FoodRisk.org is an online information resource providing data, tools, and resources for risk analysis professionals.  The site is hosted by the Joint Institute for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (JIFSAN) which is a partnership between FDA and the University of Maryland.  FoodRisk.org has agreed to host the formatted data and make it available through the website.  Having the data of this study from surveying environmental and food samples in regard to the presence of Listeria monocytogenes  in RTEs, purchased from supermarkets data accessible through JIFSAN will help FDA and others refine existing food safety risk assessment models, build improved models, and develop appropriate consumer education and outreach campaigns.  FDA supports the need to reformat the data and make it widely available through the internet.
C. Project Background:

The US Food and Drug Administration and The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutritions (CFSAN) mission is to promote and protect the publics health by ensuring that the nations food supply is safe, wholesome, sanitary, and labeled in earnest. Ensuring the American public that their food supply is safe to consumers is a paramount mission of the US Food and Drug Administration. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, in conjunction with ORA, has the responsibility to develop, apply, and provide the necessary technology and methods for the effective screening, detection, and identification of foodborne pathogens from foods. This analysis often requires the application of facile molecular genetic methods in order to allow for a rapid and highly accurate genetic trace back of a foodborne pathogen to a particular food source, pathogen cluster, or locale. Such techniques often rely heavily on the genetic information provided from the genome-wide sequence analysis of these strains.  That is, the use of fully sequenced genome information often provides the starting point for identifying and applying unique genetic signatures in the form of SNPs (single nucleotide substitutions) for the differentiation and clustering of closely related pathogenic strains.  To this end, massive collaborative efforts are now in place between several genomic institutes which provide rapid throughput whole genome sequencing and federal and state public health laboratories which exploit the nascent sequence data to develop rapid subtyping methodologies based on SNP detection technology. As examples, several of these technologies include the Luminex SNP detection platform (Bio-Rad), Pyrosequencing (Corbett), and the IBIS T-5000 EIS-TOF SNP detection (IBIS) platforms. 

In recent times, numerous Salmonella serovars have been associated with a number of foodborne outbreaks in the U.S. Many of these outbreaks have come from Salmonella strains isolated from tomatoes, sprouts, cantaloupes, and derivative juices. Foodborne illness from Salmonella Newport, for example, has been associated with consumption of tomatoes cultivated on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.  In 2002 (512 cases), 2005 (71 cases), and 2006 (107 cases), S. Newport was found to have sickened consumers who ingested raw tomatoes from several Eastern shore farms.  The epidemiological complexity of Salmonella-induced outbreaks is manifold and includes: (i) potentially numerous natural reservoirs of Salmonella in the ecosystem, (ii) a lack of suspect isolates actually found on tomato, and (iii) a widely-dispersed area of affected individuals to name but a few aggravating circumstances. Salmonella, in general, appears to be a prominent and rising pathogen associated with produce and increased foodborne illness. In addition, Salmonella poses a substantial health risk since numerous strains appear to be resistant to at least one antibiotic with many strains displaying multi-drug resistant phenotypes. Salmonella has been shown to persist in certain niches for long periods of time.  For example, recent reports have demonstrated long-term survival of S. Newport in the gut of free-living nematodes.  Other studies have shown these serovars to be effective colonizers of living plant tissues that would help to account for the persistence of Salmonella on tomatoes and tomato plants. The ecological complexities of this recurrent contamination of tomato by Salmonella mandate the development of more effective and more sensitive DNA sequence-based subtyping methodologies.  These methods are important for more rapid and effective responses to these Salmonella-induced foodborne outbreaks as they should provide important information about the origins of an outbreak including the produce commodity, the geographic locales, and the genetic/epidemiological lineage of the Salmonella involved. 
This project is intended to provide CFSAN with a detailed nucleotide-sequence based survey of the complete genomic structure of a significant number of those current and specific Salmonella pathogens associated with produce-borne outbreaks of salmonellosis among the American public. Outbreaks due to the contamination of produce have received a heightened interest from the American public, public health agencies, and regulatory bodies. 

The first task order that will be issued will provide significant data on the specific DNA sequence-based genetic structures of several of the most common Salmonella strains to associated with human illness caused by the consumption of fresh produce. These data will facilitate the design of specific diagnostic tests for effective detection, identification, and differentiation of foodborne outbreak strains of Salmonella.  That is, the full-length genomic data harvested from this project will allow for the identification of effective nucleic-acid based targets for uniquely and unambiguously identifying a specific strain or serovar of Salmonella.  All data generated, including all of the raw nucleotide sequence files generated will be sent to the project officer and encompass a comprehensive genomic database of Salmonella pathogens within CFSAN that are commonly associated with foodborne outbreaks originating from fresh-cut produce and undercooked poultry and eggs.

<DESC>Pursuant to FAR Part 36, the USDA Forest Service Lake States Acquisition Team is updating qualifications data for Architect-Engineer (AE) contractors interested in doing work in northern Wisconsin and Michigan. The AE projects awarded under the short selection process will cost less than $100,000.

There are no known projects at this time; however, economic stimulus dollars are expected which may result in increased AE work. We are updating our pool of qualified, interested AE firms so that as projects are identified and funding is available we are positioned to utilize the short selection process to relatively quickly and efficiently obtain AE services.

This sources sought notice will be issued each year to annually update statement of qualifications and performance data.

AE firms are welcome to submit and update information at any time. Note: there are some restrictions (NAICS code and dollar amount dependent) on business size standards for eligibility. Additional information and instructions are posted electronically under solicitation number AG-569R-S-09-0011.

<DESC><p>This is a sources sought notice issued for market research purposes only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL.
<p>This Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA).<br />The purpose of this notice is to identify qualified l business concerns that are interested in and capable of performing the work and providing the products described herein. MSHA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought, MSHA may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). There is no solicitation available at this time. However, should such a requirement arise, no basis for claims against MSHA shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought or the MSHA's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.<br /><br />MSHA is the primary federal agency that enforces the Mine Act of 1977 with the mission of protecting the nation's miners. In the performance of that mission the Directorate of Education and Policy Development designs, develops, and conducts instruction programs with the latest technology available to assist in government, industry, and labor efforts to reduce injuries, illnesses, and fatalities in the mineral industries. To further this goal, MSHA has been exploring training tools involving Virtual Reality, Interactive Gaming, and 3 Dimensional technologies. This type of training will allow students to be immersed in a simulated mining environment and witness simulated hazards. This training will allow our entry level MSHA inspectors to mentally perform specific job inspection tasks while they are receiving guidance from instructors.</p>
<p>With this notice, MSHA is conducting market research to determine the types of commercial technical solutions that are available for the development of training courses based on interactive 3D virtual simulation of a mine.</p>
<p>The training environments will simulate a surface coal, surface metal, underground coal and underground metal. The surface mine simulation will include the following: Highwall, travelway, dump point, blast zone, heavy equipment, crushers, screeners, conveyors, etc. The underground mine will include: Standard room and pillar section, longwall section, working face, conveyor belt, heavy equipment, power center, etc.</p>
<p>Each environment will be equipped with a help interface that will include information from the MSHA mine file, accident reports, Federal Codes of Regulations 30, training records, along with other reference materials. The help interface will be available upon entering each environment and will be accessible throughout the training.</p>
<p>The course is to be completely interactive allowing the student to freely navigate through the 3D environment. Each environment should have different "game plays" or scenarios, each with a completely different set of mine violations. Each of these scenarios will have multiple decision points that will require the student inspector to choose if it is a violation, and the severity of the violation.</p>
<p>The event or inspection should have additional choices like a notes section where the student can take notes or take a picture of the scene. Upon completion of each scenario a report will be generated in the format used for MSHA citations with the information submitted by the student. There also may be a post inspection interview scenario after which they can choose to make changes to their citations before submission. These scenarios may also be customized for additional lessons with increased severity and possibly include a fatality, fire, emergency evacuation, highwall failure, mine explosion, or a mine rescue situation.</p>
<p>MSHA is currently developing SCORM compliant online training via Trivantis Course Mill Learning Management System a product that can manage the student courses and track their results. Responses should provide information regarding the possibility of making the product SCORM and Section 508 Compliant, as well as any options for online and stand alone delivery. All online delivery would be through MSHA's LMS or a government web server.</p>
<p>All interested parties are requested to respond to this notice by 12:00 Noon EST,. Wednesday March 4, 2009 to the contracting officer, Mr. Robert Beaty at beaty.robert@dol.gov. Responses to this sources sought notice should include a description of any product and its capability in the areas specified and the types of hardware platforms that are supported. Please include any experience in virtual reality 3D gaming technology development, mining background, and any information where they have developed similar products. The response should provide information including examples, of existing implementations using the product.. Additionally, please provide any catalog or pricing information on any existing system or product that you may have that would meet these requirements. As an aid to developing the Government cost estimate for this work we would ask that responses contain estimated costs for similarly developed products, maintenance and training or any catalog or list pricing for any existing product that would meet these requirements.</p>
<p>Any comments/questions must be sent to via email to the contracting officer ar beaty.robert@dol.gov. No questions or comments will be accepted by telephone.</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Information Requested:</strong></span></p>
<p>Media access to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Hurricane Center (NHC) is vital to public safety, especially when hurricanes threaten the United States. NHC has well-established guidelines and procedures for media access, including use of a "pool" arrangement to facilitate access by the electronic media when storms threaten the US and media interest is high. In 2008, hurricane Ike made landfall in Texas. NHC initiated the media pool, but very few stations used the media pool - at least in part because the existing technology supporting the pool arrangement requires the media to commit expensive assets (e.g. transportable satellite communications, establish a telco connection, or rent a local crew) to participate in the pool. As a result, citizens in Texas and elsewhere had more limited access to NHC expertise and forecasts than is the norm for other storms.</p>
<p>Accordingly, NOAA is seeking sources for technological solutions that will improve media access to NHC. Appropriate solutions must have the following characteristics:<br />1. Support broadcast quality (picture and audio) formats<br />2. Be accessible to any media company<br />3. Provide unedited NHC content<br />4. Fully comply with applicable NOAA information technology security requirements<br />In addition, the following factors will affect the feasibility / desirability of potential solutions:<br />5.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT, NOT A SOLICITATION OR OFFER TO PURCHASE. IT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES AND IS INFORMATIONAL ONLY. The National Park Service (NPS) Denver Service Center, 12795 W. Alameda Parkway, Denver, Colorado seeks to determine the availability and adequacy of potential SMALL BUSINESS, SERVICE DISABLED VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS, VETERAN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS, SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS, 8(A) SMALL BUSINESS, WOMEN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS, HUBZONE SMALL BUSINESS, AND OTHER BUSINESS SOURCES that may be able to provide experienced operators, engineers and support staff  to operate and maintain the Elwha water treatment plant (EWTP), Elwha surface water intake (ESWI), and maintain the grounds surrounding the facilities.   These facilities are located adjacent to each other and are next to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife fish rearing facility on the Elwha River west of Port Angeles in Clallam County, Washington, approximately 2 miles upstream from the mouth of the river.
The NAICS Code for this requirement is 221310 with a corresponding size standard of $7,000,000 gross receipts, averaged over the preceding 3 years. (The size of a small business firm includes all parents, subsidiaries, affiliates etc. see 13 CFR 121.103 and 13 CFR 121.108 All firms should be certified in ORCA https://orca.bpn.gov/ 4.1201 - Policy.)  In accordance with FAR clause 52.219-14, LIMITATIONS ON SUBCONTRACTING, at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.  This period of performance will be either a base year plus four one year options; or a multiyear contract covering five years of performance.  The estimated dollar value is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 for the entire 5 years period.
The EWTP site is designed to treat water from the ESWI for use in industrial and fisheries applications by removing suspended sediments.  Operation of the EWTP will be required to satisfy daily demands of the City of Port Angeles and the Nippon Paper Industries Mill.  The plant is designed for a maximum treated water capacity of 37,000 GPM.  EWTP consists of an influent pump station, influent/chemical mix tanks, sedimentation tanks, chemical feed and storage building, effluent flow distribution structure, slurry pump stations, office/laboratory building and associated pipelines. The plant will be operated during periods of high sediment release resulting from the future removal of Elwha Dam and Glines Canyon Dam.  The ESWI includes a concrete control weir, intake structure, supplemental diversion pump structure, fish screen structure; tunnel; piping; electrical; mechanical; utilities and site work.  Mechanical systems include numerous control gates and valves, as well as fish screen cleaning equipment. The electrical system will include a standby generator and SCADA control for monitoring and operating project equipment. Most of the equipment will have several modes of operation: manual, automated, and remote.Operation and maintenance of the Elwha Water Treatment Plant -   The operator will participate in the initial startup of EWTP, anticipated in October 2009.  The plant will then be shut down until sediment is released during the dam removal which is undetermined at this time.  Operation of the plant may be periodic, depending on actual sediment releases.  The operator will maintain the plant equipment during the shutdown period(s) and provide startup and shutdown as conditions dictate.  During periods when sediment content exceeds the requirements, the contractor will provide all plant operations necessary to supply water quality meeting existing agreements with the water users.  The contractor will also provide periodic inspection and maintenance of the Area Flood Protection Levee, including cleaning of culverts, maintenance of riprap, vegetation removal, and other items required by the Army Corps of Engineers maintenance plan.  In addition, all cleaning services, grounds maintenance and snow removal of the all facilities and all portions of the project site is required.  Operation and maintenance of the Elwha Surface Water Intake Structure - Services include 24/7 operation and maintenance of the fish screen structure, all piping, and mechanical and electrical systems to guarantee water delivery to users.  Water delivery must be continuous and cannot be interrupted.  
 Firms responding to this notice must identify their abilities in a narrative format.  Information should include whether or not they are a Small Business, certified HUBZone Small Business, certified 8(a) Small Business, certified Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-owned Small Business Veteran-owned Small Business, or Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business.  Information should also be included that shows the firm has prior experience operating and maintaining water treatment plants and intake structures;  has operators and engineers with experience operating these  facilities; and has experience delivering water to end users.  The information received as a result of this market research will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement on a full and open basis or as a set aside under one of the SBA's small business programs. The NPS does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis for the purpose of conducting market research, and obtaining industry information ONLY.  No proposals are being requested, nor accepted at this time.  The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications from members of both large and small business concerns, including 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB).  The National Park Service (NPS), Intermountain Region, Santa Fe Major Acquisition Buying Office (Santa Fe MABO), will use information obtained through this synopsis to develop an acquisition strategy for the replacement, restoration and / or modernization of existing facilities and infrastructure, or the construction of new facilities and infrastructure, through the use of Simplified Acquisition of Basic Engineering Requirements contracts (SABER).  SABER is an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for real property maintenance, repair, remodel, alteration, and minor construction projects to include building, industrial, and commercial work
The NPS, Santa Fe MABO intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to award a SABER contract(s), for construction, maintenance, and repair at NPS units and locations throughout the western half of the state of Texas.  Typical work under SABER will include, but will not be limited to minimal design services, construction of facilities, interior and exterior facility renovations, heating and air-conditioning, HVAC controls, plumbing, fire suppression, interior and exterior electrical and lighting, fire and intrusion alarms, communications, limited utilities, site-work, landscaping, fencing, masonry, roofing, concrete, asphalt paving, storm drainage, limited environmental remediation, surveys, studies, and other related work.  The contractor shall be responsible furnishing all materials, labor, plant, tools, transportation, equipment, services and incidentals necessary to complete each delivery order from conception through completion. The contractor shall be capable of performing multiple simultaneous projects.  All work will be accomplished in accordance with individual task order requirements, master specifications, contractor developed construction drawings, and a detailed estimate developed using contract specific cost estimating software and unit price databases.  
Based on the results of our market research, and interest demonstrated by responses to this synopsis, our ultimate goal is award of a SABER contract(s) to a single business type classification, or to a mix yet to be determined, of 8a, HUBZone, SBD, SDVOSB, and large / small business concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), code(s) for SABER will be 236220 and 237990. The small business size standard will be $33.5 million average annual revenue for the previous three years. 
Total contract period for SABER, to include all options, shall not exceed five (5) calendar years. Delivery Orders will range in value from $10,000.00 to $500,000.00. The total of individual task orders placed against a SABER shall not exceed $20,000,000.00 to any one contractor.  The selection process will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Source Selection Procedures.  Proposals will be evaluated on Past Performance, Technical, and Price Evaluation of a Prototypical Project.  Prospective offerors will be required to submit a written past performance and technical proposal and a price proposal for the prototypical project to be considered for award. The prototypical project will be used to evaluate the offeror's price and technical proposals. 
For the purposes of this Sources Sought Synopsis, the NPS is requesting that interested businesses furnish the following information: (1) Company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and email address. (2) Business type classification, 8a, HUBZone, SBD, SDVOSB, large / small business etc., (3) Provide a general statement of your qualifications, capabilities and demonstrate the capacity to perform this type of work, (4) Demonstrate experience and technical competence in the execution of construction projects, in the dollar value range of $10,000.00 too $500,000.00.  Also, provide a brief description of example projects / work performed, contract number, total contract value, and period of performance for the selected examples.  Contracts must be the same or similar to the work described in this announcement.  (6) Responders, including joint ventures, should demonstrate that they have the capacity to perform all aspects of the types of work described in this synopsis, either by their in-house capabilities or through their subcontractor's capabilities.  Existing and potential Joint-Ventures, Mentor / Protg, and teaming arrangements are acceptable and encouraged.

In order to determine the best metal nanoparticle and theoretical enhancement attainable with a specified fluorophore the subcontractor shall use the most applicable method (e.g., discrete dipole approximation (DDA) or finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)) to calculate the best atomic metal, and particle shape and size for optimal enhancement of fluorescence in a medium specified by NSTec. Since it is understood that the optimal structure may not be the most practical for synthesis, simulations shall also be performed for metal particles with size and shape deemed appropriate based on the prior calculations. An estimate of the electromagnetic field enhancement with distance &ldquo;d&rdquo; from the metal particles should also be reported for both optimally sized and shaped metal nanoparticles (MNPs), and for MNPs which can be synthesized using the calculations as a guide. The far-field optical cross-section of the metal particles shall also be calculated.</span></span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: small;">The subcontractor must have significant expertise in performing calculations to predict the near-field interactions between fluorophores and metals using Mie theory, discrete dipole approximation (DDA) and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods. The subcontractor must be an expert in the field of metal enhanced fluorescence (MEF) as exemplified by a strong record of publications in the field. The subcontractor must have facilities and expertise which permit design and fabrication of appropriately sized and shaped metal nanoparticles (with a protective coating of appropriate thickness) and the subcontractor must also be able to characterize the metal nanoparticle-fluorophore system. </span></span></p>

This effort will include the development and implementation of regulations and guidance; the development and support of voluntary partnerships and programs; the evaluation and characterization of radiation sources and their disposition through the environment; the development of guidance and site-specific analyses associated with remediation; the evaluation of innovative technologies, and the provision of reliable public information on issues related to radiation protection.
To provide this support, the Contractor shall be familiar with all significant Agency policies/practices and guidance and be able to prepare documents and deliverables that meet "plain English" requirements.  The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, equipment, hardware and software, services, and facilities to perform any work as specified in work assignments.  The major program areas of this requirement include (1) Radioactive Waste Disposal and Management (e.g., WIPP, Yucca Mountain, TENORM, Low Activity Waste, clean materials, disposal of waste from weapons of mass destruction); (2) Cleanup (e.g., radioactively contaminated sites, federal guidance, technology assessment, risk modeling); (3) Air Toxics [e.g., NESHAPs (National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants)]; and (4) related areas (e.g., modeling, risk assessment, risk harmonization, Toxics Release Inventory, radiation information management). 
A detailed Draft Statement of Work of this requirement can be found on the EPA website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  Any offeror interested in this requirement must demonstrate the firm's ability to successfully perform the requirements of the  Statement of Work.  
The firms should focus on such factors as sound technical approach, sound technical results, choice of subcontractors/consultants, attention to detail, presentation format, effective administrative information gathering techniques, and sharing within the management process; and demonstrate the magnitude and breadth of capabilities/experience of the personnel and subcontractor/consultant resources that your company will employ to accomplish work under this requirement. Additionally, interested offerors should demonstrate their capability to ensure deliverable product quality and to plan, develop, implement, manage, and assess the effectiveness of quality control and quality assurance plans and operations.  EPA reserves the right to set this action aside for small businesses. 


The applicable NAICS Code is 541620 with a size standard of $7 million in average annual receipts over the preceding three years.  It is anticipated that a cost plus fixed fee/level-of-effort/work assignment type contract will result from the award of this solicitation.  The anticipated period of performance is a total of five (5) years, with a base period and four optional periods of 12-months each.  The Government anticipates a total level-of-effort of 75,000 direct labor hours consisting of 15,000 labor hours for the base and subsequent periods.  In addition, the contract will allow for 37,500 optional labor hours.  This will include 7,500 for the base year and each subsequent option period.  It is anticipated that this solicitation will be issued on or around 03/25/09 and that proposals will be due approximately 30 days after issuance.   
This notice will be amended to indicate whether this action will be set-aside for small businesses or be processed under full and open competition.

<p>USSOCOM's procurement strategy is to award a research and development effort with a Firm Fixed Price multiple year production option to one or multiple vendors possessing a mature prototype.&nbsp; Both the research&nbsp;and development effort and production option will be competed simultaneously.&nbsp; USSOCOM intends to conduct integration, verification testing, and prototype refinement of a mature prototype.&nbsp; A mature prototype for this requirement is defined as a vehicle that has been demonstrated in an operational environment or Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7 or greater.&nbsp; Results will be used to determine which offer is the best value for the Government and down select to conduct low rate initial production.&nbsp; Attached is the draft specification which is being provided for industry comment.&nbsp; USSOCOM will accept responses from industry which directly comment on the content of the draft acquisition document.</p>
<p>The intent of this synopsis is two fold:</p>
<p>First, USSOCOM is specifically interested in industry comments related to the alignment of the draft document with current industry capabilities.&nbsp; USSOCOM is pulsing industry and seeking input such as, does industry agree this type of requirement can be largely met with an existing, mature prototype vehicle.&nbsp; If no, then please comment which sections of the draft specification are potentially not attainable with current technologies and limited prototype refinement.</p>
<p>Second, Firms interested and capable of supplying this product should provide the following information: company name, cage code, address, phone number, email address, a point of contact, and type of company within NAICS 336112.&nbsp; Also, contractors shall provide specific product literature as it pertains to the draft specifications; complete vehicle specification sheet; estimated price; and quantity and delivery capability.&nbsp; Please include any results of relevant testing, evaluations, and/or certifications that have been completed on the proposed vehicle.&nbsp; General company product literature will not be considered a response.&nbsp; Information shall be submitted to Leatrice Frederick at <a href="mailto:frederl@socom.mil">frederl@socom.mil</a>&nbsp;or faxed to 813.826.7504, no later than 1200 EDT on March 20, 2009.</p>
<p>This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.&nbsp; This notice shall not be constructed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.&nbsp; No entitlement to payment will arise as a result of the submission of contractor information.&nbsp; No other program information related to total dollars available, total quantity of vehicles authorized, or timeline for official solicitation is available at this time.&nbsp; USSOCOM will post that information in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to FedBizOps after finalization of the acquisition documents.</p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
The following is a Request for Information (RFI).  No solicitation document exists.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Responses to the RFI cannot be accepted by the Marine Corps to form a binding contract. 
The Expeditionary Command and Control Suite (ECCS) is a transit case/suitcase based communications solution that provides Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) and Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) email and web access, secure voice, secure Video Teleconferencing (VTC), Command and Control Personal Computer (C2PC), Common Operational Picture (COP), and the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) standard collaborative planning tools.  This system and the services it provides are required by initial response teams to facilitate communications with higher headquarters while on-the-pause and over-the-horizon, until larger Command and Control (C2) systems are established.  The ECCS will allow early entry forces to rapidly move into theater and conduct en-route collaborative planning while providing reach back into the Global Information Grid (GIG).
The ECCS system architecture is comprised of base stations and scalable deployable communication solutions.  A base station consists of the equipment necessary to terminate these systems.  Four variants of the deployable system are required:  the Rapid Response Kit (RRK), the Commander's Kit (CK), and the Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) variants of the RRK and CK.  
The Marine Corps System Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is issuing this RFI to identify potential business sources under NAICS code 517919 that are interested in being a prime contactor to provide ECCS units, system sustainment and capability improvements for the continued integration of state-of-the-market hardware and software for the ECCS.  The company will provide ECCS production, sustainment, systems engineering, integration, fielding and logistics support to provide communications capabilities with ECCS and services to the Marine Corps.  Sustainment will include 24 hour, 7 days a week helpdesk operation, routine software maintenance and obsolescence management.  Support will include fielding, (field level and depot level) maintenance of hardware and software, training, engineering services and technical support.  The Government anticipates entering into an IDIQ Fixed Price contract with a five year ordering period.  The Government's anticipated minimum and maximum ordering amou! nts are $2,000,000 and $75,000,000, respectively.
The Marine Corps Systems Command will use the results of this RFI to determine which businesses in the marketplace are capable of fulfilling the Government's requirements (outlined above) as a prime contractor.
Interested businesses are requested to submit a capability statement, not to exceed 5 pages, outlining their ability to meet or exceed this potential requirement no later than 4:00 pm EST, 11 March 2009.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 517919, All Other Telecommunications, Size $25,000,000. 
Information contained in the capability statement should be pertinent and specific to the Government's requirement, and at a minimum address the following qualifications: (1) Experience: An outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed; (2) Facilities: Availability and description of facilities location and availability to support performance; (3) Security:  A statement regarding personnel and facility security clearance; (4) Business size:  Include the company's business size based upon NAICS code 517919; (5) Contact:  Identify a corporate point of contact; (6) CAGE code:  Include the company's CAGE code; and (7) Interest level:  Include an affirmative statement that they are a [indicate large or small] business and interested in performing as a prime contractor.  (This RFI is not seeking to identify subcontractors or match subcontractors with prime contractors).  Include any other specific and pertinent information as it pertains to th! e particular supplies to enhance our consideration and evaluation of your company's capability to meet the requirement.
Electronic submissions are preferred.  Interested sources should send all capability statements via email to chris.enos@usmc.mil.  Hard copy submissions may be sent to: Commander, Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: PG-12 CT027, Chris Enos, 2200 Lester Street, Quantico, VA 22134.  THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.
MARCORSYSCOM will not pay or provide reimbursement for any costs incurred in the preparation or delivery of the request for information.

<DESC><p>Proposed addition of Tape, Painters and Tape, Duct to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<p>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Tape, Painters and Tape, Duct by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.</p>
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the broad Government requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p><br />7510-00-NIB-0910 Blue. 1X60yd. 5.7mil. Premium Painters Tape. Acrylic adhesive. Crepe<br />backing.</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0860 Blue. 1.5X60yd. 5.7mil. Premium Painters Tape. Acrylic adhesive. Crepe<br />backing.</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0911 Blue. 2X60yd. 5.7mil. Premium Painters Tape. Acrylic adhesive. Crepe <br />backing.</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0859 Blue. 2X60yd. 9mil. Industrial Strength. High tack adhesive. Polycoated.</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0858 Yellow. 2X60yd. 9mil. Industrial Strength. High tack adhesive. <br />Polycoated.</p>
<p>The contracting agency involved is the GSA, New York, NY<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Tape, Painters and Tape, Duct to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>
<p>7510-00-NIB-0910 MMM 2090-1A (772461)<br />SHU 202872 (CP27-1)<br />UNV PT14024<br />MMM 2090-1A-4X<br />DUC 00-05128-03<br />Interstate Polymer Group 9531</p>

<p><br />In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing Tape, Painters and Tape, Duct to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 4, 2009 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>
<p>When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51. Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov. If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Identifying Performance Measures and Service Levels for Government Service Delivery
 
Contracting Office Address
General Services Administration, Office of Citizen Services and Communication, Office of Business Management (XB),  1800 F Street, NW,  Room 7010, Washington, DC 20405

Description
GSAs Office of Citizen Services (OCS) currently provides service to citizens through the Internet at USA.gov, GobiernoUSA.gov and a family of consumer websites, through the phone at the National Contact Center (1 (800) FED INFO), and through the distribution of print publications from the center in Pueblo, Colorado.  In addition, OCS communicates with the public through email, an online blog at http://www.govgab.gov, and online personal assistance (webchat).  To ensure that we are meeting the needs of the public and our fellow agencies, we continuously review existing research on many topics including population trends, use of online services, the digital divide, customer satisfaction, and whats top on Americans minds through their access and searches on USA.gov.  In addition, OCS sponsors communities of interest and conducts its own research all of which can be found at http://www.usaservices.gov.  In 2005, OCS published the result of an interagency study of service levels in government.  However, much has changed in government and society since 2005 and we feel that additional research is needed.  This is especially true in the current Web 2.0 environment where citizens, particularly in Generation X and Y, have different communication and collaboration styles and needs. Since citizens expect their government experience to be on par with those they have with the private sector, it is crucial to determine how best the government can serve citizens in a world with rapidly changing technologies.  

In addition, OCS assists other agencies with improving their delivery of information and services.  OCS also interacts with other governments at the state and local levels.  OCS plans to collaborate with other agencies and governments in the development of a new set of recommended performance measures and service levels. Our goal is to ensure that government service delivery is, minimally, on par with the quality of private sector service.

Objectives
In order to improve the service that federal, state and local governments provide to citizens online and through other service delivery channels such as phone, email, print, and emerging technologies such as social media, OCS will sponsor an intergovernmental committee to investigate, review and come to consensus on the best performance measures and service levels that agencies should adopt at points of contact with citizens and other government customers.  The baseline for our project is our previous report Citizen Service Levels Interagency Committee (CSLIC) Report.  Found at: http://www.usaservices.gov/pdfs/performreport.pdf.

Vendors Role 
It is anticipated that OCS will procure current; (published no later than January 2007) EXISTING research reports on performance measures and service levels for both private sector and public sector customer interactions.   Please review the CSLIC report mentioned above to understand the type of measures we looked at in the past.  We wish to include those from the CSLIC report and to add to them depending on what we learn from available research. 

Instructions
The Government is seeking responses from qualified vendors whose EXISTING, and current, research publications/reports address some of the following questions.  In the subject areas below we use the phrase best practices and best measures to mean that WE ARE LOOKING FOR BOTH the type of measure (metric), such as Time on hold AND the quantified measure such as 45 seconds.

<DESC>This is a SPECIAL NOTICE to communicate TSAs intent to award a firm fixed price contract to COSTAR Group, Inc., 2 Bethesda Metro Center, 10th Floor, Bethesda, MD 20814 on a sole source basis, for the purchase of commercial real estate database site license subscriptions.  This is a continuing requirement and follow-on effort.  The period of performance will be a total of five (5) years; one 12-month base period with four 12-month option periods.

In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, there is no other existing entity that offers the services comparable to COSTAR which are necessary to successfully meet TSAs commercial real estate search and analysis needs. 

The Transportation Security Administration was created in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 as part of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act signed into law by President George W. Bush on November 19, 2001. Pursuant to that law 107-71 114(j)(1), TSA has the authority to acquire (by purchase, lease, condemnation or otherwise) and lease real property within and outside the Continental United States, as necessary.  

The Office of Real Estate Services (ORES) is responsible for all TSA real property.  COSTAR allows ORES to search accurate and up to date commercial property information.  The site licenses provide access to a database that features over 38.5 billion square feet of property in over 300 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and has the ability to cross reference and cross analyze a market; research building characteristics; and includes photographs, floor plans and virtual tours.

No effort will be made to solicit from potential sources as there is only one possible source.  No actions will be taken to increase competition; however this requirement will be reviewed upon renewal for potential sources that may enter the marketplace.

The purchase will be awarded without further notice on February 27, 2009.

If a solicitation contains PPIRS-SR provisions, source selection officials will use data obtained from PPIRS-SR as part of the performance risk assessment in accordance with the evaluation criteria in section M of that solicitation. <BR><BR>Contractors are granted access to PPIRS-SR to view their current scores and any pending classifications.  Pending classifications are held in a review status for 30 days to allow for contractor review.  PPIRS-SR allows contractors an opportunity to challenge any quality/delivery performance record.  It is the contractors responsibility to review the data in PPIRS-SR and make any appropriate challenges to that data.  The database is updated once a month.  <BR><BR>To learn more about PPIRS-SR, register your firm in PPIRS-SR and review your past performance data. (Any contractor can register to see what data PPIRS-SR contains.)  To submit challenges, go to the following web site http://www.ppirs.gov. <BR><BR>Questions should be directed to Robert Brown, 309.782.3501, or email robert.brown16@us.army.mil .<BR><BR>*Use of NAICS codes to be determined. <BR>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement contains the written solicitation, and quotes are being requested. The 319th Contracting Squadron at Grand Forks AFB, ND intends to purchase the Professional DynaMetric Programs Platinum Plan&reg; behavioral assessment tool. This purchase is Brand Name approved. PDP's Platinum Plan includes 5,000 surveys, web access to the company's database, job models, and team reports.

The contractor shall also be responsible for the training and certification for 10 individuals at Grand Forks AFB, ND and provide 10 Facilitator's Guides.<br />The Contractor shall also provide 200 PDPWorks&reg; Application Workbooks:<br />75 ea Developing Effective Communiciation Skills.<br />63 ea Strengthening Leadership Peformance.<br />62 ea Developing High Performance Teams.<br />Quote should also contain transportation and per diem costs.
<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR BRAND NAME PURCHASE:<br />The PDPWorks&reg; assessment tool is the only software suite that meets the agency's need. The 319th ARW purchased 500 PDP&reg; Platinum surveys at the end of FY08. These surveys cost the 319th ARW $7,988.00. Over 450 man hours in the past four months were spent training on the PDP for both individuals and organizations system equating to $3,789.40.

C.  Provision/Clauses

The provision at FAR 52.212-1  Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, and FAR 51.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications  Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition.  Quoters are advised to include, as specified in item II.  3 above, a complete copy of the provisions at 52.212-3 with this offer.

For 52.212-2, Evaluation- The Government will award a contract resulting from this        
solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most    
advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The Government  
reserves the right to award the Task Order to other than the offeror with the lowest price.  
The evaluation of quotes will be based upon a complete assessment of the offerors quote.  
The factors will be evaluated as described below on a greatest value basis.  Selection will be 
determined on the basis of the following:

1)	how well a proposal satisfies the evaluation criteria below;

2)	the strengths, weaknesses and risks a quote presents to the Government and

3)	evaluation of the quotes relative to the proposed prices of the offerors.


Basis for Award:  The award will be made to the offeror whose quote/proposal contains the combination of criteria offering the best overall value to the government in accordance with FAR Part 12.  This will be determined by comparing differences in the value of the technical features with the differences in the offerors prices.  In making this comparison, the government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall price.  The criteria are presented in descending order of importance.  These should be related to the requirements in the Statement of Work.  The factors are identified as 1 through 3.  Factors 1 through 3 have sub criteria under them.  All sub-criteria are of equal importance.  The Government may make award without conducting discussions.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

1.	Factor: Past Performance

The offeror is to identify past or current contracts for performance similar to that described in the request for quotation.  The offeror is to identify at least one contract that it has performed work similar to that described in the request for quote.  

Provide length of experience by providing a list of work experiences along with correspondence reference information (client name, address, and telephone numbers of the primary point of contact, a brief description of service provided and period of performance).

2.	Qualifications

The offeror shall provide qualifications of its key personnel that clearly describe the skills, knowledge, and ability for performing the services required by the contract.  Individuals must be of unquestionable integrity and display a mature attitude and exercise good judgment.

3.	Plan of Accomplishment

The offeror shall provide information demonstrating its understanding of the contract requirements and explain its approach for successful performance as well as demonstrate an ability to meet the performance requirement set forth in the Statement of Work.

Non-Price factors combined or individually are significantly more important than Price.

Price will be evaluated in comparison to all offers received in response to the request for quote and Government Estimate.  

Past performance will be rated Neutral if the offeror has no record of Past Performance.

EVALUATION RATINGS

The Government will evaluate technical proposal information/responses.  Each
rating area will be assigned one of four ratings as listed below. The sub factors 
will also be assigned a rating. The offeror may also be rated Neutral in the area 
of Past Performance. Factors 1, 2 and 3 will be rated according to the below 
criteria.  Adjectival technical scoring will be as follows

RATING GUIDANCE

Quoters responses to the factors will be rated using the following scale:

b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>Only authorized resellers of McCabe IQ annual software maintenance products should reply to this posting.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541519. The NGA plans to issue a firm fixed price purchase order under FAR Part 12 and 13. The requirement is for the following items:

1) Annual Maintenance of 56 McCabe IQ perpetual software licenses (Part Number M-IQ-SERVER). The period of performance for maintenance shall be 01 Feb 2009 through 31 Jan 2010. 

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: 

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has a requirement for annual software maintenance as outlined above. All of the products referenced in this posting are proprietary products of McCabe. The McCabe suite of software products have already been integrated into the NGA enterprise. Due to this fact, it would be extremely costly to switch to a new type of software. Personnel would have to be trained to use the new software and NGA would suffer unacceptable production delays due to the implementation of the software. The McCabe IQ suite of products is the only software suite that fulfills the form, fit, and function requirements of the NGA at this time. 

Delivery is FOB Destination. Delivery will be made to: NGA Arnold, 3838 Vogel Rd., Arnold, MO 63010-6238.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is soliciting Standard Form-330s (SF-330) for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Architectural and Engineering (A-E) services contract for work within the state of Arkansas.  The contract will include performance of any part or all services necessary to provide recommendations and guidance to others, review the work of others, and/or performing planning, sediment surveys, principal spillway/structure inspections, engineering surveys, geologic investigations, construction inspection and engineering designs services that may be needed for planning, design, and/or review of various conservation practices, flood prevention and water resources projects. The flood prevention and water resource projects are, but not be limited to work authorized by the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act, Public Law 83-566 (PL-566), otherwise known as The Small Watershed Program and work authorized by Section 14 of Public Law 83-566 (enacted by Section 313 of Public Law 106-472, otherwise known as The Small Watershed Rehabilitation Amendments of 2000).  PL-566 project purposes include watershed protection, flood prevention, erosion and sediment control, water supply, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat enhancement, wetlands creation and or restoration, and public recreation in watersheds of 250,000 or fewer acres. Project measures may consist of, but not be limited to land treatment practices, channel improvements, floodwater retarding structures (dam(s)), floodways, floodwater diversions, sediment basins, grade stabilization structures, and streambank stabilization.  Design and construction inspection services for various conservation practices will primarily be for projects authorized by the Environmental Quality Incentive Program.  Typical practices include but are not limited to animal waste practices such as waste storage structures, composting facilities, waste treatment lagoons and other storage facilities.  Other practices may include irrigation practices and soil conservation practices.  A complete list of conservation practices may be found at http://efotg.nrcs.usda.gov/efotg_locator.aspx?map=AR . Rehabilitation work on a dam is defined as all work necessary to extend the service life of a dam and meet applicable safety and performance standards. Rehabilitation work may include, but not limited to protecting the integrity of the dam or prolonging the useful life of the dam beyond the original evaluated life expectancy; upgrading the dam to meet changed land use conditions in a watershed served by the dam or changed safety criteria applicable to the dam, relocating potentially impacted individuals or public works of improvements, and/or decommissioning (removal) of the structure and stabilizing the site. Planning will require assembling an experienced interdisciplinary staff to provide recommendations and/or guidance to others, review the work of others, and/or develop a Plan or Supplemental Plan/ Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement (Plan/EA or EIS). An experienced interdisciplinary staff may consist of, but not be limited to, an engineer, economist, biologist, geologist, surveyors, construction inspectors, civil engineering technicians and  others. Federal policy, procedures and requirements to review or develop the Plan EA or EIS are outlined in the USDA-NRCS National Watershed Manual (NWSM) (for PL-566 projects and rehabilitation work) and the Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources Implementation Studies (P&G).  Planning shall be in compliance with all National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) provisions.  The designs of conservation practices shall be in accordance with the practice standard.  The firm will furnish all personnel, equipment, materials, other incidental services, tools, travel, facilities, and all other incidental items necessary to provide the services. The typical project could require knowledge and experience in surveying, planning, engineering design, conservation practice design, seismic analysis, hydrologic and hydraulic analysis for planning of complex watersheds, geologic investigations, economic analysis, construction inspection, site layout, documentation of contractors work and project related biological, cultural resource and environmental assessments.

<SOLNBR>N00421-09-t-0041
<RESPDATE>030409
<CONTACT>Francine L Keys, Purchasing Agent, Phone (301) 757-9057, Fax 301-757-8959, Email francine.keys@navy.mil
<DESC>Solicitation N00421-T-0041 is issued as a request for quote (RFQ).  The Government intends to purchase on a firm fixed-price basis and to solicit and negotiate the proposed purchase order on a competitive basics. , The descriptions listed below, under the authority of FAR Part 13.104.
A.) Background 
In order to maintain the test cells in the Propulsion Systems Evaluation Facility (PSEF), a laser alignment measuring system that aligns rotating shafts on test articles and other components is critical to test installations.  Currently, the Propulsion Systems Evaluation Facility uses dial indicators and alignment shafts for the alignment procedures.  Using the dial indicators and alignment shafts takes an extended amount of time.  This laser alignment system will potentially reduce the amount of time and effort to align and install test assets in each test cell and reduce the risk of damaging these assets.  Also, the laser alignment tools are reduced in size and are applicable to many of our propulsion systems and test cells.  PSEF has a requirement to align high speed rotating shafts on various types of equipment.  The minimum requirements are listed below.   
B.) Minimum Technical Requirements
1. 	Provide a Laser Alignment System with the ability to align rotating shafts (large and small) and similar components. The system will have the ability to be attached to shafts and rotating components from 1 to 10 inches in diameter and a range of 1 inch to 25 ft from source to receiver.  
 
2. 	Provide Supporting Equipment 

a. Small/Thin clamping devices which support the Laser alignment tools in a 1-2 inch space. (smallest footprint possible for maximum range of movement) 

b. The system will be able to align a rotating component and will sweep no more than 90 Degrees for a complete alignment procedure. This minimal degree of rotation will provide an advantage if there is a section hindering the movement of the equipment.  

c. In order to fulfill the requirement of being wireless, remote control capability is needed between the laser and the control console. This will mitigate and avoid any alignment issues when having unnecessary wires attached to the components.  The control console must be powered independently and wireless.  

d. Magnetic/Link/Chain Bracket System that attaches the rotating component in a tight and secure manner in order to avoid inaccurate readings.  This system will be able to attach to all types of rotating shafts (metal, non-metal).
 
e. Software Package compatible with Windows XP service pack 2.   This software will display any calculated values, graphical illustrations, and be capable of printing documents once transferred to the PC.  This software must be applicable with the following hardware: Intel Core 2 Duo 2 GHz, 1 GB RAM, 256 Video Card RAM, and a 24 X CDRW-DVD Combo drive.   
		
f. Ability to store data and create archive files onto a PC (deliver data via USB connection).

3. Provide a Training course at the Propulsion Systems Evaluation Facility (1-2 day training for 8 members).  Training will occur within 2 weeks of the delivery.  

4. Provide three Hardcopy Instruction Manuals and one electronic copy.  These will include detailed procedures to use the equipment and software applications when aligning rotating systems.  

5. Provide a minimum of a 1 year warranty (parts and labor) from time of arrival.  The Laser Alignment equipment will be delivered either via insured (full value) express mail delivery (2-3 day) and/or hand delivered. For equipment failure/malfunction, there will be a 2 week turnaround from the Contractors date of receipt.  
C.) Deliverables
The Laser alignment system and all supporting equipment are to be delivered to the PSEF building at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station. 

Mailing Address: 	Propulsion Systems Evaluation Facility 
22229 Elmer Road Building 2360
Patuxent River, MD 20670
D.) Delivery Date
The contractor shall deliver the Laser Alignment System no later than 30 calendar days post contract award. 
Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by 4 March 2009 will be considered by the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The Government will not pay for any information received.  Facsimile proposals are acceptable.  For information contact Francine Keys, Telephone (301) 757-9057 , FAX (301) 757-8959

(a) Prohibitions. 

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;
 (g) A copy of the approved waiver, if a waiver has already been granted, or the waiver request, if a waiver has been applied for, shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Brand Name commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a fixed price quotation is requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA-09-Q-0032 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-29, effective January 19, 2009 & 2005-30, effective 15 Jan 2009.

This is a 100% small business set-aside under NAICS 611420 with a size standard of $7.0 million. The Government reserves the right to issue an order following evaluation of initial quotes without discussions. Evaluation and order issuance will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106, Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation. An order will be issued to the vendor whose conforming quotation in response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government. Best value for this order will be obtained through a lowest priced technically acceptable evaluation. BACKGROUND: The National Archives and Records Administrations (NARA) Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum possesses an entire digital collection of papers, documents, photographs and audio recordings of President John F. Kennedy. This is made possible by the Digital Asset Management System which is housed in two separate equipment racks; Centera storage system (rack one) and Clariion system (rack two). The software systems running the Clariion and Centera systems include: Application Xtender, Web Xtender, and Disk Xtender which are proprietary to the EMC Software Group. An upgrade of the existing EMC software systems is scheduled for spring 2009. The two newly assigned archivists to this project require on-line training on this software as well as on-line training on the pre-existing EMC hardware. Due to the proprietary nature of the hardware/software it has been determined that only EMC or one of its partner companies can provide the aforementioned required on-line training. This on-line training includes; Technical Fundamentals of Documentum, System Administration for Documentum- Fundamentals and Captiva: InputAccel Fundamentals & Administration. For more information on the requested on-line training please see Attachment 1. REQUIREMENTS: This is a Brand Name, firm-fixed price RFQ and all delivery costs should be included in total estimated value.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.

Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships.

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

PURPOSE: 
The purpose of the ASDRS Demonstration is to show the technical maturity of an actively stabilized drogue system for use in probe and drogue aerial refueling operations.  Following sufficient build up test flights, this demonstration will culminate in one or more flight tests of the ASDRS as part of the Navys X-47B Unmanned Combat Air System (UCAS-D) Autonomous Aerial Refueling (AAR) demonstration program.  The ASDRS shall be compatible with the current ARS design and operating envelope, including the transfer of fuel, demonstrating system performance and robustness in various probe and drogue (P&D) aerial refueling scenarios.

SCHEDULE
Award of an ASDRS demonstration program contract is expected 2nd QTR FY 2010, with the goal of successfully completing Safety of Flight/Airworthiness qualification no later than the 4th QTR FY 2011 (earlier is preferred).  It is anticipated that the integration asset(s) will be delivered no later than 3rd QTR FY 2011.  Following that, the program is expected to successfully demonstrate the stabilized drogue operation with manned F/A-18 receiver aircraft no later than 1st QTR FY 2012 and be ready for demonstration with the X-47B receiver no later than 4th QTR FY 2012.  The Government will require the delivery of a Technical Data Package (TDP) to support Flight Clearance in the 2nd QTR FY2011 timeframe.

DEMONSTRATION OBJECTIVES
1)	Develop and integrate an Airworthy ASDRS into the existing ARS system on the F/A-18E/F platform that will support both manned and unmanned refueling demonstrations.  
2)	Demonstrate reduction of drogue motion bandwidth (frequency and amplitude) as compared to a standard drogue at F/A-18 E/F NATOPS representative aerial refueling tracks, altitudes and airspeeds under atmospheric conditions encountered during demonstration.  Under these conditions, the ASDRS shall support repeated, successful plugs by surrogate and X-47B receiver aircraft.  Moderate turbulence conditions, if not demonstrated in flight, shall be demonstrated via analysis.
3)	Demonstrate accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability of the drogue position sensing function relative to the tanker (integrity, continuity and availability are demonstrated by analysis with verification of assumptions via flight test).
4)	Demonstrate ability of the drogue stabilization function to hold the drogue relative to a predetermined point (nominally the natural trail point of the drogue), including compensating for biases such as those caused by receiver forebody effects and other disturbances such as turbulence, tanker-induced motion, etc.
5)	Support safe and effective demonstration with multiple probe and drogue refueling systems/ operations (manned and unmanned), to include the transfer of fuel with: 
	Probe-equipped Navy aircraft (piloted refueling)
	Probe-equipped UAS Surrogate such as an F/A-18 C/D (automatic control refueling)
	X-47B (autonomous refueling)
6)	Optional Objectives
	Ability to integrate the ASDRS into other drogue-equipped tanker systems (such as commercial Omega tankers) to support demonstration
	Consideration of stabilization modes for the ASDRS (e.g., inertial vs tanker body stabilization, considerations of wing-mounted systems, compensation for tanker motion)

DESIGN/ TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES
1)	Integration Objectives
a.	Adapts to ARS hose end and tailcone (stowage tunnel) without modification to the ARS.  Minor modifications to the stowage tunnel (for drogue stowage) and to the ARS exterior (for sensor apertures) may be allowable, if the impact is minimized. 
b.	Supports integration of the ARS with the F/A-18E/F, including additional data interface and control functions as required to support the demonstration
c.	Equivalent aerodynamic performance (drag, stability, extension, retraction) over the same or greater envelope as the current ARS.  ARS system shall not require design/performance modifications to incorporate stabilized drogue.
d.	Capable of providing relative drogue positioning information at the receiver aircraft via installation of sensors on the receiver aircraft (design capable; not part of this effort)
2)	Performance Objectives
a.	Design capable of continuous operation  neither mission endurance nor turnaround time shall be limited by power available on the ASDRS. 
b.	Reduced drogue motion bandwidth to less than 10 cm, 2 sigma at frequencies of 0.7 Hz or less at altitudes of 1500 to 30,000 ft in conditions up to and including moderate turbulence.
c.	System availability (via analysis and demonstration) of 98% or greater
d.	Maintain constant receiver sight picture
e.	Drogue position sensing technique supports Low Probability of Intercept/ Low Probability of Detection.
f.	Maintainability and reliability shall be an inherent consideration in the design.  Although the demo design is not intended to be production-representative, there shall be a clear path from the demo design to an operational system.
3)	Interface Objectives
a.	Architecture shall be compatible with manned receiver aircraft and X-47B receiver.   
b.	Data from drogue position sensing system and integrity information shall support network interface at the tanker for transmission to the receiver
c.	External data interfaces support open architecture, non-proprietary data exchanges
d.	Design shall meet North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Standardization Agreement STANAG 3447 requirements for the probe/drogue interface
4)	Safety Objectives
a.	Operation of the ASDRS should reduce probability of failed engagement and drogue fuselage strike for manned and unmanned operations
b.	The controlling mechanism and sensor package (actuators, sensor apertures, etc) shall minimize susceptibility to strike/impact damage
c.	The ASDRS shall be designed to minimize Foreign Object Debris/Damage (FOD) probability.  
d.	Integrity to detect when the system should not be used with the control system enabled
e.	Integrity to detect when the drogue positioning information is invalid (Performance estimation and Fault detection functions) 
f.	Capability to be safely used in a system off state for both manned and unmanned receivers.
g.	Capability to be used with the position sensing function only (active stabilization disabled)
h.	Safe failure/ degraded modes of control system operation
i.	Indication shall be made to the external interface (tanker) when the ASDRS system determines the refueling operation should be discontinued.

TASKS
1)	Offeror shall provide design products for, and participate in, a tailored Systems Engineering Technical Review (SETR) process for the ASDRS as part of the overall X-47B AAR demonstration program.
2)	Offeror shall provide review of, and input to, an ASDRS system specification for government approval.
3)	Systems analysis shall be provided to predict overall system reliability.
4)	The Offeror shall develop, conduct and deliver analysis with the necessary models and simulations to characterize the system performance of the ASDRS.  Safety of Flight clearance / Airworthiness analysis shall be based on a system model as verified during testing.  Analysis should include factors that contribute to drogue instability and the effectiveness of the ASDRS to counteract each of these contributing factors.
5)	The Offeror shall provide a six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) model(s) to support integration with Government analysis tools.  The model(s) shall consist of:
a.	Drogue aerodynamic model (including hose and hose reel response dynamics as appropriate)
b.	Mechanical dynamic model of system components
c.	Receiver effects
d.	Atmospheric gusts/turbulence
e.	Inner loop and outer loop control law model(s) as implemented for the ASDRS.

<DESC><BR>Request for Comments  Draft Performance Specification<BR><BR>This is an Army/Marine Corps request. All interested parties are advised that the Government will not pay for, or provide any reimbursement for the information provided.  No contract or other instrument will be issued as a result of this request for information and no reimbursement will be provided for any information submitted.  Any costs associated with providing the Market Survey/Request for Information submissions will be solely at the expense of the concern submitting the information.  <BR><BR>The PEO-CS & CSS Office, on behalf of the warfighter, is seeking information on Industrys knowledge and expertise related to a Mine Resistant Ambushed Protected (MRAP) class recovery vehicle.  This recovery vehicle will provide the capability to be able to retrieve vehicles ranging in weight from 38,000-73,000 lbs.  <BR><BR>A performance specification has been drafted which lays out the specific characteristics that the PEO-CS & CSS Office is looking for in this recovery vehicle.  With the Industrys comments relaying their knowledge and expertise of recovery vehicles, the program office can further mature the performance specification while also developing an acquisition plan.  The performance specification consists of both a classified and unclassified portion which states the requirements to be met with this recovery vehicle.  The procedures to receive both sections of the specification are outlined below. <BR><BR>If the performance requirements create an inconsistency or if two or more requirements cannot be achieved, because some aspects are mutually exclusive, you are asked to identify the issue and recommend how it might best be resolved.  An alternative approach may be that if the indicated performance parameters are not achievable with a single vehicle at a reasonable weight, interested parties may address how the capabilities may be achieved using multiple platforms.  Request that all responders keep in mind the impacts from performing recovery operations in mountainous terrain with poorly developed roadways.<BR><BR>It is important to understand that an acquisition strategy has not yet been developed for this requirement and it has yet to be determined whether the strategy will be a full and open competition or be limited to the five current MRAP original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).    <BR><BR>In order to provide comments to the Government, your firm must request the detailed information on the recovery vehicle, including the classified and unclassified portions of the performance specification, by sending your facility clearance information, and the name of your security officer, along with their security information to:<BR><BR>Ms. P. Ryczek<BR>PEO CS & CSS ~ SFAE-CS&CSS-MRAP<BR>Mail Stop #298<BR>US Army TACOM<BR>Warren, MI 48397-5000	<BR>Phone: 586.574.7940<BR>Email: Pam.Ryczek@us.army.mil<BR>(Do NOT send CUI or FOUO via electronic mail)	<BR><BR>Interested parties are to provide a brief company description along with your expertise in providing this type of vehicle.  Interested parties are to provide this information to Ms. Ryczek (listed above) and request the two portions of the performance specification.  Please include the companys unclassified mailing address and POC information, secure fax number, classified mailing address along with DSS office for SF 254, CAGE code and security POC (email and phone number). Comments provided by interested parties may be used in maturing the performance specification while also structuring an acquisition plan solely at the Governments discretion.  <BR><BR>NOTE: If the interested party is a foreign concern, or if a US interested party has a team member or partner who is a foreign entity, they will need to adhere to all ITAR requirements.<BR><BR>NOTE:  All information must be provided in a format readable by MS Word 2003, or MS Excel 2003.  If your submittal contains classified information, it should be properly labeled.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

The Purple Book is a compilation book(now mostly available in electronic format) that is a schedule of ULC's class sessions/offerings.  <BR><BR>Question 10: With regard to PAST PERFORMANCE RISK ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE, is the first section (Part 1) supposed to refer to the work done for the client whom the questionnaire will be distributed to, or is it to identify this bid info?<BR><BR>Response: Part 1 refers to work done for the client whom the questionnaire is being distributed to and not information pertaining to this specific solicitation. <BR><BR>Question 11: Do the CLIN responses (pp. 28-36 of the RFQ) count against the overall page limit (30 pages) for the proposal?<BR><BR>Response: CLIN responses do not count again the overall page limitation. <BR><BR>Question 12: Can resumes be in standard format without double-spacing?<BR><BR>Response: Resumes can be in standard format but should adhere to the space and font guidelines in the addendum to FAR 52.212-1.<BR><BR><BR>Question 13: Having final drafts of the visual aids and student workbooks/manuals seems slightly premature; can outlines of the visual aids and student workbooks be submitted at the post award meeting versus the final drafts? <BR><BR>Response: The schedule of instruction, instructor lesson plan, and student manual/workbook are interrelated documents. It was requested that the final drafts of each document be delivered at the post award meeting because during the post award meeting, the awardee and the government will discuss the submitted items and any needed changes. It is important that the submitted documents be as close as possible to the intended final version (versus merely an outline) because schedules may not permit numerous exchanges between the awardee and the government to finalize the submitted documents before the start of the first session. <BR><BR>Question 14: Can you explain what/who Gallup is and how it relates to the project?<BR> <BR>Response: The Gallup Organization (most well known for the Gallup Poll) in this context uses an inventory called StrengthsFinder to assess traits of individuals. Students in this course complete that inventory in advance of the session they will attend. A consultant from Gallup conducts the second day of each session and, among other things, discusses how each students traits (often called strengths) might be used if forming a leadership style. <BR><BR>Question 15: In box 17a. of form 1449, what does the ODE portion of the box refer to? Where would I find the applicable code to enter into that box? Also, I am assuming that form 1449 should be printed, filled in and scanned back into the electronic bid. Is that how you would like bidders to handle this form?<BR><BR>Response: In accordance with addendum FAR 52.212-1 of the issued solicitation, quoters should complete blocks 12, 17a, and 30a, b, and c of the SF 1449 and submit all applicable pages using one of the authorized methods of submission listed: standard mail, email, or hand delivery. The code portion is not applicable at this point in time. <BR> <BR>Question 16: In the pricing section, items 0001, 0012 and 1009 ask for travel cost estimates. On page 26, paragraph e it states NO PRICES HAVE TO BE QUOTED FOR THE ESTIMATED TRAVEL CLINS 0012 and 1009; Does this mean that we would only give a travel cost estimate for item 0001, the post award meeting?<BR><BR>Response: The only travel component that requires pricing by vendors is that associated with attending the post award meeting. <BR><BR>Other clarifications:<BR><BR>**Final drafts of the SOI, ILPs, handouts, visual aids, and student workbooks/manuals to be used in conjunction with each session shall be included in the quoted price and delivered at the post award meeting. If any changes are needed to the submitted items, (the completion date for) these changes will be conveyed at the post award meeting. Doing so allows ULC ample time to copy/print all materials and ship them directly to the site of instruction. <BR><BR>**If the proposed instructors have performed under separate contracts for the respective firm, past performance questionnaire should be submitted for at least one contract that each of proposed instructors has performed under. <BR> <BR>**The content of each paragraph should be double spaced while each individual paragraph can be separated using single spacing** <BR>

<DESC><p>W912DY-08-R-0021<br />INDEFINITE DELIVERY CONTRACT FOR MEDICAL FACILITIES A-E SERVICES - UNRESTRICTED COMPETITION<br />________________________________________</p>
<p>Description<br />CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. Architectural Engineering services are required to support the Department of Defense Medical (DoDM) program Medical Facilities A-E Services (MFAES) requirements. Huntsville Center is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Medical Facilities Mandatory Center of Expertise and Standardization (MX), and partners with the Corps' project delivery teams, regional business centers/divisions, stakeholders and geographical districts to provide medical expertise and the highest quality medical and medical research facility life cycle support to the Department of Defense (DoD), other federal agencies and foreign governments. The DoDM program funds Army, Air Force and Navy medical treatment, housing, and research facilities. Since originally directed by Congress and established in 1978, the MX has the responsibility to develop medical design and construction policies, technical guidance, procedures, criteria, specifications, and standards that integrate medical unique design, construction and operational requirements. In order to accomplish this objective, the Huntsville Center proposes to award a Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC). Each award will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract, with a base year and four option years, under which firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders will be negotiated. Contracts are anticipated to be awarded with FY09's, 4th quarter funds. The North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330 and the size standard is $4,500,000.00. The total requirements expected to be awarded under the MFAES Unrestricted A-E contracts are anticipated to equal approximately $234,000,000.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 36.209, the A-E Contractor and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for a DoDM construction (with design-build capabilities) contract. The Government will provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order exceeding $3,000 issued under the multiple ID/IQ A-E contracts, unless an exemption provided in FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies. The Government may not contact each of the multiple awardees under the contract before selecting an order awardee. Large businesses must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The extent of participation of such firms in terms of the value of the total acquisition will be evaluated. The plan should detail the proposed participation percentages, or lack thereof. CEHNC has established small business goals as an assistance to assure small business receives a fair portion of awards. The goals for the unrestricted portion of this procurement are as follows: Small Business: 7% of total contract value; Small Disadvantaged Business: 6.2% of the total contract value; Woman-Owned Small Business: 7% of the total contract value; Historically Underutilized Business Zone Small Business: 9.8% of the total contract value; Veteran Owned Small Business: 3% of the total contract value; Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business: 0.9% of the total contact value. The plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the proposal of the firm selected for negotiations.</p>
<p>PROJECT INFORMATION: The Medical Facility A-E Services contracts will set forth the general requirements for the performance of various services in support of the DoDM Program to include planning, survey, energy conservation and analyses studies, and other investigations/studies; comprehensive interior designs; development of Request For Proposal (RFP); and design services related to new construction, upgrade, maintenance, and repair of various medical facilities, including related infrastructure systems, medical equipment planning and components worldwide.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS/PRE SOLICITATION NOTICE<BR>SIGNATURE SUPPORT PROGRAM<BR><BR>The purpose of this modification is to change the NAICS code to 541990 and change to procurement process to full and open.  This requirement is no longer a small business set-aside.<BR>POC for this requirement: Shelly Willis Email: shelly.willis1@us.army.mil or Jo Robinson Email jo.m.robinson@us.army.mil<BR><BR><BR>The U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Signature Support Program (SSP) requirement.  The requirement is for a Base year with four-option years.   The Government intends to release the RFP on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website:  www.fbo.gov through the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) Acquisition Business Website:  https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/  on or around  March 23, 2009. The requirement will be procured as a full and open acquisition, therefore all responsible sources may submit a response to the RFP, and if timely received, will be considered by the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command. <BR><BR> The NAICS code for this action is 541990.  The SSP is a joint, multi-agency activity sponsored by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) to meet increased customer demands for signature data. The SSPs overarching goal is to facilitate the access to high-quality signatures to a diverse customer base. To do this, the SSP leverages the full spectrum of signature related activities (initial collection, processing, development, detailed analysis, and production) within the Department of Defense (DoD), the Intelligence Community (IC), and various other U.S. Government agencies. The program addresses a host of signature types, including, but not limited to, acoustic, biological, chemical, seismic, radio frequency, infrared, radar, nuclear radiation, electro-optical, and biometrics. The SSP provides access to signature data on foreign and domestic military and commercial systems such as ground vehicles, fixed and rotary wing aircraft, missiles, munitions, rockets, ships, and submarines, as well as other types of signature data e.g. chemical and biological warfare agents, lasers, and dynamic phenomena (events and activities). This contract performance work statement includes support to collection efforts, as well as processing, analysis, categorizing, and modeling of measurement and signature data from various sources and targets, and across multiple disciplines worldwide. It also includes database assessment, modification, testing, installation, maintenance, sustainment and upgrades to components of the SSP Application as well as the scientific programs (analytical tools) used to process and/or manage the signature data. This also encompasses efforts to support SSP Signature Organizations and other SSP activities as they relate to measurement and signature processing and analysis, as well as the establishment and sustainment of a system of Signature Organizations operating within the SSP for the generation, management, and utilization of Signature Data within the National Signature Community. In order to efficiently sustain and modify a high-quality and meaningful data repository system, it is essential for the contract awardee to have working knowledge and expertise in the collection, processing, and analysis of signature data, as well as current expertise in Oracle database design.<BR><BR>This requirement will be procured under the guidelines of FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command  requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR.  For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/. <BR><BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The Contractor shall provide expert legal services in support of Treasury investments in private-sector institutions under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA).  Work under the contract is expected to include the following tasks:

Task 1 - Subchapter S Investment Structure/Documentation.  The Contractor will assist Treasury in developing the form, structure, terms and conditions, and documentation for Treasury investments in entities that are taxed under Chapter 1, Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code.  Such Treasury investments may include co-investment accompanying private sector investment, Government investment without private sector investment, purchases of assets or debt instruments and other direct investments.  The draft investment documentation shall conform with all terms, conditions, and requirements of the Act, regulations, Treasury policy, and best practices, and shall be acceptable to Treasury in all other respects.  

Task 2  Transaction Closing Legal Services.  The Contractor will handle closings of EESA investment transactions where existing counsel under Treasurys Capital Purchase Program (CPP) are unable to perform due to conflicts of interest.  The Contractor also may be tasked to handle closings of transactions for which it has created documentation.  In all such transactions, the Contractor will be responsible for (1) conducting any due diligence required for the transaction, (2) customizing form agreements to document the transaction, (3) reviewing executed agreements for legal sufficiency and completeness; (4) identifying insufficiencies or legal issues that require action before the transactions can be closed; (5) notifying and working with the institution and Treasury in resolving those issues; (6) conducting the closing of the transaction, and (7) handling any post-closing matters associated with transactions under the program.  

Other Tasks.  Treasury may also issue other task orders within the general scope of this contract.  The specific services to be performed by the Contractor will be defined in individual task orders.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows] (a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. "Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of provision) NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011. Anticipated award date is no later than 22 December 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 21 December 2008. PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION. Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Dennis Gaines at 252-334-5220. Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I
