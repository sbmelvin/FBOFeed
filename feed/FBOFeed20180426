<DESC><p>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Global Positioning Systems (GPS) Directorate intends to issue and award a sole source contract modification to L-3 Interstate Electronics Corporation (IEC), contract FA8807-12-C-0011. The modification will define a next-generation Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) to a preliminary design maturity in order to replace and resolve a current MGUE Increment 1 ASIC obsolescence problem. The proposed contract action will not require the delivery of any receiver cards; rather it will require the delivery of technical data (e.g., design review data packages that will include revised ASIC design specifications, requirements traceability, verification plans, system receiver design description, software architecture, performance analysis and system trade study results, security target and architecture, and contract administration information).</p>
<p>The MGUE Increment 1 program includes a Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) identification program (a.k.a. obsolescence). The core technology of the MGUE program lies within the ASIC, which will become obsolete in 2020 because of a termination in production from the supplier. This contract modification is required to implement the next-generation ASIC design activities up to a preliminary design in order to move towards replacing the current ASIC, which would solve the obsolescence issue.</p>
<p>This modification will continue the MGUE Increment 1 Acquisition Strategy by addressing the DMSMS problem for the ASIC. It will have a period of performance of approximately three years. The three years supports the lead time needed to bring a new ASIC design up to a preliminary design maturity. The Government intends to use the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(a)(2) to award this sole source modification. Based on the extensive development efforts completed to date and the proprietary nature of the MGUE Increment 1 M-Code ASIC and receiver design, award to any other sources is not possible without the Air Force experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements. Any other source would have to comply with currently proprietary documents, such as ASIC design specifications, requirements traceability, verification plans, and software architecture.</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any costs associated with the production and submission of information in response to this or previous notices.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capability shall identify and provide copies of all licenses, of all intellectual property required, and lawfully obtained, needed to design a next- generation ASIC to meet requirements for interfacing with the L-3 MGUE Increment 1 receiver card products. Responsible Sources intending to submit a statement of capability should inform the Government of their intention no later than 15 days following this posting. Award of this modification is intended for a date of no later than October 2018. Responsible sources shall submit all responses to this notice no later than 45 days after posting in accordance with FAR 5.203(e).</p>
<p>Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. A responding firm should indicate if it is a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, an 8(a) firm, a historically black college or university, or a minority institution.</p>
<p>All inquiries and responses to this notice shall be in writing and submitted to the Procurement Contracting Officer, Dominicke A. Ybarra. Email: dominicke.ybarra@us.af.mil,. Mailing Address: SMC/GP Attn: Dominicke A. Ybarra, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., Suite 2142-A8, Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, California 90245-2808.</p>

The proposed contract action will not require the delivery of any receiver cards; rather it will require the delivery of technical data (e.g., design review data packages that will include revised ASIC design specifications, requirements traceability, verification plans, system receiver design description, software architecture, performance analysis and system trade study results, security target and architecture, and contract administration information).<br /><br />The MGUE Increment 1 program includes a Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortage (DMSMS) identification program (a.k.a. obsolescence). The core technology of the MGUE program lies within the ASIC, which will become obsolete in 2020 because of a termination in production from the supplier. This contract modification is required to implement the next-generation ASIC design activities up to a preliminary design in order to move towards replacing the current ASIC, which would solve the obsolescence issue.<br /><br />This modification will continue the MGUE Increment 1 Acquisition Strategy by addressing the DMSMS problem for the ASIC. It will have a period of performance of approximately three years. The three years supports the lead time needed to bring a new ASIC design up to a preliminary design maturity. The Government intends to use the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(a)(2) to award this sole source modification. Based on the extensive development efforts completed to date and the proprietary nature of the MGUE Increment 1 M-Code ASIC and receiver design, award to any other sources is not possible without the Air Force experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements. Any other source would have to comply with currently proprietary documents, such as ASIC design specifications, requirements traceability, verification plans, and software architecture.<br /><br />This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP). Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any costs associated with the production and submission of information in response to this or previous notices.<br /><br />In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capability shall identify and provide copies of all licenses, of all intellectual property required, and lawfully obtained, needed to design a next- generation ASIC to meet requirements for interfacing with the Rockwell Collins MGUE Increment 1 receiver card products. Responsible Sources intending to submit a statement of capability should inform the Government of their intention no later than 15 days following this posting. Award of this modification is intended for a date of no later than October 2018. Responsible sources shall submit all responses to this notice no later than 45 days after posting in accordance with FAR 5.203(e).<br /><br />Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. A responding firm should indicate if it is a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, an 8(a) firm, a historically black college or university, or a minority institution.<br /><br />All inquiries and responses to this notice shall be in writing and submitted to the Procurement Contracting Officer, Dominicke A. Ybarra. Email: dominicke.ybarra@us.af.mil,. Mailing Address: SMC/GP Attn: Dominicke A. Ybarra, 483 N. Aviation Blvd., Suite 2142-A8, Los Angeles Air Force Base, El Segundo, California 90245-2808.

<DESC>The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCI Agency) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for the provision of Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Tactical Satellite (TACSAT) Radios.
<p>This project will provide UHF TACSAT radio terminals to support the war-fighter with a mix of static, on-the-pause (OTP) and on-the-move (OTM) capabilities in all battle-space environments. A new generation of radios will be required to replace the current inventory, which is becoming obsolete as new UHF waveform technologies, such as the Integrated Waveform (IW), become available. Additionally, because of their persistent long&shy;term use in support of recent and ongoing NATO operations, most of the current inventory is now beyond economic repair.</p>
<p>Potential U.S. prime contractors must 1) confirm in writing that the transaction will be a Direct Commercial Sale (DCS) and not a Foreign Military Sale (FMS), 2) provide documentation that the company's products have received SECAN/MC approval OR documentation that the company has requested SECAN/MC approval, 3) maintain a professionally active facility (office, factory, laboratory, etc.) within the United States, 4) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), 5) hold an active Facility Security Clearance at the level of SECRET or higher, and 6) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-14390-TACSAT, and all correspondence concerning this IFB should reference this number.</p>
<p>SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Please see attached.</p>
<p>BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO BID</p>
<p>NATO ICB requires that the U.S. Government nominate U.S. prime contractors to the bidders list. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. prime contractor to the bidders list, however, the U.S. firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for U.S. NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis.</p>
<p>The U.S. NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume indicating contracts completed as a prime contractor and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>U.S. firms can download a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application from the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/other-areas/strategic-industries-and-economic-security-sies/nato-related-business-opportunities</p>
<p>The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the company employee who should receive the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>- Request from DOC that a DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit the completed one-time NATO ICB application): 11 May 2018</p>
<p>- NCIA issues IFB (target): end of August 2018</p>
<p>- Bid Closing: October 2018</p>
<p>- Contract Award (target): June 2019</p>

<p>Statement of Work<br />TITLE: Development of HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Profiles and Implementation Guide for Vital Records Mortality Reporting <br /><br />I. BACKGROUND <br />II. PURPOSE<br />III. SCOPE OF WORK<br />IV. TASKS TO BE PERFORMED<br />V: GOVERNMENT FURNISHED MATERIALS <br />VI: PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />VII: PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br />VIII: DELIVERABLES/REPORTING<br />IX: TRAVEL</p>
<p>I: BACKGROUND<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) serves as the national focus for developing and applying disease prevention and control, environmental health, and health promotion and health education activities designed to improve the health of the people of the United States. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is located within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is the Nation's principal health statistics agency. It compiles statistical information to guide actions and policies to improve the health of the Nation. It is a unique public resource for monitoring health information and a critical element of public health and health policy.<br />The National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) is one of the data systems within NCHS used for this monitoring activity. NVSS is a legislatively-mandated data program, producing data on births, deaths, and fetal deaths. Over 6.5 million state records are collected annually for processing, coding, analysis, and publication in aggregate form electronically and on paper; of these events, about 2.6 million are death records. The receipt and initial processing of these records and the coding of the cause-of-death literals on them occurs primarily through staff and systems located at the NCHS facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. Subsequent editing, processing, analysis, publication and dissemination of the data occur through staff located at the Hyattsville, Maryland facility.<br />One of the goals of the NVSS is to improve the timeliness and quality of the mortality data. Timely reporting of death information is critical for detecting and defining pandemic and other calamitous events as well as showing shifts in causes of death by age, race and sex. Yet, timely death reporting has been a major challenge for the vital statistics system, partially due to the outdated and inefficient technology and the lack of standards to facilitate the exchange of information between hospital/healthcare based IT systems and electronic vital registration systems.<br />Because much of the data collected through the NVSS comes from hospital and other medical records, NCHS and the vital statistics community have worked collaboratively since 2007 to establish national standards whereby information can be exchanged electronically from hospital and other health records to the electronic registration systems. This work resulted in the publishing of the Health Level Seven International (HL7) Version 3 Domain Analysis Model: Vital Records (VR DAM), Release 1. This document describes the workflows and stakeholders for transmitting birth and death data to and from U.S. vital records systems. It also describes how birth, death and fetal death records are processed in the U.S. and identifies the stakeholders participating in the data exchange. The VR DAM serves as the framework to guide future standards development for vital records exchange. The VR DAM is based on the core set of vital records data elements that are on the United States (U.S.) Standard Certificates of Live Birth and Death and the U.S. Standard Report of Fetal Death. In May 2017, the VR DAM was updated to a Release 2, titled the HL7 Cross-Paradigm Domain Analysis Model: Vital Records Release 2 (VR DAM R2). <br />Since the first release of the VR DAM, information exchange specifications for Vital Records have been developed as HL7 v2.5.1 and v2.6 message conformance profiles; HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) implementation guides and Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) Technical Framework Supplements; and HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) profiles and resource bundles. A prototype, FHIR-based clinical decision support tool for mortality reporting was tested at the IHE Connectathon in January 2018. <br />II: PURPOSE<br />The purpose of this contract is to assist NCHS and its stakeholders with the development of an HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide for mortality reporting. The artifacts created will trace back to the VR DAM R2. The contractor will also assist NCHS in balloting the artifacts through the HL7 balloting process and will help to reconcile any comments received during the balloting process. <br />III: SCOPE OF WORK<br />The Contractor shall develop and establish a procedure to complete the development of an HL7 FHIR Implementation guide that will include the FHIR profiles for mortality reporting. To be of eventual utility, the profiles should be of sufficient detail to inform the development of specifications for FHIR-based Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for electronic death registration systems and to support physician-facing FHIR-based clinical decision support tools for mortality reporting. <br />The contractor will compare the proposed profiles for mortality reporting to the published VR DAM Release 2 as well as the current published version of the HL7 FHIR implementation guide. The Contractor will highlight where revisions to the existing draft mortality profiles may be needed, where relevant profiles have not yet been developed for mortality reporting, and where any inconsistencies exist between the existing draft profiles for mortality and the current published version of the FHIR implementation guide. The contractor will also help NCHS to prepare for the FHIR DevDays event to be held in Boston in June 2018 and will lead the FHIR profiling work for mortality reporting that will take place during that event. The contractor will also develop all materials and artifacts needed to assist NCHS with the HL7 balloting process for the FHIR Implementation guide for mortality reporting, including but not limited to helping NCHS to reconcile any comments received during the balloting process and publishing a final HL7 implementation guide. <br />IV: TASKS TO BE PERFORMED<br />The contractor shall complete the development of FHIR profiles for mortality reporting as defined in the tasks below. All labor, materials, and equipment shall be required to complete the defined tasks. <br />Work Breakdown<br />The following data flow diagram illustrates the major tasks in this project and the relationship this project has to work products produced in related external projects:<br /><br />Specific Tasks<br />The contractor is expected to complete the work in two phases. The tasks involved in each project phase are described below.<br />Phase I: Vital Records Death Reporting STU FHIR Implementation Guide. Prepare a Standard for Trail Use version of an HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide for use by jurisdictional public health agencies in obtaining vital records death notifications and forwarding applicable death report records to the NCHS.<br /><br />Phase I Tasks Descriptions<br />1. FHIR Resource Profiling. Use output work products from the US Core Implementation Guide Development project, the Vital Records Domain Analysis Model Specification Modeling Project, and the Death on FHIR Prototype Project (see https://nightingaleproject.github.io/fhir-death-record/guide/index.html and https://github.com/nightingaleproject/fhir-death-record/) to select or define the applicable FHIR resources required to enable jurisdictional and national vital records death reporting. Create FHIR resource profiles to constrain and extend the selected FHIR resources to meet the data requirements of vital records death reporting.<br />2. FHIR Implementation Guide Development. Create Bundle resource specifications to serve as grouping a set of profiled resources to act as an exchangeable collection of data for use as the payload of exchanges defined for death reporting in the Vital Records DAM. Create an Implementation Guide resource and specification defining the set of rules about how the bundles of death reporting FHIR resource profiles are to be implemented in software solutions supporting vital record death reporting. This will include presenting the project to the Health Level Seven International (HL7) Public Health Workgroup and updating the existing HL7 Project Scope Statement to reflect how the draft FHIR profiles can help support the development of FHIR APIs and FHIR-based clinical decision support tools for mortality reporting.<br />3. Vital Record Death Reporting STU FHIR IG Balloting. Prepare the Vital Records Death Reporting Implementation guide for inclusion in an HL7 ballot as a standard for trial use. Obtain and consolidate the ballot comments made by members of the ballot pool in preparation for review and reconciliation.

The fingerprint charts may also be completed through a local state, county or city law enforcement agency at the employee's place of residence.</p>
<p>Using the required information specified above, a National Agency Check and Inquiry (NACI) will be processed by the CDC through the Office of Personnel Management and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (OPM/FBI) on each contract employee who will be performing duties on-site.</p>
<p>(d) Removal of Contractor Employees</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor to immediately remove any contract employee from the on-site facility who has failed to receive a suitability determination and whose continued employment is deemed contrary to the public interest, inconsistent with the best interests of security, or is identified as a potential threat to the health, safety, security, general well-being or operational mission of the on-site facility and its population. The Contracting Officer may also request the Contractor to immediately remove any contract employee from the on-site facility should it be determined that the individuals are being assigned to duty who have been disqualified for suitability reasons, or who are found to be unfit for performing duties during their tour(s) of duty. Contract employees who are requested to be removed from the on-site facility are required to leave the work site immediately.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will make all determinations regarding the removal of any contract employee from the on-site facility, except under certain conditions. When a Contracting Officer is not available, either during the day or after normal business hours, or in situations where a delay would not be in the best interest of the Government, or a potential threat to the health, safety, security, general well- being or operational mission of the facility and its population, the Project Officer will have the authority to direct immediate removal of the contractor employee from the on-site facility. The Contracting Officer shall subsequently provide the official notification to the Contractor for removal of a contract employee from the CDC facility. When removal is directed due to a non-suitability determination as a result of the NACI, no further information will be provided. If removal is directed for other reasons relating to specific conduct of the employee during performance of the work, the Contracting Officer's official notification will provide information as to these reasons.</p>
<p>(e) Identification Badges/Cardkey Access: <br /><br />(1) Identification Badges:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall require each contract employee who has been authorized unescorted access to an on-site facility, either through the temporary clearance process or the formal NACI process, to display an identification badge as required and furnished by the CDC. The Contractor shall submit to the Project Officer a completed Identification Badge Request Form (CDC Form 0.1137) for each contract employee who has been authorized unescorted access to an on-site facility. Contact the Project Officer for details on additional procedures, specific addresses and hours of business for issuance of Identification Badges for all other CDC locations.</p>
<p>(2) Cardkey Access:</p>
<p>Unescorted access to certain on-site facilities at CDC may only be gained through the use of a Cardkey. If a contract employee has been determined to need regular unescorted access to one of the Cardkey access designated areas, a Cardkey Request Form (CDC Form 0.834) must be completed and submitted to the Project Officer for written approval. Contact the Project Officer for details of procedures and specific addresses and hours of business for issuance of Cardkey Access.</p>
<p>(3) Return of Identification Badges/Cardkeys</p>
<p>The Contractor shall arrange for the return of any employee identification badges and/or cardkeys immediately upon their separation of the duties at the on-site facility. Contact the Project Officer for location of the depositories for the return of badges. Cardkeys shall be returned to the appropriate Physical Security Activity Office.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p>G. NON-PERSONAL SERVICES TASKS<br /><br />The Government and the Contractor understand and agree that the services to be delivered under this contract by the Contractor to the Government are non-personal services and the parties recognize and agree that no employer-employee relationship exists or will exist under the contract between the Government and the Contractor personnel. It is, therefore, in the best interest of the Government to afford both parties a full and complete understanding of their respective obligations.</p>
<p>Contractors are not federal employees, and federal employees may not interact with contractor personnel as if there is an employer-employee relationship. This means that federal employees do not:</p>
<p>&bull; Supervise contractor employees;<br />&bull; Hire, fire or discipline contractor personnel;<br />&bull; Schedule individual contractor personnel hours;<br />&bull; Reassign contractor personnel;<br />&bull; Grant or deny contractor personnel leave requests (but you have the right and obligation to know which personnel will be on-site and when);<br />&bull; Assess performance or individual contractor personnel;<br />&bull; Provide performance feedback to individual contractor personnel;<br />&bull; Provide input for contractor employee's annual (or periodic) performance appraisals;<br />&bull; Provide or discuss contractor employee performance and career development plans;<br />&bull; Provide training not stipulated in the contract to contractor personnel without coordination with the Contracting Officer and/or Office of General Counsel; and<br />&bull; Provide rewards or awards unless performance meets specific criteria and they are approved by the Contracting Officer and the OGC.</p>
<p>We contract for services, not for individuals. The companies with whom we contract have processes to deal with personnel issues. Federal employees can forward concerns to the Contracting Officer and/ or Contracting Officer's Representative, who are charged with communicating issues to the Contractor.<br /><br />Only authorized Contracting Officers and purchase card holders may solicit and negotiate services from contractors. The consequences of other individuals soliciting or negotiating services include additional documentation and delays as well as personal liability.</p>
<p>Contractor personnel may not perform inherently governmental functions. This means that federal employees cannot request or allow contractor personnel to perform the following:<br />&bull; Represent the government;<br />&bull; Supervise or direct federal employees;<br />&bull; Determine which supplies/services are to be purchased by the government;<br />&bull; Negotiate or obligate the government to pay for goods or services;<br />&bull; Determine federal program priorities, draft strategic plans; or<br />&bull; Perform other functions involving the exercise of discretion in applying governmental authority or value judgments.</p>
<p>Federal employees must ensure that the work stipulated in the contract is performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract. The contract defines the government's obligations and the contractor's responsibilities. Contractors do not have "other duties as assigned." Federal employees:<br />&bull; May not require, agree, or encourage performance of service outside scope of the contract;<br />&bull; May not request contractor personnel to perform prior to obligation of funding by the Contracting Officer;<br />&bull; May not perform the Contractor's work/obligations or provide Contractor personnel government resources (including other Contractor services), training, government owned vehicles, or supplies except as stipulated in the contract;<br />&bull; Shall ensure that hours/services required under the contract are provided;<br />&bull; Shall ensure that the government is billed properly for direct labor, which includes only time spent working on direct contract requirements. <br />&bull; Generally may not authorize contractor employees to bill direct labor for team building or other activities; and <br />&bull; May not put contractor employees in the position of taking unpaid leave in order to join and be viewed as part of the team.</p>
<p>Federal employees have a duty to conserve and protect government resources, and must ensure that government furnished property, facilities, and resources are used only for contract performance. Federal employees may not give preferential treatment or endorse any product, service, individual, or company. <br />Federal employees may not provide information to contractor employees except as required for contract performance and as authorized to distribute the information.<br />Contractors shall submit Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for information not necessary for performance set forth in the contract. Only Contracting Officers may release source selection information. Proprietary data being used by the Government may not be shared without the express or implied consent of the owner of the data.<br />Federal employees may not allow contractors to use the agency's name, seal, or acronym in connection with commercial activity unless approval is obtained. Contractor employees may not use government business cards or business cards that state or imply that they are federal employees.<br />Federal employees may never solicit gifts from contractor employees, and may not accept gifts (anything of value including local transportation) unless an exception to the gift rules applies. Federal employees may not accept contributions to group gifts from contractor employees.<br />Contractor personnel's use of government furnished property (government computers, telephones, etc.) is subject to the terms of the contract. Contractors may not use GFP for the following:<br />&bull; Outside business activities,<br />&bull; Personal activities, or<br />&bull; Soliciting/fundraising</p>
<p>Contractor personnel are required to identify themselves as contractors when they attend meetings, answer telephones, respond or send emails using a government/military address, or work in situations where their actions may be construed as acts of government officials.<br />Contractors may not represent the government or represent themselves as government employees. Contractors may not use government organizational occupational titles.</p>
<p>Federal employees may have professional relationships with contractor personnel, but if they have a close personal relationship (or financial interest), with the contractor employee, they may not give advice, make recommendations, or make decisions pertaining to the Contractor for whom the contractor person works.</p>
<p>Federal employees have a duty to report (promptly and accurately) adverse information about contractor performance. Federal employees must resolve all performance issues through the COR and Contracting Officer. The COR and</p>
<p>Contracting Officer have a duty to take appropriate contractual action. Federal employees have a duty to report improper and potentially criminal activity (ies) to the appropriate government office (Office of the Inspector General or OGC) and not to the Contractor.</p>
<p>Given the nature of the task requirements and the working environment, it may be necessary for government and contractor personnel to work as a team to accomplish work objectives, share knowledge, and work in a mutually supportive role. This should be accomplished while preserving the non-personal services nature of the task. The operational need to work in concert should be accomplished in a manner consistent with preserving the management responsibilities of the Contractor.</p>
<p>Working in a team environment, absent a designated contractor supervisor, may require the government to provide work direction to contractor personnel. Work direction means a communication to contractor personnel that directs or approves approaches, documents, presentations, or refinements to work; fills in details or otherwise completes the general description of work or documentation items; shifts emphasis among work areas or tasks; or furnishes similar instructions to contractor personnel. Work direction includes requiring analyses and development of administrative related products within the scope of work for the task.</p>
<p>The Contractor is at all times responsible for the quality of contractor personnel work. It is the direct responsibility of the Contractor to perform all tasks normally associated with an employer-employee relationship, e.g., completing time cards, resolving quality of work issues, ensuring high motivation and morale, and resolving government-identified contractor performance concerns. The physical absence of a contractor direct line supervisor does not relieve the Contractor of these responsibilities. <br />To ensure effective and efficient administration of duties, the contractor personnel need to establish and maintain work procedures that facilitate close and continuous coordination with agency Contracting Officers (CO), Project Officers (PO), and other Program Management (PM) personnel.<br />In addition, NCHS frequently responds to politically sensitive, high level support requirements with extremely short suspense actions. To function effectively and efficiently as a team member in this environment, the Contractor must ensure personnel provided possess a high degree of subject matter knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform the tasks relating to the objective. The Contractor supervision of Contractor personnel must also reflect the need to sustain a high-performing, highly motivated, and responsive team.</p>
<p>H. Smoke Free Working Environment (May 2009)</p>
<p>In compliance with Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regulations, all contractor personnel performing work within CDC/ATSDR facilities shall observe the CDC/ATSDR smoke-free working environment policy at all times. This policy prohibits smoking in all CDC/ATSDR buildings and in front of buildings which are open to the public. This policy is also applicable to contractor personnel who do not work full-time within CDC/ATSDR facilities, but are attending meetings within CDC/ATSDR facilities.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p>I. Release of Information</p>
<p>The program, this contract, any delivery/task order(s) issued under this contract, or actions as a result of this contract, pertain to a national security issue, and as such, all information is non-releasable. Any outside inquiries shall be immediately reported to the Government Contracting Officer for action.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall not, unless authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer or cognizant Project Officer or Technical Monitor, release or provide any information regarding work performed under this contract and any or all individual delivery/task orders issued against this contract.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p><br />J. FAR 52.216-1 Type of Contract (Apr 1984)</p>
<p>The Government contemplates award of a Performance Based Fixed Price Contract.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p><br />K. Non-Disclosure Agreements for Contractor and Contractor Employees - Mar 2006</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall prepare and submit a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to the Contracting Officer prior to access of government information or the commencement of work at CDC.</p>
<p>(b) The NDA made part of this clause, exhibit I and II, is required in service contracts where positions and/or functions proposed to be filled by contractor's employees will have access to non-public and procurement-sensitive information. The NDA also requires contractor's employees properly identify themselves as employees of a contractor when communicating or interacting with CDC employees, employees of other governmental entities (when communication or interaction relates to the contractor's work with the CDC), and members of the public. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 37.114 (c), states "All contractor personnel attending meetings, answering Government telephones, and working in other situations where their contractor status is not obvious to third parties are required to identify themselves as such to avoid creating an impression in the minds of members of the public or Congress that they are Government officials, unless, in the judgment of the agency, no harm can come from failing to identify themselves. They must also ensure that all documents or reports produced by contractors are suitably marked as contractor products or that contractor participation is appropriately disclosed."</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall inform employees of the identification requirements by which they must abide and monitor employee compliance with the identification requirements.</p>
<p>(d) During the contract performance period, the Contractor is responsible to ensure that all additional or replacement contractors' employees sign a NDA and it is submitted to the Contracting Officer prior to commencement of their work with the CDC.</p>
<p>(e) Contractor employees in designated positions or functions that have not signed the appropriate NDA shall not have access to any non-public, procurement sensitive information or participate in government meeting where sensitive information may be discussed.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor shall prepare and maintain a current list of employees working under NDAs and submit to the Contracting Officer upon request during the contract period of performance. The list should at a minimum include: contract number, employee's name, position, date of hire and</p>
<p>(g) NDA requirement.</p>
<p><br />L. Observance of Legal Holidays and Facility Closure (Government Facilities Performance) (Feb 2011)</p>
<p>(1) Holidays<br />Government personnel observe the following listed days as holidays:</p>
<p>Washington's Birthday<br />Memorial Day<br />Independence Day<br />Labor Day<br />Veterans' Day<br />Thanksgiving Day<br />Christmas Day<br />New Year's Day<br />Columbus Day<br />Martin Luther King Day</p>
<p>Any other day designated by Federal Statute<br />Any other day designated by Executive Order<br />Any other day designated by Presidential proclamation</p>
<p>For purposes of contract performance, the Contractor shall observe the above holidays on the date observed by the Government. Observance of such days shall not be cause for an additional period of performance or entitlement to compensation except as otherwise set forth in the contract. No form of holiday or other premium compensation will be reimbursed, however this does not preclude reimbursement for overtime work authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(2) Unscheduled Facility Closures</p>
<p>In the event Government facilities are closed due to inclement weather, potentially hazardous or unsafe conditions, or other special circumstances, contractor personnel assigned to work within those facilities are automatically dismissed. Notwithstanding the terms of this clause, the contractor shall comply with any specific contract terms that require a level of ongoing support for critical operations during times of facility closure. The contractor may also continue to provide support under a scheduled telework arrangement in accordance with the terms of the contract if the contract expressly authorizes telework in writing.</p>
<p>(3) Cost Impact</p>
<p>Accounting for costs associated with an unscheduled facility closure is unique to each contract and depends upon a number of factors such as:</p>
<p>&bull; Contract type, e.g. Fixed Price, Time and Materials, or Cost Reimbursement.<br />&bull; Contractor's established management and accounting practices for unproductive time.<br />&bull; The inclusion and applicability of other contract clauses.<br />&bull; The ability of the contractor to mitigate costs by reassigning employees to work on <br />other contracts, to work from a different facility, or to work remotely from home in accordance with contract telework provisions.<br />&bull; Whether the contractor works onsite</p>
<p>L. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 USC 794d) <br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) requires Federal agencies to purchase electronic and information technologies (EIT) that meet specific accessibility standards. All final deliverables must comply with applicable Section 508 accessibility standards, and CDC reserves the right to reject deliverables that fail to meet the standards. Remediation of any materials that do not comply with the applicable provisions of 36 CFR Part 1194 as set forth in the SOW or PWS, shall be the responsibility of the contractor or consultant retained to produce the Web- suitable content or communications material. Regardless of format, all electronic documents - including text, audio or video - must conform to applicable Section 508 standards to allow federal employees and members of the public with disabilities to access information that is comparable to information provided to persons without disabilities. <br />The following Section 508 provisions apply to the content or communications material identified in this SOW or PWS:<br />36 CFR 1194.22, .31, and .41<br />Documents must be in unlocked form. Acceptance checklists for various file formats are available at http://www.hhs.gov/web/508/index.html. <br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>SECTION 11 - PROJECT INFORMATION</p>
<p>The Contract Officer Representative (COR) for this procurement will be:</p>
<p><br />The Technical Monitor for this procurement will be:</p>
<p><br />SECTION 12 - Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)</p>
<p>The Contractor shall meet the requirements of the Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP).</p>
<p>1.0 Introduction</p>
<p>1.1 Since this is a Performance-Based Contract, the Government must effectively validate in a timely manner the performance of the Contractor in meeting the services required. This QASP provides a systematic surveillance method for the services, and describes the methodology by which the Contractor's performance will be monitored.</p>
<p>1.2 The principal focus of the surveillance system is the Contractor's performance of the indicators identified in the Performance-Based Matrix in Column 1 of the Performance Based Statement of Work (PBPWS). Therefore, the QASP surveillance standards are identical to those in IC.</p>
<p>1.3 This QASP will be used to provide surveillance for the task order.</p>
<p>1.4 For the purpose of this plan, AGENCY considers the FAR Clause 52.246-6 Inspection Time and Materials and Labor-Hour to meet the FAR Part 37.601 criteria for establishing a procedure for reduction of price or fee of a contract.</p>
<p>1.5 This QASP:</p>
<p>1.5.1 Identifies the services and products that will be measured.<br />1.5.2 Establishes the specific standards of performance for each required output.<br />1.5.3 Establishes the responsibilities for performing the measurement.<br />1.5.4 Defines the Government role in overseeing the performance.<br />1.5.5 Provides for feedback to the Contractor regarding quality, quantity, and timeliness of the service outputs.<br />1.5.6 Establishes timeframes for communicating performance improvements.</p>
<p>2.0 Methods of Surveillance</p>
<p>2.1 The Performance-Based Matrix lists the services to be monitored and the standards to be applied.</p>
<p>2.2 This QASP is based on the premise the Government desires to maintain a quality standard for acquisition support services.</p>
<p>2.3 The Contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the Government is quality assurance to ensure contract standards are achieved.</p>
<p>2.4 In this contract the Contractor quality control program is the basis for service quality. The Contractor is required to only deliver acquisition support services that conform to the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p>3.0 Roles and Responsibilities</p>
<p>3.1 The Contractor's primary responsibility is to ensure all requirements are met at the required quality level. The Government shall ensure this responsibility has been met before payment is made to the Contractor. The primary Government team members are the Contracting Officer's Technical Representatives (COTRs) and the Contracting Officer (CO).<br />3.2. The CO has the overall responsibility for overseeing the Contractor's performance. The CO is responsible for monitoring Contractor performance in the areas of contract compliance, contract management, and the resolution of all issues relative to the language of the contract.</p>
<p>3.3 The CORs are responsible for directly monitoring, assessing, recording, and reporting on the technical performance of the Contractor. The CORs will have primary responsibility for signing off on all invoices and documenting the inspection and evaluation of the Contractor's performance.</p>
<p>3.4 The CORs will work with staff and the Contractor to ensure good communication and resolve any problems not requiring the CO's authority.</p>
<p>4.0 Surveillance:</p>
<p>The PO will evaluate the performance objectives through periodic inspections during each service month.</p>
<p>4.1 The following information will be included:<br />4.1.1 Contract paragraph number referencing the requirement.<br />4.1.2 A short description of the requirement for which surveillance is to be undertaken.<br />4.1.3 Date, time, and location of surveillance.<br />4.1.4 Results of surveillance.<br />4.1.5 Signature of individual accomplishing the surveillance.<br />4.2 All performance must be documented, whether acceptable or unacceptable. When unacceptable performance is documented, the COTRs shall take the following actions:<br />4.2.1 If Government actions caused the unacceptable performance, take steps to prevent it in the <br />future.<br />4.2.2 If the Contractor's performance is unacceptable, inform the Contractor's representative of the unacceptable performance and the reasons why it is unacceptable.<br />4.2.3 If the Contractor wants to dispute the results of the surveillance, refer it to the CO for <br />resolution.<br />4.3 Performance should not be determined unacceptable until all possible contributing factors have been considered.<br />4.4 For required tasks not shown on the Performance-Based Matrix, the Government still retains the right to inspect any item included in the contract. These services will be inspected periodically and the results provided to the CO.</p>
<p>5.0 Standards<br />All standards in the Performance-Based Matrix must be met. All deliverable dates and other contractual completion dates must also be met. If any of the standards are not met, the Government shall receive consideration from the Contractor for breach of contract. <br />5.1 Late performance is inexcusable unless the Contractor can justify all of the following:<br />5.1.1 The delay was not the Contractor's fault.<br />5.1.2 The delay was not foreseeable.<br />5.1.3 It was beyond the Contractor's control to avoid the delay.<br />5.2 All work shall be performed in accordance with the Performance-Based Work Statement. The COR shall not consider the services complete until all deficiencies have been corrected.<br />5.3 The COR shall determine whether the failure was a minor non-conformance or a substantive non-conformance.</p>
<p>6.0 Procedures</p>
<p>The Government will inspect performance requirements to ensure contractor compliance and record results of inspection, noting the date and time of inspection. Unacceptable performance and complaints shall be referred to the CO for investigation and validation. The CO will investigate and validate the unacceptable performance and/or customer input. The Contractor shall be given a reasonable amount of time after notification to correct the unacceptable performance and report to the CO that the deficiency has been corrected. If deficiencies are not corrected, the PO will notify the CO and recommend a course of action.</p>
<p>7.0 Contract Performance Evaluation</p>
<p>7.1 FAR 42.15 - Contractor Performance Information establishes the Government's responsibility for recording and maintaining contractor performance information. This requirement does not apply to procedures used in determining incentive awards or other incentive systems, although the two systems should be mutually supporting.</p>
<p>7.2 FAR 42.1501 - Past performance information is relevant information for future source selection purposes, regarding a Contractor's actions under previously awarded contracts. It includes, for example, the Contractor's record of conforming to contract requirements and to standards of good workmanship; the Contractor's record of forecasting and controlling costs; the Contractor's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the Contractor's history of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the Contractor's business-like concern for the interest of the customers.</p>
<p><br />7.3 The general procedures to be used are addressed in the following FAR section.</p>
<p>42.1503 Procedures:</p>
<p>(a) Agency procedures for the past performance evaluation system shall generally provide for input to the evaluations from the technical office, contracting office and, where appropriate, end users of the product or service. (b) Agency evaluations of contractor performance prepared under this subpart shall be provided to the contractor as soon as practicable after completion of the evaluation. Contractors shall be given a minimum of 30 days to submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information. Agencies shall provide for review at a level above the CO to consider disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation. The ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency. Copies of the evaluation, contractor response, and review comments, if any, shall be retained as part of the evaluation. These evaluations may be used to support future award decisions, and should therefore be marked "Source Selection Information".</p>
<p>All data files, reports, and correspondence should be submitted to the CDC Contracting Officers Representative (COR) via email. Deliverables will include a monthly comprehensive report on the status of the project.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p>VIII. Contract Officer Representative and Technical Monitor<br />The Contract Officer Representative will be:</p>
<p>The Project Officer for this procurement is:</p>
<p><br />SECTION XII ----- PAYMENT TERMS (note if and how partial payments are allowed).</p>
<p>Payment will be made in accordance with the line items established herein and in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, Prompt Payment, which states that the due date for making invoice payments shall be the 30th day after the designated billing office (see block 21 of the order) has received a proper invoice from the vendor or the 30th day after Government acceptance of the services performed by the vendor, whichever is later.</p>
<p>This contract action is for a services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 41 U.S.C 3304(a) (1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. <br />The notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be e-mailed to purchasing agent Rebecca Mullenax at rmullenax@cdc.gov by COB on May 11, 2018.</p>

Palantir licenses its software to CDC to support surveillance and outbreak activities. They provide software updates, patches, maintenance and support. Palantir has intimate knowledge and expertise with the development of the core modules on the Palantir platform. This makes them uniquely qualified to provide licenses, software components, modifications and enhancements to the Palantir product. Additionally, Palantir has specific proprietary knowledge regarding the Palantir platform hardware, system configurations, performance settings, etc. Award of the task to a different vendor will result in significant costs to the government and unacceptable delays due to rework.<br />Competition would cause significant delays for the current Palantir project, including an application to support the current Emergency Operation Center (EOC) responses. Delays would directly affect the ability of CDC to deploy staff during emergency response. Palantir has proven expertise to support and extend the extensive CDC customization and enhancement. It will require a significant time, effort, and cost to re-implement CDC workflows, customizations, and migrate data to a new vendor's product. The increased project risks, delays and costs from the loss of the Palantir's experience makes it critical that we retain the continuity of expertise, technology and consistency in operations that only they can provide. It is critical for Palantir to continue to provide licenses, technical support and enhancements for the CDC Palantir software to avoid any loss of continuity that would disrupt CDC's critical Public Health surveillance and outbreak programs.

<RESPDATE>051018
<CONTACT>Sarah Turner, Email KWP9@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Carestream Health, Inc. for the purchase of annual maintenance services for existing Carestream Digital X-ray Systems. These services are required to keep the existing Digital X-ray systems functional and up to date; no other vendors meet this requirement. This service maintains the operational readiness of critical mobile medical equipment used to provide chest X-ray services. The X ray systems are currently installed in two NIOSH mobile medical units, which provide chest X-rays to miners throughout the US mining communities. These services are a vital part of NIOSH's Enhanced Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program. It is imperative that the X-ray systems are maintained, properly serviced, and continually functional. Service and maintenance from vendors other than the manufacturer would jeopardize the system and void the manufacturer's warranty. Only Carestream Health is authorized to maintain the Digital X-ray Systems. No other entities or individuals receive the extensive training required for maintaining and repairing, except Carestream Health service engineers. This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (SAP) and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within five (5) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to contract specialist at kwp9@cdc.gov by 10 May 2018.</p>

<DESC>DLA Aviation at Philadelphia will solicit a proposal for the acquisition of performance based logistics and engineering support, as follows: 12 Integrated Product Support (IPS) Elements for all United States Navy (USN), United States Marine Corps (USMC) and, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Cases for: Spain, Canada, Switzerland, Malaysia, Kuwait, Australia, and Finland Fighter/Attack F/A 18A F and Electronic Attack EA 18G Type/Model/Series (T/M/S) aircraft. Efforts are for support directly related to hardware that is procured on various F/A-18 and EA-18G contracts. The IPS Elements have the word "integrated" specifically included in the name to reinforce the approach of constructing the product support infrastructure to ensure all functional areas are mutually supporting and non-duplicative in terms of funding, usage of resources (both personnel and materiel), capability, and outcomes. Each of the 12 Elements becomes a "force multiplier" to add value (either through improving outcomes or reducing life cycle costs) across the entire scope of weapon system support.<br />The contractor will be required to provide the following IPS Element or combination of elements supports the production of a plan, process, or specific product, which in term contributes to the successful acquisition, operation, and support of the weapon system. The 12 IPS elements are: Product Support Management, Technical Data, Design Interface, Support Equipment, Sustaining Engineering, Support Equipment, Training and Training Support, Supply Support, Maintenance Planning Management, Manpower &amp; Personnel, Facilities and Infrastructure, Computer Resources, and Packaging, Handling Storage, &amp; Transportation<br />This effort contemplated to be procured from Boeing, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, will be required to provide comprehensive support of the program. The Boeing Company is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of these aircrafts with design control, authorization, and documentation to manufacture. The Boeing Company owns the limited data rights to these items. The Government does not have the drawings or complete data packages. The contract is planned as a Fixed Price action against the BCOI contract, which is strategic in nature and will be the primary vehicle for procurement of a wide range of supplies.
<p>Performance will include a total performance period of five years. The scope of work covers the base period Calendar Year 2019 and Option Calendar Years 2020-2024 Packaging, Handling Storage, &amp; Transportation.</p>

<p>Occupant Crash Protection Compliance Testing to FMVSS No. 208, 212, 219, 301 and 305</p>
<p>Synopsis</p>
<p>This synopsis, in accordance with FAR 5.203(a), issues a 15-day public notification prior to the issuance of solicitation 693JJ918R000031.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to issue a solicitation for a Full and Open Competition in support of the NHTSA Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance (OVSC) compliance testing and investigation effort.</p>
<p>Introduction and Background</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an integral part of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and its mission is to save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce economic costs associated with motor vehicle crashes.  As part of its mission to reduce fatalities and injuries caused by motor vehicle crashes, the NHTSA promulgates Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS).  Manufacturers of motor vehicles and items of motor vehicle equipment are required to certify that each product they sell in the United States meets the requirements of all applicable safety standards.</p>
<p>NHTSA's Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance (OVSC) is charged with determining whether manufacturers meet all applicable safety standards.  Under the compliance test program, the OVSC selects vehicles and items of motor vehicle equipment for compliance testing by qualified independent testing laboratories.  OVSC relies upon the data and analyses generated by the testing to determine whether vehicle manufacturers' self-certifications are valid.</p>
<p>This proposed contract effort will enable the agency to meet its mission by assuring that motor vehicles meet the requirements of the safety standards.</p>
<p>Scope of Work</p>
<p>To accomplish the objectives of this procurement, the Contractor will be required to furnish qualified technical personnel, facilities and equipment to perform inspection and compliance testing services, to determine conformance of motor vehicles to the requirements of the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	FMVSS No. 208 - Occupant Crash Protection, <br />&bull;	FMVSS No. 212 - Windshield Mounting, <br />&bull;	FMVSS No. 219 - Windshield Zone Intrusion, <br />&bull;	FMVSS No. 301 - Fuel System Integrity (Frontal),<br />&bull;	FMVSS No. 305 - Electric Powered Vehicles; electrolyte spillage and electrical shock protection.</p>
<p>The Government will provide the Contractor with the test vehicles, anthropomorphic test devices (crash test dummies) without instrumentation, and child restraint systems as Government Furnished Property (GFP).</p>
<p>Each GFP test vehicle shall undergo various static testing along with a full scale, dynamic crash test.</p>
<p>FMVSS Nos. 212, 219, 301 and 305 compliance tests shall be performed in conjunction with the full scale dynamic crash test as specified in the OVSC Test Procedure, TP-208-14 (Occupant Crash Protection).</p>
<p>Prior to the full scale, dynamic crash tests, numerous low risk, static deployment tests and/or inflatable restraint suppression tests, along with other passenger restraint systems tests, may be performed.  After each intermediate, low risk, and static deployment test, the Contractor will be required to procure from a dealer, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) parts to repair the vehicle to new condition.  The Contractor will also be required to obtain approval from the NHTSA Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) to either, perform the repair in-house, or have the dealer perform the repair.  In preparation for the full scale, dynamic crash test, the Contractor will be required to have the GFP test vehicle transported to and repaired by a dealer after the completion of testing.</p>
<p>Note: Dealer is defined as a franchise associated with the OEM of the GFP test vehicle and authorized by the OEM to perform repairs.</p>
<p>Upon request of the Government, the Contractor may be required to purchase additional child restraint systems for the compliance tests.  Child restraint systems must be stored/secured in an environmentally controlled storage area/facility.</p>
<p>Contract Type, Period of Performance, and NAICS Code</p>
<p>NHTSA intends to award one Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, whereby Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Orders (with Cost Reimbursement elements for towing, parts, and dealer repairs, vehicle repairs, child restraints, and battery removal) will be issued in accordance with FAR 16.5.</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance is 60-Months, inclusive of one (1) Base Year and four (4) Option Years to be exercised at the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this anticipated contract is 541380 (Testing Laboratories) with a size standard of $15M.</p>
<p>Place of Performance/Physical Location</p>
<p>The work performed under the proposed Contract and any Delivery Orders issued under the Contract shall be accomplished at the Contractor's facilities and those facilities shall be located within the continental United States.  There shall be no deviation from or waiver of this requirement.</p>
<p>System for Award Management Registration</p>
<p>Contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database located at www.sam.gov in order to receive an award in response to the solicitation.</p>
<p><br />THIS NOTICE OF SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  This notice is for informational purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.<br />The solicitation will be released electronically via this Government Point of Entry (GPE) otherwise known as Federal Business Opportunities or www.fbo.gov.  As such, no written, telephonic or other type of request for an advance copy of the solicitation will be entertained.  Potential offerors/vendors are encouraged to register on www.fbo.gov to receive any further information in reference to the subject action inclusive of any announcements, and/or amendments to the solicitation after its release.</p>

<DESC><strong>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD ON A SOLE SOURCE BASIS.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE/PROPOSALS. </strong>
<p>The NINDS Contracts Management Section of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), intends to solicit on a sole-source basis by a request for quotation to 10x Genomics Inc. on or around May 3, 2018 with an award issued on or around May 11, 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of the resultant purchase order will be to provide the Spinal Circuits and Plasticity Unit of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) with a dedicated 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell/Nucleus Encapsulation and Barcoding System to continue research that has utilized this identical system at the National Institutes of Health main campus in Bethesda, MD.  This particular 10x Genomics Inc. system is needed in order to maintain the scientific integrity of previously generated research data, which has utilized this same equipment.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE and SET ASIDE STATUS</p>
<p>The intended procurement is classified under <strong>NAICS code 334516</strong>, "Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing" with a Size Standard of 1,000 employees or fewer.</p>
<p><strong>This acquisition is NOT set aside for small businesses, but rather is a sole-source acquisition to 10x Genomics Inc..</strong></p>
<p><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY </strong><br />This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements. FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b) Soliciting from a single source provides that: For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, Contracting Officers may solicit from one source IF the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name OR industrial mobilization).</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF REQUIREMENT</strong></p>
<p>The mission of the Spinal Circuits and Plasticity Unit is to reveal the molecular, cellular, and circuit basis of plasticity within the spinal cord. As part of that mission the Unit recently completed a study to sequence the RNA from hundreds to low thousands of spinal cord nuclei and use bio-informatic analysis of this data to classify each nucleus and identify the constituent populations of the spinal cord. The Unit now plans to apply this technology to study spinal cord injury and must use a highly reliable set-up for isolating several thousand of single nuclei per sample. The Unit has performed two experiments using the 10X Chromium system (borrowed from the NIDCD core facility) and obtained excellent quality data. To continue this work, the Unit needs to procure its own system (instrument and consummables for 20 samples) for massively parallel single nucleus transcriptional profiling.</p>
<p><br /><strong>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION</strong></p>
<p>Research to be perfomed by the Spinal Circuits and Plasticity Unit utilizing this equipment will be follow-on research to previous and on-going research projects which utilized a 10X Genomics Chromium system (housed in a separate building on the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD).

<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT <br />Project Description, Background and Purpose<br />The Contractor is to provide an extended warranty as well as perform a preventative maintenance (PM) on the Hamamatsu FDSS7000EX kinetic plate reader platform which is integrated onto the Tox robot. The FDSS is a complex piece of equipment that provides the means to collect kinetic data for high throughput screening assays looking at intracellular calcium ion, membrane potential and more. This has greatly expanded the assay capabilities for the Tox21 group and others at NCATS especially with it being integrated onto a robotic platform allowing high throughput screening of small and larger chemical compound libraries. It is imperative that this piece of equipment is covered under and extended warranty which covers hardware replacement and a preventative maintenance visit. Having the extended warranty and PM will ensure the device and all of its components will be repaired in a timely manner when necessary minimizing down time therefore allowing the important research to continue uninterrupted. Hamamatsu has also completed some customizations which NCATS requested in order to have the device operate in the fashion NCATS requires. <br />The Contractor will provide the extended warranty and preventative maintenance (PM) visits for 1 year (with 2 additional option years) including hardware replacement. It will also cover upgrades made since installation. The maintenance will encompass inspection and adjustments where needed of the plate image for any shift, head/tip mounting position, stage/wash/loader tip alignment positions and wash station. The Contractor will inspect and lubricate where needed including door movement and alignment and guide rails and lead screws. The Contractor will inspect the wash tubing for fluid leaks and will replace where needed.</p>
<p>DELIVERY SCHEDULE/PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />The Period of Performance is for 12 months starting within 10 days after the purchase order is awarded, with 2 subsequent yearly option periods. If the options are exercised, the Contractor will continue to provide these same services as in the base year, for each option year.</p>
<p>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:<br />&bull; Preventative Maintenance (PM) performed within each of the 12 month contract periods <br />&bull; Service visits to include labor and travel<br />&bull; Unlimited Phone Support <br />&bull; Eight (8)-hour phone response Monday through Friday, excluding evenings and holidays<br />&bull; Service hours Monday - Friday, 8AM to 5PM excluding holidays<br />&bull; Parts/response priority, typically within 48-72 hours or sooner of the initial call <br />&bull; Detailed reports of service performed will be provided.<br /><br />CLOSING STATEMENT<br />This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.

The proposed contract will require the development of an engineering change to modify the existing LBT system to improve performance and increase reliability of the highly specialized VPOL Antenna System currently in use and will include the design, manufacture, integration, and test of the VPOL Antenna Assembly. The effort will also require delivery of five test articles to support future qualification and testing of the VPOL Antenna Assembly, as well as applicable technical data. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."

The term of the contract is expected to be approximately twelve months. This is not a commercial buy and therefore the Government does not intend to use the provisions of FAR Part 12 for this acquisition. This synopsis is published for informational purposes only.

<p>The Government has a requirement for AN/VLQ-13(V)1 &amp; (V)2 CVRJ Countermeasure repairs, spares, and engineering services to be procured from Impact Sciences &amp; Technologies, 84 Northwest Blvd. Suite B, Nashua, NH. It is anticipated this action will result in a five-year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA). The unpriced BOA will have a ceiling of $5,700,000. The statement of work within the BOA covers Program Management Support, Systems Engineering Support, Field Service Representatives, Equipment Support, Depot operations Repair Services, and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) support. This effort will be negotiated on a sole source basis with Impact Science &amp; Technologies in accordance with the authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The basis for restricting competition is duplication of cost to the Government in approving a new source would not be recouped through competition and the Government does not have unlimited rights to the technical data package. A competitive procurement approach would require extensive cost duplication for non-recurring engineering and product validation and an unacceptable delay in schedule to meet requirement needs.</p>

Responsible sources may submit inquiries or a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency by 24 May 2018.
