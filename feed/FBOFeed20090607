Now that summer time is upon us, it is imperative that the system is brought back to life.

In order to simplify the data integration process and provide enhanced workflow and data visibility, DoD is investigating new technologies.  Areas of particular interest include:<BR><BR>"	Data integration solutions that employ metadata-driven transformations and/or adaptations that ensure metadata are visible, accessible and understandable.<BR>"	Integration patterns that decouple transformations and adaptations from business logic and business rules.<BR>"	Message broker capabilities including data routing (content-based addressing), publish & subscribe and other message brokering functions.<BR>"	Mediation capabilities for protocol adaptation.<BR>"	Other capabilities in a technology stack for the purpose of mediating data between two or more IT components.<BR>"	Adherence to Open Standards where possible and effective.<BR><BR>Requested Information:<BR>Interested vendors shall submit their knowledge and capabilities to perform each of the requirements outlined below.   If the respondent focuses on a particular piece of technology that addresses a single area, the respondent should make it clear how this technology contributes to the overall program/process. <BR><BR>1.

Semantic-based Mediation - The capability to mediate between systems based on semantics.  A semantic-based mediation is a data model that represents a set of concepts within a domain and the relationship between those concepts including, but not limited to:<BR><BR>-	RDF - Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a model for representing metadata in XML. <BR>-	OWL  Web Ontology Language (OWL) facilitates greater machine interpretability of Web content than that supported by XML, RDF, and RDF Schema (RDF-S) by providing additional vocabulary along with a formal semantics. <BR>-	SWRL - Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) based on a combination of the OWL DL and OWL Lite sublanguages of the OWL Web Ontology Language with the Unary/Binary Datalog RuleML sub-languages of the Rule Markup Language.<BR>-	Other identified standard or protocol<BR><BR>3.	Mapping based Mediation - The capability to mediate between systems based on mappings between the data models of those systems including, but not limited to:<BR><BR>-	Cross-walks<BR>-	Reference tables<BR>-	Provide output as:<BR>o	XSL<BR>o	XQuery <BR>o	OWL<BR>o	Code <BR>o	Other<BR>-	Import:<BR>o	XSL<BR>o	XQuery <BR>o	Other<BR><BR>4.

Security, Encryption and Digital Signature - The capability to provide an Information Assurance shell of data so as to address consumption of data by the unanticipated consumer.  This includes all IA aspects as well as data encryption and digital signature for exchanges including,  but not limited to:<BR><BR>-	 WS-Security (Web Services Standards)<BR>-	 Security Encryption and Digital Signature<BR>-	 Process to ensure the fidelity of information<BR>-	 Other<BR><BR>7.	Rules Engine Support - Capability to provide support for a rules engine which allows the separation of processing logic of business rules from data storage specific to the management of business rules data including, but not limited to:<BR><BR>-	 Standards/protocols to be identified<BR>-	 Other<BR><BR>8.

Performance, Scalability and Reliability - The extent to which an echnology used by a program in data integration can be scaled to support all anticipated and unanticipated consumers.  Includes non-material solutions put in place by the program to address reliability issues including, but not limited to:<BR><BR>-	 Hardware-based Load Balancing<BR>-	 Software-based Load Balancing<BR>-	 Clustering<BR>-	 COOP Strategy (continuity of operations planning)<BR><BR>Other.<BR><BR>Submission Instructions and Format<BR><BR>Submission shall be no more than 15 pages, excluding cover sheet, single-spaced, 8.5 x 11 paper, 1 inch margin, and no smaller than 12 point type and compatible with MS Office Word or Adobe PDF format.
