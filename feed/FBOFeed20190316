LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
A.  Contractor shall be liable to the Government for losses of production due to significant equipment downtime.  Significant equipment downtime is that which exceeds twenty-four (24) hours/month. Records regarding downtime will be kept by the COR and the maintenance contractor.
 
B.  Equipment downtime is calculated only from those normal hours of coverage (see Hours of Coverage Section) that the scheduled equipment is not fully operational.  Downtime will begin when the Contractor is required to be on site (see Unscheduled Maintenance Section response time definition) after notification by the CO, COR or designated alternate.  Downtime will accumulate until the scheduled equipment is returned to full and usual operation and accepted as such by the CO, COR or designated alternate.  This does not include scheduled maintenance for PM purposes or when waiting for VA furnished tubes.  Refusal of access to the equipment indicates that the unit is up and running and this time will not be considered when determining downtime.  Refusal of access to the equipment voids the service call.
 
C.  If downtime exceeds thirty-three (33) consecutive hours, the CO may exercise the option to hire an alternate source to resolve the problem.  The decision to exercise this alternative will reside exclusively with the CO.  All fees generated by the alternate Contractor(s) will be handled in accordance with Default clause.
 
D. Monies will be subtracted from the contract if the Contractor fails to meet the up-time requirements using the following formula:
 
MONTHLY                                   MONTHS
DOWNTIME
23 - 24 hours/month                            0%
25 - 26 hours/month                          20%
27 - 28 hours/month                          40%
29 - 30 hours/month                          60%
31 - 32 hours/month                          80%
33 or more hours/month                 100%
These will be computed for the monthly dollar totals.
E. Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any damage done to Government property caused by themselves or their employees.
