This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the ImageTrac Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. CA/CST requires the ImageTrac Scanner as the U.S. Passport application process is a paper-based process with a variety of different document types being scanned.  IBML systems provide unique paper track handling for the Passport environment and have proven reliable and technologically advanced in the marketplace over the past 10 years.  CA/CST/PS has chosen the IBML system for the following reasons: -	No other vendor has demonstration the ability to handle the unique needs of the Passport scanning environment, which includes scanning packets that can include applications, supporting documentation such as an old Passport, FedEx envelopes, etc. -	IBML scanners are uniquely able to process, at high speed, the wide variety of documents Passport scans including documents with staples. -	IBML scanners are already integrated with Passportýs key systems and support infrastructure from an operations and maintenance perspective. -	The IBML technology has been a reliable component of the Passport Systems architecture for almost 10 years. -	IBML has continued to work with CST to assure that the scanning platforms remain compatible with Passport-specific needs -	IBML can support the time constraints to deliver the equipment to DoS, as well as the custom software tools (API) to control scanner elements from within TDIS -	Changing scanner technology would incur a length integration, test, and certification cycle which is currently untenable for the business. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The United States Government intends to award a lease extension, using other than full and open competition to Northwestern Capital Corporation.  The extension will be for 12,906 rentable square feet of fully serviced office space and five structured parking spaces for a term of eighteen (18) months.

The government has a continuing need for this space until such time as a competitive lease can be awarded.  It has been determined that an extension will result in less cost to the federal government when economies of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration as an economic factor.  

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the government?s intent to award this project under Other than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Andrea Cooney, Realty Specialist, at andrea.cooney@gsa.gov or to her attention at GSA, Property Acquisition & Realty Services Division (4PEC), Atrium West Building, 7771 West Oakland Park Boulevard, Suite 119, Sunrise, Florida 33351.  Any written comments are to be received within ten (10) days of the publication of this notice.

Responses are due by the close of business January 23, 2008.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Notice of Proposed Contract Action (NOCA), by the 950th Electronic Systems Group (950 ELSG), Hanscom AFB, MA, for a noncompetitive follow-on contract for Radarsat 2 Software Upgrade to be negotiated with McDonald Dettwiler Associates (MDA) of Canada. The new contract for the final effort, Radarsat 2 Phase 2 Capability, will provide the enhancement of the Radarsat 2 Imagery Product Generation capability with updated software components to allow the reception of Radarsat 2 data and the automated interface with other Eagle Vision processing elements.  The basic Radarsat 2 Imagery Product Generation capability has been tested using predicted satellite data and now requires an update to incorporate actual satellite performance after which the system will be retested and then the software and software licenses will be accepted by the Government.  MDA has the exclusive license to develop, market, and produce the downlink reception and processing algorithms and systems, and is therefore the only contractor able to perform the requested effort.   Please submit responses via e-mail to diane.oneil@hanscom.af.mil, Barbara.fedele@hanscom.af.mil and Daniel.urban@hanscom.af.mil no later than 2:00 PM EST, 23 January 2008.

This synopsis is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The information you provide will be evaluated to identify qualified potential offerors.  ESC will not release to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government, any information marked with a proprietary legend without the written permission from the respondent. The Government will not pay for any information received in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government compensate a respondent for any costs incurred in developing the information provided to ESC.

It is the former US Navy facility at the Federal Research Center Naval Ordinance Laboratory at White Oak, Silver Spring, MD.  Five (5) phases are planned in total, with phasing summary as follows:  Phase 1 - Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Laboratory Facility (111,250 gsf) completed in October 2003;  Phase 2 - Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) Office Building (551,247 gsf);  Phase 3 - Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Laboratory and Offices (1,117,216 gsf);  Phase 4 - Office of Commissioner (OC) & Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) (455,796 gsf).  and Phase 5 - Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Laboratory and Offices (879,073 gsf); Contractor must provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided) and must plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective performance of all construction to meet GSA and client agency requirements.  Contractor will perform the superstructure construction in accordance with the design specifications, drawings and terms and conditions of the contract.  Estimated construction cost range is between $15 - $25 million.  NAICS Code is 236220.  Construction Performance Period shall not exceed nine (9) months.  Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 15.3.  Contract will be Firm Fixed Price.  Award of the contract is subject to the availability of funds.
"Best Value Continuum, Tradeoff Process" is the method that will be used to evaluate price and other factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance, quality and pricing.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers most for the money, without necessarily basing selection on the lowest price.
The following are submission requirements and Technical Evaluation Factors:
I.	EXPERIENCE (35%).
1).	Offeror must demonstrate its past organizational experience as a General Construction (GC) Contractor responsible for the construction of at least two (2) concrete framed office or garage projects within the past ten (10) years, which is comparable in nature, type, and complexity to the project in this solicitation. 
2)	Offeror may demonstrate its experience as a General Construction (GC) 

II.	PAST PERFORMANCE (20%).  This factor considers the extent of the past performance of the offeror with reference to such aspects as costs, timeliness, and technical success as part of the consideration.  

III.	KEY PERSONNEL (10%). This factor considers the qualifications of key personnel proposed by the offeror to execute the contract requirements for the positions proposed.  
IV.	MANAGEMENT PLAN & SCHEDULE (20%).  This factor considers the plan being proposed by the offeror to execute the work contained in the contract drawings and specifications.  
V.	SUBCONTRACTING PLAN (5%).  This solicitation is not set-aside for small business.  However, this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  This procurement is open to small and large business concerns.  Women-Owned Businesses are encouraged to submit a technical proposal and so state that they are Women-Owned.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the agency.
General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance.  GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment.  Before award of the contract, the firm (if not a small business) shall be required to present an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 19.7.  If selected for award, the subcontracting plan of the offeror should be ready for approval without the need to obtain additional information.  All interested large business firms are reminded to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and disadvantaged firms as part of their original submitted teams.  
VI.	APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM (10%):  The Government will evaluate the means by which the Offeror shall promote the growth of skilled craft labor, specifically the contractor's use of a registered apprenticeship program.  (As used herein, the term "registered apprenticeship program" is a program that is registered with the United States Department of Labor or State Apprenticeship Council under 29 CFR Part 29.)  The requirements of FAR 52.219-9 must be followed explicitly.
General Services Administration will only make the RFP available electronically at www.eps.gov.  GSA intends to upload the RFP at this site on or about January 25, 2008.

5.1 ? Aircrew Services Requirement



The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Patuxent River, Maryland, Naval Test Wing Atlantic (NTWL) and Naval Test Wing Pacific (NTWP) of the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), has a requirement to procure aircrew and flight support services.  The requirement will include labor, travel and material necessary to sustain the PSOW.

 The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Wyle Laboratories, Inc., 7800 Highway 20 West, Huntsville, AL, under the authority for other than full and open competition, Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(c)(1) and implemented via  Federal Acquisition Regulations   Subpart 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This is not a request for proposal.  Interested parties may submit a capability statement to the Government for the purpose of determining whether to challenge the sole source requirement. The Government will consider all capability statements received in response to this notice.  The Government reserves the right to process this procurement as a sole source based on the responses received.   An award is anticipated no later than 1 April 2008.  The period of performance will be for a base year plus four one-year options, for a total of five years of performance.  The appropriate NAICS is 541330, and the size standard is $4.5 million.  This requirement is to provide aircrew and flight support for the NTWL/NTWP squadrons.  Flight support consists of pilots to fly the aircraft as directed by the Government.  The squadrons are responsible for the overall operations, scheduling, and safety of naval aircraft.  In support of this charter, the squadrons (VX-20, HX-21, VX-30, VX-31, and Test Pilot School) require contractor operations, scheduling, engineering and aircrew support. Each squadron platform coordinator has an Operations and Scheduling division. The complexity of today's flight test scenarios in the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) community and the constant changes that are associated with RDT&E flying requires constant monitoring, scheduling, frequency management and flight operations coordination. With the unique type of flying associated with RDT&E, there are unique safety considera?tions on both the squadron level and the platform office level.  This support enables the squadrons to provide test and evaluation, technical advice, and assistance to NAVAIR, Naval Technical Assurance Board (NTAB), and other Government agencies.  Required tasking for this effort may include, but is not necessarily limited to, the above.  NOTE:  A DD254, Contract Security Classification Specification, shall be applicable to this requirement.  The current level of classification has been identified as TOP SECRET facility and NONE for safeguarding.  DFARS 252.204-7004 Alternate A, Required Central Contractor Registration, applies to all solicitations issued on/after 6/1/98. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Please ensure compliance with this registration when submitting your statement. Call 1-888-227-2423 or view at http://www.ccr.gov/ for more information. Furthermore, the contractor awardee shall be required to self-register at https://wawf.eb.mil to ensure compliance and utilization of Wide Area Workflow (WAWF).  FAR 52.204-8 requires that each offeror complete the annual representations and certifications electronically via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website at http://www.bpn.gov.  Each offeror shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Alt 1, Offeror Representations and Certifications ?

This procurement will be issued using the Authority of the Test Program for Commercial Items, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996.  Use of the listed ECS Composites products fulfills the following requirements:  ECS Composites is the provider of custom made equipment transit cases for DJC2.

These items currently fit within a specific location in the load plan, and are tested and fielded parts of the system.  While there are other hardware components that would fulfill the form, fit, and functionality of these items, these items are currently an approved part of the system configuration.  Also, most ECS Composites transit cases have been custom designed for specific pieces of equipment in the DJC2 system.  As it stands, ECS Composites provide the majority of the transit cases for DJC2 equipment.  In an effort to minimize the impacts to configuration management and procurement lead time, ECS Composites should be the chosen vendors for the infrastructure support equipment listed in the table.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     This is a Request for Quotation (RFQ); the solicitation number is N61331-08-T-1732.     The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to award on a Sole Source basis a firm-fixed price purchase order to Comark Corporation, 93 West Street, Medfield, Massachusetts 02052.     This procurement will be issued using the Authority of the Test Program for Commercial Items, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. This acquisition is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The U.S. Navy has conducted a qualification program for manufacturers of LCAC SIUs and has determined that it is necessary to purc!  hase the same units for the remaining SLEP craft.     This qualification program involved extensive testing to ensure 100 percent compatibility with the LCAC navigation systems. Currently, the SIU, manufactured by Comark Corporation, has been installed on all completed SLEP. This sensor system, as previously installed, is integrated into the SLEP navigation hardware and software that will form the basis for the SLEP replacement gear.     Any other sensor system would require extensive re-development and testing costs that could not be recovered through competition. It is essential that the SIUs on the remaining SLEP LCACs be identical to the current SLEP sensor systems to ensure the logistics chain established for the SLEP LCACs can be reused. Comark Corporation as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) is uniquely qualified to provide these items. The following is being procured:     CLIN 0001 Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Sensor Interface Units (SIU) Part Number 51-!  27840-001, QTY (32) NAICS Code 334111 applies.

<SUBJECT>F--Long Term Wild Horse Holding Facility Located within the Continental U.S.
<SOLNBR>NAR080053
<RESPDATE>022508
<ARCHDATE>01082009
<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for a pasture facility located within the continental U.S. to maintain up to 2,500 wild horses for one year, with 4 additional one year option periods.  The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for each Wild Horse & Burro Holding Facility: Wild horses and burros on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331 1340).  As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses and burros are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt A Horse program.  Horses that have not been adopted because of age or other factors are being cared for on private land.  Some of the horses that have not been adopted because of age or other factors are currently being cared for by Reed Brothers in Foraker, Oklahoma.  The purpose of this contract is to continue the maintenance of these animals for the remainder of their lives.  The possibility exists that more unadoptable animals will be removed from the range and transported to the facility.  This is not the preferred management method for these animals.  However, on occasion it will be necessary to place animals at the facility, on an as needed basis.  It is the intent of the BLM that the number of animals at the facility will decline during the period of this contract. On  December 8, 2004 Public Law 108-341; Section 142 amended the 1971 Wild and Free-roaming Horses and Burros Act (Public Law 92-195) that requires the BLM to sell excess wild horses and burros which meet the following criteria: Animals that are 11 years of age and older; or Animals that have been offered unsuccessfully at three adoptions. This may require the BLM to remove animals that meet the above criteria from the contracted facility during the course of the contract.  All animals that are in too poor of health to be prepared or transported will be released back to the pastures or humanely destroyed to avoid undue suffering.  All wild horses that do not meet the above criteria will remain in a free-roaming environment.  The horses currently being maintained at the Foraker, Oklahoma facility are a non-reproductive herd consisting of primarily older geldings.  It is anticipated that in the beginning only a few older horses will be shipped into the facility, but the number may increase as the contract continues.  The horses maintained for long term will be a non reproductive herd consisting of primarily older horses in the age range of 6 to 30 years old.  As horses die or are removed for adoption, it is possible that they may not be replaced with additional horses.  Therefore, the number of horses may decline during the life of the contract.  Objectives - To maintain excess wild horses on private land in pastures that are large enough to allow free roaming behavior and that can provide the food, water, hoof care and shelter necessary to sustain the animals in good condition; In the long-term holding, to minimize handling of wild horses by humans and sorting of the animals through chutes, gates, and corrals; To provide pasture and semi-free roaming behavior in the younger, adoptable animals, or sale animals until they are shipped to an adoption; Provide humane care of the younger, adoptable animals or sale animals that are held a minimum of 30 days prior to shipment.  All horses that are gathered for adoption will be held in small pastures or corrals for at least 30 days prior to shipment; Provide humane care during receiving, holding, preparing and shipment of horses; Provide regular, on the ground monitoring of the wild horses to ascertain their well-being and safety; Provide management by individuals who are knowledgeable and experienced about the behavior and nutritional requirements of equines and the management of land for the sustained production of grass and other desirable forage plants. General Services - The contractor shall provide all necessary land, facilities, personnel, and supplies to perform the following general tasks.  Facility: Provide land, forage, shelter, salt, minerals, water, and fences necessary to properly care for a maximum of 2,500 geldings.  Provide supplemental feed as necessary to maintain the horses in good condition; Pastures: Pastures or combination of pastures must be of a size adequate to encourage free-roaming behavior in a natural setting;   Pastures will be adjacent to and served by a corral/working facility capable of holding 300 wild horses and burros.  The corral/working and pasture facilities will be designed for ease of movement, sorting and restraining wild horses for a minimum of 30 days when holding younger, adoptable animals or sale animals awaiting shipment. Provide corrals and adequate facilities to load and unload wild horses; Load, unload, sort, and segregate the BLM delivered wild horses upon their arrival at the site; Gather and hold younger, adoptable animals or sale animals for a minimum of 30 days until time for shipment to adoptions; Provide corrals, chutes, and adequate facilities to vaccinate, deworm and draw blood samples for younger, adoptable animals prior to shipment for adoptions; Gather and move horses from pasture to pasture as needed, supervise their health and welfare, provide supplementary feed as needed and maintain the facilities in a safe condition; Provide regular monitoring (at least once a week) of horses on site and a record keeping system that documents the frequency and results of observations; Provide a record keeping system that identifies the location of each horse on site and other information such as horses' overall condition, death, etc; Record the death of any animal including each animal's identification number and physical description, or, if unreadable brand, a good physical description with location of death; Dispose of the remains of dead horses.  The contractor may be required, after consultation with the COR, to euthanize horses that are suffering or are in pain.  Specific Services - Handling and Gathering: Horses will normally arrive at the site in trailer loads of approximately 40 head per load.  The contractor will provide a telephone number where they can be reached 24 hours per day for scheduling shipments.  BLM will attempt to schedule shipments for daytime arrival.  However, horses shall be unloaded immediately, regardless of arrival time.  The contractor will unload, sort by age, and condition, if determined to be appropriate by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and/or the Project Inspector (PI), into various groups; All horses shall be handled, treated, and maintained in a humane manner.  Horses in corrals and chutes shall be worked in a manner that minimizes excitement of the horses to prevent injuries from crowding or trampling; Roundup or movement of horses from pastures shall be done with the concurrence of the COR and/or the PI, except in emergency conditions when the contractor determines an immediate gather or movement is necessary for the safety and welfare of the horses.  The contractor shall notify the COR and/or the PI within 24 hours after such movement.  Handling of the horses will be kept to a minimum.  However, it may be necessary to move the horses from one pasture to another because of range management practices; Gathering for the purpose of removing younger or sale animals will be conducted not more than 12 times per year.  The gather time will be determined by the COR and/or PI.  A BLM designated representative will be on site during the gather.  The gather will be conducted in a humane manner.  Adoptable or sale horses will be maintained separate in a corral area for a minimum of 30 days, until notified by the COR and/or PI for shipment.  The Contractor will provide sufficient labor and facility to move and sort adoptable or sale horses during holding prior to shipment; The contractor will be notified by the COR and/or PI one week prior to gathering of the animals.  The COR and/or PI will notify the contractor of the number of animals that need to be gathered, prepared and shipped for adoption. Corral Facility: Corrals may be permanent or temporary (portable panels).  The corrals will be used to receive, hold, gather and prepare horses.  The corrals must be at least 72 inches high and made of stoutly constructed material i.e. pipe, steel, lumber, etc.  Barbed wire will not be allowed in the construction of corrals.

<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for one or more pasture facilities to maintain from 500 to 2,500 wild horses each for one year, with 4 additional one year option periods. The facilities must be located west of the Mississippi River. The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for each Wild Horse & Burro Holding Facility: Wild horses on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Wild and Free Roaming Horses and Burro Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331 1340).  As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt A Horse Program.  Horses that have not been adopted because of age or other factors are being cared for on private land. The purpose of this solicitation is to obtain one or more facilities located in the continental United States, each to pasture 500 to 2,500 wild horses. The intent is to provide a pasture setting for these animals while they are cared for on private land.  During the first years of this contract the majority of the horses may be younger, adoptable animals that will be shipped and received on a year-round basis.  It is the intent of the BLM that the number of animals at the facility will decline during the period of this contract. On  December 8, 2004 Public Law 108-341; Section 142 amended the 1971 Wild and Free-roaming Horses and Burros Act ( Public Law 92-195) that requires the BLM to sell excess wild horses and burros which meet the following criteria: Animals that are 11 years of age and older; or Animals that have been offered unsuccessfully at three adoptions. This may require the BLM to remove animals that meet the above criteria from the contracted facility during the course of the contract.  All animals that are in too poor of health to be prepared or transported will be released back to the pastures or humanely destroyed to avoid undo suffering.  All wild horses that do not meet the above criteria will remain in a free-roaming environment.  Based on this Request for Proposal (RFP) the Bureau of Land Management anticipates the award of one or more contracts, each contract having the capacity to maintain 500 to 2,500 wild horses for long term wild horse holding facilities located in the continental United States.  Each contract shall be for one (1) base year, plus four (4) option years. The facilities must be prepared for the conduct of an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an inspection for specification compliance, to be performed by the BLM upon contract award.  Once a facility meets the minimum requirements of the EA and the specifications contained herein, BLM will begin shipping animals to the facility.  This is anticipated to occur within 90 calendar days from the date of award.  No payments shall be made until after animals are received at the facilities and have resided at the facility for a full one month period.  Contractor will be reimbursed on a per animal feed day basis for the previous month of service.  No advance payments are authorized. Award of a contract(s) constitutes the first and only delivery order of the contract.  Subsequently, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will schedule the delivery and pickup of animals with the Contractor. Objective - The objectives of this contract are: To maintain the excess wild horses in pastures large enough to allow free roaming behavior and that can provide the food, water and shelter necessary to sustain the animals in good condition; To gather and prepare all horses in a humane manner that falls under the criterion of saleable or adoptable animals. 	To minimize the handling of wild horses by humans and sorting of the animals through chutes, gates and corrals; To provide regular, on the ground monitoring of the wild horses to ascertain their well-being and safety; Provide management by individuals who are knowledgeable and experienced about the behavior and nutritional requirements of equines and the management of land for the sustained production of grass and other desirable forage plants. General Services - The contractor shall provide all necessary land, facilities, personnel and supplies to perform the following general tasks. Provide land, forage, shelter, salt, minerals, water and fences necessary to properly care for and maintain 500 to 2,500 (Based on the offeror's proposal) wild horses grazing in pastures.  The pastures shall be capable of producing sufficient standing forage (12 animal unit months of forage per animal) to provide for most of the nutritional requirements of the animals on a yearlong basis.  The contractor must also provide supplemental feed as necessary to maintain the horses in good condition (i.e. during periods of drought, deep snow, ice storms, fire, during times when the forage is depleted of protein content or when other circumstances warrant).  Supplemental feeding is not intended to provide the entire forage intake for extended periods while in pastures and shall not be included in carrying capacity determinations; Provide corrals and adequate facilities to load and unload wild horses on an as needed basis; Unload, sort and segregate animals upon their arrival, in the event that additional horses are transported to the facility; Gather and move horses from pasture to pasture as needed, supervise their health and welfare, provide supplementary feed as needed and maintain the facilities in a safe condition; Gather and hold in isolation horses that fall under the criterion of adoptable or saleable wild horses for a minimum of 30 days, until time for shipment; Provide weekly monitoring of the animals to assess their health and determine death loss.  Prior to submission of the monthly invoice the contractor will conduct a complete inventory of all wild horses.  The results of the each inventory will be included in the monthly invoice.  Maintain a record keeping system that documents the frequency and results of these observations; Provide a record keeping system that identifies the location of each horse on site and other information, such as its overall condition, death, etc.  Each death will be recorded by the freeze mark and/or description of the animal, date the animal was noted as dead and then submitted on each months invoice.  The records shall be made available for duplication within 5 days after a request is made by the COR and/or PI; Dispose of the remains of dead horses.  The contractor may be required to euthanize horses that are suffering or are in pain, as an act of mercy. Specific Services - 	Handling and Gathering: In the event that animals are transported to the facility, they will normally arrive at the site in trailer loads of approximately 35-40 head per load.  The contractor will provide a telephone number where they can be reached 24 hours per day for scheduling shipments.  BLM will attempt to schedule shipments for daytime arrival.  However, horses shall be unloaded immediately, regardless of arrival time.

Horses in corrals and chutes shall be worked in a manner that minimizes excitement of the horses to prevent injuries from crowding or trampling; Gathering or movement of horses from pastures shall be done with the concurrence of the COR and/or PI, except in emergency conditions, when the contractor determines an immediate gather or movement is necessary for the safety and welfare of the horses.  The contractor shall notify the COR and/or PI within 24 hours after such movement.  Handling of the horses will be kept to a minimum. However, it may be necessary to move the horses from one pasture to another because of range management practices; Gathering for the purpose of removing animals will be conducted when it is deemed necessary by the COR/PI.  The gather time will be determined by the COR and/or PI.  A BLM designated representative will be on site during the gather.  The gather will be conducted in a humane manner.  Horses will be maintained in a corral area or small holding pasture for a minimum of 30 days, until notified by the COR and/or PI for shipment.  Contractor will provide sufficient labor and facilities to move and sort horses during holding prior to shipment; The contractor will be notified by the COR and/or PI one week prior to gathering of the animals.  The COR and/or PI will notify the contractor of the number of animals that need to be gathered, prepared and shipped.

Slopes within the pens shall provide for adequate drainage; At least two or more small pastures to maintain approximately 150 wild horses prior to shipment (30 days or more) will be necessary.  These pastures need to be accessible to the working corral, and constructed to have fencing to hold foals if needed during the weaning process.  Fencing must be constructed of small wire mesh, low to the ground to prevent a foal from going under the fencing; The small pastures must have sufficient water for 150 wild horses at a rate of 16 gallons per animal, per day; Adequate chutes and crowding alleys to facilitate gathering, preparing, and shipping animals; The runway must have solid sides, have at least three sliding gates, be solidly constructed of steel or lumber, be at least 36 feet in length, 28-32 inches wide, and at least 72 inches tall; Unloading and Working Facility - The facility shall have a loading and unloading chute, sufficient to safely unload and load semi trailer trucks and small stock trailers.  Chutes shall have solid sides which restrict the animal's vision and will minimize the risk that animals may attempt to jump out of the chute.  Width of the chute must be at least 32 inches. Fences shall be at a minimum of 72 inches high, stoutly constructed and made of lumber, pipe, or steel; Perimeter fences shall be a minimum of 52 inches in height and completely enclose the facility.  Pasture division fences shall be a minimum of 48 inches in height.  All pasture fences shall consist of four strands of barbed wire or other acceptable fencing materials.  If determined by the COR and/or PI, it may be necessary for the contractor to flag certain fences with eight (8) inches of flagging attached to the top horizontal member of the fence every 20 feet to make the fences more visible to the horses. Gates, rather than cattle guards, shall be used at all fence openings to keep horses in pastures; Pastures: The facility shall have sufficient land and forage to sustain 500 to 2,500 (depending on the offeror's proposal) wild horses year round. The land must be privately owned by the offeror or the offeror must have long term control of the offered lands.  Offered lands cannot include public lands, BLM wild horse and burro herd areas, herd management areas or Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territory.  If any public lands, are within the privately owned or controlled land, the public lands must be fenced out and will not be used in the calculation of the stocking rate.  The private lands must be at least 10 miles from any BLM Wild Horse and Burro Herd Management Area, Herd Area and/or Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territory.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to verify that offered lands meet this requirement. Information on the location of BLM Wild Horse and Burro Herd Management Areas, Herd Areas and/or Forest Service Wild Horse and Burro Territory can be obtained by the Forest Service office or, for BLM land, by the BLM local office or the Wild Horse and Burro web site (www.wildhorseandburro.blm.gov.)  Pastures shall be of sufficient size to allow horses freedom of movement and exercise necessary for good health and to continue their free roaming behavior.

The maximum allowable driving distance between all units combined shall be no greater than fifty (50) miles; Sufficient land and forage shall be made available for the number of horses maintained.  However, as the herd is reduced by mortality or removal, pastures may be converted to domestic livestock use by the contractor, provided the use does not interfere with the wild horses.  Stocking domestic horses adjacent to or with the wild horses is unacceptable; The available standing vegetation in pastures must be of sufficient nutritive quality and quantity to maintain the horses in good condition yearlong, with supplemental feeding as described in paragraph f, below.  Good condition is described as follows: ribs cannot be visually distinguished, but can be easily felt; backbone is not visible; hip bones do not show; withers are distinguishable but do not protrude; shoulders and neck blend smoothly into the body; The stocking rate for the site shall be adjusted as necessary to assure horses are maintained in good condition, as described above; Shelter from the natural elements shall be provided in each pasture by the topography (e.g., canyons, hills, etc.), other natural features such as trees, or manmade structures; Vegetation monitoring will be done by qualified personnel.  If vegetation utilization exceeds the moderate level, changes may need to be made so land health standards are maintained.  Supplemental Feed - Supplemental feed (primarily hay) shall be available at the site to feed the horses when natural forage nutritional value is low.  Supplemental feed shall be of such quality and fed in sufficient quantity to sustain the horses in good condition.  Supplemental feed shall not be fed to individual horses in declining health because of age and other natural causes.  Hay used as supplemental feed shall have a protein content of no less than 12%, be leafy, green, well cured, properly stored and free of dust, and mold.  Feed will be required daily for animals maintained in the corral areas, and supplemental feed will be required for pastured animals only during times when natural forage will not maintain the animals in good condition.  For example this could be during the winter months when the forage nutritional value is low.  Horses maintained in corrals shall be fed hay in sufficient quantity to sustain the horses in good condition.

<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>BLM Request for Proposals, NAR080055, FEEDING OF WILD HORSES AT THE BLM PALOMINO VALLEY WILD HORSE & BURRO CENTER IN NEVADA FOR A 12-MONTH PERIOD, WITH FOUR 12-MONTH OPTIONS. Solicitation number NAR080055 applies and is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the following requirement: The Bureau of Land Management's Palomino Valley Wild Horse & Burro Center has a requirement for feeding services 365 days per year, including holidays, from May 1, 2008 to April 30, 2009, with an option for up to 4 more 12-month periods. The Palomino Valley Wild Horse & Burro Center is located 20 miles north of Sparks, Nevada on State Route 445. The Palomino Valley Wild Horse and Burro Center receives horses and burros directly from the range after they have been gathered. The horses and burros are delivered by single deck trailers with up to 40 horses in one trailer. The horses and burros can be delivered from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm seven days a week. The Contractor will arrive between 7 AM and 8 AM daily and continue to feed for up to 7 hours per day during peak times. During the gathering season the facility will normally receive 400 to 500 animals per month, however, occasionally up to 1,000 head will arrive. The gathering season is approximately from July 1 through February 28. Therefore, the slowest times in terms of care and feeding of captured animals are from April through June. BLM does not gather horses during the foaling season (March 1 through June 30). Although the BLM does not gather horses during this time, the facility will still have horses and burros being prepared for disposition. The number of animals in the facility coincides with the gathering season. For the months of August through March, the facility averages between 1,200 and 1,500 head per day. The remaining months the facility averages between 200 and 500 head per day. The Contractor shall provide sufficient personnel to assure the daily feeding of up to 2,500 animals during the peak times (August through March) and as few as 50 animals during the slack times (April through June). The total facility is capable of holding up to 2,500 animals at one time. The facility consists of 10 outside pens and 36 smaller inside pens. The outside pens are used to maintain the majority of the animals and can hold an average of 200 animals per pen. These pens have large movable hay mangers. The inside pens are used to segregate horses that have just been unloaded from gathers, for loads being shipped out, sick and/or injured animals as well as horses with special needs (i.e. to separate studs, mares, mares with foals and young horses). These smaller pens have permanent hay mangers. It is anticipated that the feeding services for the wild horses and burros will require at least two contract personnel on a daily basis.  Since this facility does not have an automated feeding system, one of the Contractor's employees shall drive the BLM furnished truck and tractor, and the other Contractor employee shall break up the square bales of hay and place them by hand into the hay mangers. A site visit has been scheduled for January 30, 2008 at 10:00 A.M. Attendees will meet with John Neill (775) 475-2222 at the BLM Palomino Valley Wild Horse Center, 15780 SR 445, Reno, NV 89510. This is a 100% set-aside for small business. The standard NAICS classification is 115210. Size standard is $6.5 million. Solicitation NAR080055 will be available on or about January 16, 2008.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Facsimile proposals shall be sent to (303) 236-9421. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered eligible for award.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institute Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Office of Acquisitions, The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Branch, intends to negotiate a sole source, 6-month contract extension in order to avoid a lapse in contract performance and continue operations of the Biological Testing Facility (BTF). The extension is required because of delays in the planned competitive follow-on acquisition. The planned extension will permit the BTF to continue to function while a competitive acquisition for these services is conducted.  The current requirement for a BTF is fulfilled through a contract with Bioqual Incorporated, under contract N01-HD-23338. The BTF performs a wide range of screens, assays, safety tests and analytical procedures for the evaluation of new drugs, formulations and delivery systems relevant to endocrine and anti-fertility activity of compounds that are provided by the Government and management of data obtained in support of the contraceptive and reproductive health development program of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).   AUTHORITY:  41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii) and HHSRA 306.302-1(a) (2) (ii) A and B.   Planned clinical trials are dependent on the outcomes of tests performed at this facility.   If the testing facility is not available for testing new compounds planned clinical trials will be delayed.   As a result, substantial duplication of costs to the Government which are not expected to be recovered through competition would occur.   In addition, postponement of clinical trials will result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements.  However, if there are sources who feel they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting information required in Numbered Note 22 within 45 days of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Overnight deliveries should be mailed to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7AO7, Bethesda, Maryland 20852.  No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Weather Service (NWS), Climate Predication Center, (CPC) intends to negotiate on sole source basis, under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302 Other Than Full and Open Competition, with the Environmental Systems Research International Institute, Inc. 380 New York Street, Redlands, CA  92373-8100, to provide proprietary software maintenance for ESRI ArcGIS, ArcINFO, and ArcView.  The Government anticipates a firm fixed-price contract for a twelve (12) month period from date of award and two (2) twelve (12) month option periods.  ArcGIS is a product suite consisting of desktop and server products ranging from ArcView to ArcINFO for desktop products and ArcIMS and ArcGIS server for server based products.  The (CPC) currently uses ArcGIS desktop and server products.   CPC has 13 licenses for  ArcVIEW, 3 Licenses for ArcINFO and one server license for ArcGIS Server and ArcIMS.  ESRI?s ArcGIS product suite also includes extensions or additions to the base product.  The (CPC) is using ArcView and ArcINFO for interactive (manual) product generations along with extensions.  The ArcGIS product suite is the premier Geographic Information System product, and is used extensively and to a great extent exclusively by the USGS, USDA and NOS (part of NOAA).  Currently we share both information and products with the USGS, USDA, USAF, and FEWS (Part of the U.S. Department of State).    We have extremely close relationship with the USDA and even maintain an office (JAWF) staffed with 3 NWS employees located in the USDA facility in Washington, D.C.  Both the USGS and USDA will be supplying code in AML (ArcINFO Macro Language) which is unique to ArcINFO and ArcObjects which is common to both ArvView and ArcINFO.  This transfer of code has and will continue to result in significant savings in time and will minimize the effort it will take to produce the required products.  CPC is currently transitioning to a server based GIS system which will increase the productivity of the ArcGIS desktop products and allow our users and forecasters access to GIS products using a web browser such as Microsoft Explorer or Firefox.

ArcINFO is the highest tier of the ArcGIS product suite and allows automation and input of multiple types of data whereas ArcView allows for most editing and processing of our data where Visual Basic or phython can be used.  The USGS and USDA have developed a complete set of programs to automate most of their products including many products that we share development on.  This request is to continue the maintenance, update services, and telephone (or mail support) that CPC is relying on for support for our products.  Continuation of support will allow CPC to meet the needs of our partners and stay compatible with the scripts and methods that our partners share with us.  Current software is needed to allow CPC to fulfill or commitment for participation in the production of the North America Drought product along with additional products supplied to the USDA, US Department of State (the FEWS program), and the US Air Force all of which need to be supplied in a GIS format.

Currently ArcGIS (ArcINFO, ArcView, ArcGIS servers and there associated extension) is the ONLY suite of products that can fulfill all of our needs.  ArcGIS is both patented and copyrighted by ESRI and ESRI is the only supplier for ArcGIS.

Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government?s requirement are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates a proven satisfactory ability to provide these services to permit agency analysis.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. This acquisition will be issued in accordance with FAR PART 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Affirmative written responses must be received not later than 25 January 2008.  Please submit any and all written responses to Mark.A.Miller@noaa.gov or Grace.E.Carter-Tyer@noaa.gov.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) FSIS-03-B-08 for biological screen tests for the detection of antimicrobial residues in animal tissues.  This in-plant test was developed by FSIS and is called the Fast Antimicrobial Screen Test (FAST).  FAST is capable of detecting beta lactams (both penicillins and cephalosporins), aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and sulfas.  In these tests, cotton swabs saturated with tissue fluid from a suspected carcass are placed on a culture plate whose surface has been seeded with spores of a harmless organism (Bacillus megaterium spores for the FAST test).  The Government estimates 125,000 FAST tests are used annually.  The contractor will be responsible for quantitative analysis that may exceed 3,000 samples per year for a given project.  Offerors must provide the facilities, personnel, and the capacity to handle the volume of samples required by this effort.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325413, In-Vitro Diagnostic Substance Manufacturing, and the small business size standard is 500 employees.  This procurement will be conducted as a Noncommercial Item acquisition under FAR Part 15.  Offerors will be required to submit a technical and price proposal for evaluation by the Government.  The period of performance will be for a 12 month base period plus four (4) additional 12 month option periods.  Award will be made to the offeror who submits the proposal considered most advantageous to the Government considering price and technical evaluation factors.  The offers must conform to the RFP instructions and be received by the closing date specified in the RFP.  The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or about January 25, 2008, with an anticipated offer due date on or about February 25, 2008.

<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is planning to add additional locations and Centers to the National Children's Study (NCS).  The Government anticipates multiple contract awards to organizations or institutions for the requirement described below in this announcement.  More details will appear in the Request for Proposals (RFP) to be issued in approximately 2 to 4 weeks after the date of the publication of this announcement.  This announcement is intended to inform interested offerors of a planned RFP, of important background information, and of some key requirements essential for responding to the RFP.

Background information on the Study is available on the NCS web site www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov.  The Study is a large, long-term longitudinal study of environmental influences on children's health and development.  This Study will explore a broad range of environmental factors that could influence the health and development of children.  For this Study, environment is broadly defined to include biological, chemical, physical, social and behavioral influences on children.  The broad range of outcomes includes obesity, diabetes and physical development; injuries; asthma; pregnancy-related outcomes; and mental health issues.  The Study's goal is to better understand how various exposures and genetic factors affect or are associated with children?s health, disease and development.  The Study will include a sample of approximately 100,000 children born in the U.S. beginning with early pregnancy or before and following the children for a wide range of health and developmental outcomes and environmental exposures until at least 21 years of age.  More detail about the design and methods for the NCS can be found in the Research Plan on the NCS web site www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov. 

Information will be collected from participants in the Study who reside in one of the 105 locations selected as primary sampling units for the first stage of a multi-stage sampling process.  The Study locations are identified on the map and list of Study Locations at http://www.nationalchildrensstudy.gov/about/locations/.  The information will be collected by Study Centers that perform the data collection activities in the Study locations.  It is important to distinguish the Study Centers (organizations or institutions engaged in conducting the study) from the Locations (geographic areas, counties) where eligible participants reside. 

In the initial phase of this Study, which was awarded in September of 2005, data will be collected in seven geographic areas in the United States to pilot the full NCS study methods.  Data collection in each of these seven geographic locations is being conducted by a single Study Center, referred to as Vanguard Locations and Centers respectively.  The Vanguard Centers will begin enrollment of Study participants and data collection as a pilot approximately one year prior to initiation of enrollment in the non-pilot full protocol.  

Subsequent to the first Vanguard pilot year, the Study anticipates accruing study locations in three waves or stages separated by one to two years subject to availability of funds.  Contracts for additional Study Centers to conduct data collections in a subset of the Locations were awarded in 2007. The current procurement is for the award of additional contracts to conduct data collections in as many of the 58 additional Locations.  These Locations are listed at the end of this announcement.  Additional information about the timing of implementation for these Locations will be provided in the RFP.  The Government anticipates future solicitations to cover data collections in Locations for which there is no successful proposal in response to this solicitation. 

To serve as Study Centers for the Study, interested offerors must demonstrate the ability to conduct the Study in one or more of the 58 Study Locations listed at the end of this announcement.  The following background information and some key requirements are provided to alert interested offerors to certain aspects of the anticipated solicitation:

These proposed solutions will be presented to IRS and will be evaluated as part of the standard IRS change management process.)

Standardize technology and approach to managing it.  (Single source of technology support for the components covered by the PWS will lead to a more streamlined implementation and support.)

Common change management process.  (The process for system and configuration changes will adhere to the overall IRS change and configuration management process.)

Incorporate security as an integral process.  The contract will incorporate IRS security requirements into the overall technology planning, implementation and support processes. The Contractor will be required to interface with the applicable internal and external security organizations and ensure that all vulnerabilities are addressed in a timely manner.
_

As stated in the RFP and PWS, the IRS will retain the authority for making all operational and strategic technology decisions.  The Contractor shall be required to use the existing IRS change management and approval processes.  The individual and shared responsibilities of the Contractor and the IRS are as follows:

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The CECOM Life Cycle Management Command Acquisition Center intends to award a new work modification to contract W15P7T-02-C-L421 on a non-competitive basis in support of the Multi-Mission Radar (MMR). The anticipated award will be made under the Auth ority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, to Syracuse Research Corporation (SRC), North Syracuse, NY. The Multi-Mission Radar Advanced Technology Objective (MMR-ATO) is a unique radar system where only one system exists wi thin the Department of Defense.   The prime contractor, SRC, has designed, fabricated, tested and demonstrated the system from its inception. Only SRC, the source that is developing the MMR, can accomplish the required upgrades without substantial duplicat ion of costs and delivery delays. Any other source would need to reverse engineer the MMR to understand its design, followed by production and testing efforts before it could commence implementation of the required upgrades. The additional effort is expect ed to have a period of performance of approximately 9 months. A tracking number W15P7T-08-R-P417 has been assigned to this effort and should be reference along with contract number W15P7T-02-C-L421. TECHNICAL questions should be addressed to Mr. Steven Wag ner; email steven.wagner@us.army.mil, (732) 532-4095. CONTRACTUAL questions should be addressed to Mr. Andrew Dellomo, Contracting Officer, email; Andrew.dellomo@us.army.mil; 732-532-3569 or Ms. Meghan Mele, Contract Specialist, email; Meghan.mele@us.army. mil, 732-532-8299.

<DESC>The Contracting Center of Excellence (CCE) on behalf of the Department of Army, Office of the Chief Public Affairs, intends to award a sole source contract to L-3 Communications/MPRI , for procurement of Strategic Communication Support Services, as a  bridge contract for 60 days with a further 60 days (two-60 day option periods). Period of performance will start on 01 Feb 2008.  The Army must clearly communicate complex messages to many diverse audiences on a wide range of topics. Effectively communica ting about sustaining, preparing, resetting and transforming the Army during an era of persistent conflict is absolutely essential to obtaining the resources required to support Soldiers and Families.  This bridge contract is essential to maintaining the c ontinuity and quality of critical ongoing projects.  Any change in contractor at this point will result in loss of productivity and unacceptable quality of the finished products currently under revision and publication.  Duplication of efforts and time to bring a new contractor up to speed will result in missed milestones for delivery of key products to the Army and Congress.  An example is the Army Posture Statement, which must be delivered in early February for Congressional budget testimony by the Secret ary of the Army and Chief of Staff.   The current contractor is fully engaged in meeting current short-term critical project milestones, and awarding this bridge contract to another contractor will jeopardize completion of those projects and create the ris k of mission failure.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all capability statements received by 15 Jan 2008, 9:00 am.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract upon review of the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. See note 22.  The Point of Contact for this notice is Darlene Ferrare, ferrada@hqda.army.mil.<BR>

Add this information to the first paragraph under Description:

8) Asset Management Assistance
Federal Lands Highway (FLH) Asset Management is a systematic process to optimize the preservation, maintenance, monitoring and timely replacement of highway assets and their operation through cost-effective management, programming, and resource allocation decisions.  It integrates data management, engineering principles, and economic theory and provides tools to monitor performance of our FLMA transportation infrastructure.  FLH Asset Management provides a framework for short- and long-range planning of transportation infrastructure improvements for federal lands.  Successful asset management system implementation is dependent upon integration of the four transportation management systems: Pavement, Bridge, Safety, and Congestion Management systems (PMS, BMS, SMS, CMS) in the FLMA?s transportation planning and management practices.  The four transportation management systems are designed to provide the tools to guide the FLMA?s in developing Long Range Transportation Plans and Transportation Improvement Programs funded under the FLH Program.    
The Asset Management work will be to provide any and all services related to the implementation of Asset Management Strategic Plans for FLH or the FLMA?s within the 50 United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia. 
Examples of the work required but are not limited to the following: resource paper preparation containing comprehensive assessment of FLH and FLMA Asset Management needs, resource paper preparation documenting all existing FLH and FLMA?s data sources for FLH-wide and FLMA data exchange; business rules and procedures for data management, asset management Gap Analysis Report preparation documenting available data and data needs and management system tools that are required but missing, develop and conduct pilot projects and reports and presentations demonstrating asset management benefits to FLMAs, develop Asset Management Strategic Implementation Plans for each FLMA, support NPS in implementation of management systems for pavement, bridge, safety, and congestion for all regions, educate/ partner with NPS coordinators to identify opportunities for future implementation of management systems, strengthen FHWA/NPS partnerships through continued training and support, promote the need to fill critical data gaps, assist in evaluating short-term and long-term data collection needs, resources, and benefits, develop Strategic Implementation Plans to implement asset management systems into FLMA transportation planning and management practices on a nationwide basis, provide technical support for the FY 09 Highway Trust Fund Reauthorization, and educate/ partner with USDA FS to identify opportunities for future implementation of management systems.

2.   The time for receipt of proposals is extended until 2:00 PM EST January 25, 2008.
________________________________________________________________


The Federal Acquisition Service of the General Services Administration (GSA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement a Local Services Acquisition (LSA) for Telecommunications Services.  The Government will award a series of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, with a base period of three years and four (4) twelve month option periods.  Firm Fixed Price task orders will be issued under the resultant IDIQ contract.  The Government plans to award multiple LSA contracts in the states of Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware.  These contracts will be for the use of all Federal agencies, authorized Federal contractors, agency-sponsored universities and laboratories and, as authorized by law or regulation, state, local, and tribal Governments, and other organizations.  The Government has defined three service groups: Voice Services (VS), Data Transmission Services (DTS) and Internet Access Services (IAS), along with the labor and material necessary to connect these services to customer premises equipment (CPE).  Offerors must propose mandatory voice services to be eligible for an award.

The Government desires to make multiple awards for LSA services but reserves the right to limit the number of awards.  Contracts will be awarded to Offerors whose proposals are most advantageous to the Government.  The actual number of contracts awarded will be determined by the Government and based on technical acceptability and price evaluation of mandatory LSA services.  The following Technical factors will be considered: Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Management Approach.  The Technical Factors of Technical Approach and Past Performance will be approximately equal in weight and each will be greater in weight than the Management Approach factor.  The combined weight of all technical evaluation factors will be approximately equal to the Price Factor of Total Evaluated Discounted Cost.  Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used as set forth in FAR Part 15.  Offerors are advised that an award may be made without discussion or any contact concerning the proposals received.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; and to award contracts to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total evaluated discounted cost.  Therefore, proposals should be initially submitted on the most favorable terms.

The Request for Proposal (RFP), consisting of the solicitation and all attachments will be issued and posted electronically on the www.fedbizoppps.gov website.  Any questions regarding this synopsis should be directed to Kristin L. Markiewicz, GSA Contract Specialist, at Kristin.Markiewicz@gsa.gov.  This procurement is being conducted under full and open competition on an unrestricted basis under NAICS Code 517110.  The solicitation should be available on or about 07/23/2007.  Potential offerors should be advised that the date of a pre-proposal conference will be announced at the same time as the issuance of the RFP and is estimated to be conducted approximately two weeks after the official RFP is posted.

<DESC>This modification accomplishes the following actions:

Provides a draft Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause for comment (separate attachment).  

Replies to the following questions received to date:

1. Is there an incumbent contractor?   Reply:  No.

2. Is this procurement planned to be a single contract with one company or will multiple contracts be awarded?     Reply:  Whether or not the government will make a single or multiple award will be determined, in part, based upon the responses received to the sources sought synopsis among other considerations.

3. Capability Statement Response: Please distinguish between information sought from offerors under 1a (organization's experience relative to the scope of work) and 1b (breadth and scope of technical expertise and experience relative to the scope of work). Both seem to relate to an offeror's relevant contract and project experience. Is 1a aimed at the contract level and 1b more at the project level?    Reply:  Response to 1a should explain actual experiences related to the draft SOW, while responses to 1b should  focus on detailed descriptions of available technical expertise relative to the specific 12 primary tasks.

4. Would an 11 inch by 18 inch fold out be counted as one or two pages?    Reply: Fold outs will be counted as 2 pages.  Additionally, doubled-sided pages will be counted as 2 pages.

<SOLNBR>FA8726-08-R-0001
<RESPDATE>012408
<ARCHDATE>03012008
<CONTACT>Gerri Peloquin, Contracting Officer, gerri.peloquin@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>Title: GLOBAL BROADCAST SERVICE (GBS) SBM DECC Transition SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS) Contracting Officer: Ms. Gerri L. Peloquin, (781-271-2313)  Program POC: Capt. Ray Breault, GBS JPO Satellite Broadcast PM (781-271-6335) 1. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS).  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  Any information submitted by respondents to this SSS is strictly voluntary.  This SSS does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to the SSS request.  Please note that a Request for Information (RFI) was previously released 29 Aug 2007 and followed up by an RFI Industry Day 20 Sep 2007.  The RFI Industry Day presentation material remains posted on HERBB/FEDBizOPPS.   2. Joint tactical operations require high speed, high volume multimedia communications and information flow for deploying, deployed and garrisoned forces.  The GBS system employs emerging technologies that allow the war-fighter to satisfy these information requirements in the conduct of modern warfare.  An extension of the Global Information Grid (GIG), GBS provides worldwide, space-based, IP over DVB-S/S2, broadcast of high speed, one-way transmission of video, imagery and other information to support forces in garrison, in transit and in theater. GBS provides relief to overburdened communications systems already in place and provides information to previously unsupportable users. The GBS must be continuously accessible to end users and must therefore employ readily available commercial technologies which are inexpensive and easily integrated into existing systems and processes,  yet not so unwieldy as to be unusable by smaller and more mobile units.  3. The GBS Joint Program Office (JPO), 653rd Electronics Systems Group (653 ELSG/KCK) located at Hanscom AFB, MA, intends to issue an RFP for a contract to transition GBS Satellite Broadcast Management (SBM) functionality, currently hosted at Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station (NCTAMS) facilities, to DISA Defense Enterprise Computing Center (DECC) facilities and subsequently implement selected GBS Operational Requirements Document (ORD) Block III Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) capabilities into the DECC-based system.   4.  The GBS JPO currently has funded FY08-FY12 requirements for the US Air Force to transition GBS SBM functionality into DECC facilities. These capabilities will be incorporated into the GBS DECC-based system for the US Army, US Navy, US Marine Corps, US Air Force, and Other Government Agencies (OGA). GBS ORD III, JROC-validated and approved on 12 Jan 2005, the GBS ORD-III Requirements Clarification, issued by HQ AFSPC on 23 Aug 2007, and the GBS SBM DECC Transition draft System Requirements Document (SRD) dated 19 Dec 2007 are posted on  HERBB/FEDBizOPPS website. 5.  Statement of Objectives (SOO) [Abbreviated SOO Narrative]:  a. Transfer SBM functions to DECCs with new hardware and software architecture by FY2010. b. Maximize use of unmodified COTS software, to minimize sustainment/maintainability costs and facilitate a technology refresh of the system. c. Provide a transparent transition of SBM functions to two DECC sites, one as a primary transmit site and one as a backup transmit site, by FY 2010 without interruption to the operational broadcast (and complete the full transition of all the current GBS data sources and users).   d. Achieve full compliance with DoD requirements for TRANSEC of satellite links by leveraging the JIPMs at the DoD Teleports, and when available for purchase by the Services, for RS upgrade and maintain full ATO IAW the most recent and evolving DoD IA policies and directives. e. In coordination with DECC personnel, design and implement solutions for integration into the DECCs, and operate within the business model of the DECCs. f. In coordination with the Services, design and implement retrofit kit solutions for associated GBS RS transition to the DECC-based system (e.g., RS RBM software technology refresh, JIPM hardware, etc.). g.  Implement selected follow-on GBS ORD Block III P3I Capabilities into the GBS DECC-based system (without any redesign/redevelopment of the new DECC-based architecture baseline).  Anticipated follow-on efforts could include (but not limited to):  1. Development for Transmit Receive Suite (TRS). 2. Development for Enhanced Source Integration. 3. Integration of Ground Mobile Receive Suites (GMRS). 4. Integration of Broadcast Receive Suites - Terrestrial (BRST). 5. Development for Enhanced GIG Network-Ops Integration. 6. Software Development for Broadcast Efficiency Metric Reporting. 6.  Interested firms are invited to submit a statement of capability clearly addressing their ability to satisfy the outlined requirements serving as the prime contractor.  This statement of capability should include related experience, qualifications and capabilities together with a statement of intent to submit proposals as a Prime.  Any proprietary information should be identified as such.  Please limit replies to 10 pages (including cover page), 8.5 x 11 inch, one-sided, with 1 inch margins and font no smaller than 10 point.  If more than 10 pages are submitted, only the first 10 pages will be reviewed.  Please include the following contact information (company name, address, contact name, telephone number, email address, and Assigned Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) on the cover page.  Small businesses and disadvantaged sources should identify themselves as such.  This  planned contract will be subject to applicable FAR 9.505 provisions concerning Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI) and interested firms will be required to propose acceptable mitigation plans, prior to award, should any OCI conditions exist.   7.

Statement of Work: STATEMENT OF WORK VASCULAR DIALYSIS ACCESS PROCEDURES VA NEW YORK HARBOR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM NEW YORK CAMPUS OR BROOKLYN CAMPUS 1.  Introduction and Scope of Work An arteriovenous (AV) fistula or graft is a conduit between an artery and a vein that may be surgically created to facilitate dialysis.  Due to infection or other factors, a fistula or graft may become occluded, partially or totally, or clotted, compromising dialysis.  Treatment of the fistula or graft by open surgical repair, reconstruction or replacement or insertion of a catheter for temporary access exposes the patient to risks associated with surgery, hospitalization, infection, and other negative impacts.  These may be avoided by means of nonsurgical interventional vascular access procedures to maintain or restore access patency, which can be performed on an outpatient basis.   Capacity to perform these procedures at VA NYHHS is limited.  Due to the need to maintain dialysis schedules and avoid surgery and other complications that arise when dialysis access is lost or occluded, it is sometimes impossible or inadvisable to schedule patients to be treated at VA NYHHS within the time frames required for patient care needs.  In these circumstances, and only after the Director of Hemodialysis or his designee has determined that other options cannot be employed, will the patient be referred for contract service.  A contract is needed to make these services available for dialysis patients when other options cannot be used.  Patients may be referred from either the New York (Manhattan) campus or the Brooklyn campus of VA NYHHS.         The Contractor will perform vascular access procedures to repair failed fistulas or grafts with the goal of restoring patency in dialysis patients referred through Nephrology Section, VA NYHHS.      2.  Requirements The Contractor agrees, in accordance with the terms and conditions stated herein, to furnish VA NYHHS with the services specified and at the prices specified in this contract.  Contractor services include but are not limited to the following procedures and studies, which will be performed on an outpatient basis at the Contractor's facility:   "	Percutaneous thrombectomy (de-clotting) of the fistula or graft by the following methods: o	Puncture of the AV fistula or graft by needle or vascular sheath o	Mechanical and/or pharmacologic methods that dissolve, fragment or remove the obstructing material "	Angioplasty of the fistula or graft either as a primary intervention or secondary to thrombectomy if flow remains inadequate and is caused by lesions other than thrombotic material "	Angiography in association with thrombectomy or angioplasty "	Vascular stenting if angioplasty fails to maintain patency "	Placement of tunneled dialysis catheters  "	Tunneled dialysis catheter exchange "	Diagnostic angiography  - rarely necessary as a confirmatory study as part of a decision to treat, but is appropriate if one or more of the following indications are present: o	Reduced intra-access flow o	Elevated static venous pressures o	Elevated dynamic venous pressures o	Elevated recirculation o	Unexplained decrease in U, Kt/V o	Abnormal physical exam (loss of thrill, pulsatile graft, arm swelling, development of venous collaterals, pseudoaneurysm) o	Prolonged bleeding after needle removal o	Elevated negative arterial pre-pump pressures o	Ischemic changes of the extremity (steal syndrome) o	Inefficient dialysis "	Post-procedure evaluation and follow-up and clinical consultation regarding complications of interventional procedures a.	Procedure for Referral - All patients will be evaluated and referred by a VA physician assigned to Nephrology Section of Medical Service, VA NYHHS.  This evaluation will occur prior to the patient being scheduled for testing or intervention by the Contractor.  Referral information will include relevant access and medical history, findings of physical examination, list of medications and indication(s) for performing vascular access procedures.  Contact to schedule the patient will be made by telephone to the Contractor in an expeditious manner.  Authorization for any additional service, which must be within the scope specified in this contract, will be made by the Director, Hemodialysis.      b.	Timeliness Requirements - Patients referred for urgent interventional studies and/or procedures will be scheduled for testing and/or treatment by the Contractor within one week of referral.  Patients referred for elective procedures will be scheduled within two weeks of referral.  Referrals and services to be performed will occur within normal business hours on weekdays.      c.	Patient Safety - The Contractor shall provide competent, quality medical service to all patients referred under this contract.  Appropriate infection control practices for hand hygiene, standard precautions, protective barriers, transmission-based precautions and intravascular devices conforming to recommendations of the CDC and other appropriate authorities must be maintained.  Patients will be monitored for excessive bleeding and pain and treated appropriately.  Before discharge, they will be hemodynamically stable, having achieved hemostasis, and able to tolerate any pain.  Contractor will have standard equipped crash cart available for cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, and personnel with appropriate ACLS training and certification on site during patient treatment.  Patients in need of additional, urgent or emergency care while undergoing contract services will be treated in the most medically appropriate way by appropriately credentialed and trained personnel either at Contractor's site, the nearest facility with an emergency room or by transfer back to VA NYHHS if the patient is in stable condition and is deemed able to be transported.  Authorization for non-emergent additional service, which must be within the scope specified in this contract, will be made by the Director, Hemodialysis.      d.	Qualifications of Personnel and Contractor Facility- Technicians and physicians assigned by the Contractor to perform the services covered by this contract must have current, full and unrestricted New York State licenses.  Physicians assigned by the Contractor must be board certified radiologists or nephrologists.  Radiologists performing or interpreting vascular interventional procedures and studies must be either fellowship-trained or certified by the American Board of Radiology in this subspecialty.

Licensed independent practitioners providing contracted services must be credentialed and privileged by VA NYHHS before rendering service.  Notice of any substitutions of key personnel must be provided to the Director of Hemodialysis, and the qualifications of the substitutes must be supplied and approved in advance by VA NYHHS's Executive Chief of Staff.  The Contractor's facility must have current accreditation by The Joint Commission and notify the Contracting Officer, COTR and Director of Hemodialysis immediately of any changes in such status.   e.	Reporting and Documentation Requirements - The Contractor shall provide by fax to the referring VA physician immediately after services are rendered a brief report specifying what procedures were performed, diagnostic and operative findings, and the outcome.  The Contractor shall provide a full report of the procedure results within one week  of the performance of the service, in hard copy format by mail marked "Confidential" or by confidential fax to the Director of Hemodialysis.  The information provided will be sufficient for the VA physician to understand the diagnosis and therapeutic result, determine if dialysis is possible through the affected access, and whether surgical follow-up for new access surgery is necessary.  Documentation must include accurate CPT coding and meet all requirements for third party reimbursement..  The documentation supplied by the Contractor will be scanned into the VA's computerized patient record system (CPRS) at the direction of the COTR (Contracting Officer's Technical Representative).       The Contractor shall establish and maintain a log of patients treated under this contract including the patient's full name and full SS#, scheduled and actual dates of evaluation and/or treatment and the studies and/or procedures performed with accurate CPT coding.  This log will be submitted in confidence to the VA COTR on a quarterly basis (for periods January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December), at time of invoicing or at any other time upon request. f.	Reimbursement Method - The services shall be performed as a procedure-based fee for service, under the direction of the Medical Director of the Contractor.   g.	Billing / Payments - Payment will be made on a fee-for-procedure basis, per CPT code.   Only the five highest reimbursement CPT codes will be paid.

Progress and Compliance The Contractor's organization must ensure that all contracted services provided by licensed independent practitioners are within the scope of their privileges.   Joint Commission accreditation must be maintained.  Performance of the Contractor will be monitored by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative(s) who is designated as the Administrative Officer, Medical Service, Brooklyn campus (Clelia Sarrapere).  In addition, provider-specific clinical performance of the Contractor will be monitored as each case is completed by the Director of Hemodialysis by the following methods:   (1)	Review of the medical documentation submitted as required in paragraph 2e. (2)	Input on Contractor performance by staff involved with the referral and patients referred for service; input may include results of patient/staff satisfaction studies.  (3)	Follow up of any patient complaints. The results of provider-specific performance reviews will be reported through the Chief of Medicine to the Professional Standards and Credentialing Board as part of the service's ongoing professional practice evaluation reporting, with results and recommendations for performance improvement reported to the Clinical Executive Board, the Executive Council and the Director.   The Government Contracting Officer shall make the final determination of the validity of any customer complaints.  The Director of Hemodialysis, as well as the Executive Chief of Staff and other facility managers, where necessary, in concert with the Government Contracting Officer, will provide input on steps to improve care, treatment and services in the event that contracted services do not meet expectations.      Penalty for Non-Performance - If any of the services do not conform to contract requirements, the Government may require the Contractor to perform the services again in conformity with contract requirements, at no additional cost to the Government.  Such cases will be discussed between the Director of Hemodialysis and the Contractor to ensure that expectations in the re-performance are clear and appropriate.  When the defects in services cannot be corrected by re-performance, the Government may:  (1)	Require the Contractor to take necessary action to ensure that future performance conforms to contract requirements; and (2)	Reduce the contract price to reflect the reduced value of the services performed.

<DESC>The Human Remains Decontamination System (HRDS) Program Manager is conducting a market survey to determine the availability of a Human Remains Decontamination/Transport System.  This system will provide the capability to ensure the safety of personne l handling and processing chemically, biologically, or radiologically (CBR) contaminated human remains and provide the ability to repatriate those remains in accordance with established DoD policy (Publication JP 4-06, Mortuary Affairs in Joint Operations ).  The HRDS is envisioned to include three sub-systems: a system to provide for the safe transportation of contaminated remains from the point of fatality to a Mortuary Affairs Decontamination Collection Point (MADCP);  a system to provide a means to dec ontaminate the remains and allow Mortuary Affairs (MA) personnel to safely and effectively conduct their mission; and a system to provide for the safe and legal transportation of potentially contaminated remains from the decontamination point to the United  States for disposition.  The HRDS program manager seeks responses for an integrated system that fulfills all three missions.<BR>Parameters for the handling of remains from point of fatality to the MADCP system include: demonstrate liquid and hazardous vap or containment for 48 hours, demonstrate survivability after being decontaminated once externally with standard military decontaminants (e.g. Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion (RSDL), soapy water, or household bleach).  Parameters for the decontaminatio n of Remains include: demonstrate that the system provides a safe and effective work environment for personnel performing the MA Mission, demonstrate the systems ability to provide a means to reduce the CBR hazard to personnel; including efficacy of decon tamination methods; facilitate the MA Mission.  Parameters for the transportation of remains from the MADCAP back to the United States include:  demonstrate liquid and vaporous containment for a minimum of 30 days, demonstrated ability to meet United Natio ns (UN) and International Air Transportation Association (IATA) standards for transportation of hazardous material.<BR>For all sub-systems decontaminants proposed, please provide evidence of compatibility between the decontaminant and other materials in th e system, specifically including personal protective equipment and Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) equipment.<BR>Please provide a white paper (10-page limit) explaining the capabilities of the products and components.  Include supporting documen tation as it applies.  In addition to the parameters above, please address the following:   a detailed description of the proposed system and sub-elements, decontamination procedures which could be used with the system, cost per system, dimensions, includi ng height, width, length, weight (as they apply); the weight capacity and internal dimensions of each container, concepts and methods used to ensure the systems impermeability to liquids and vapors/gases, transportation requirements for the product, power  requirements, results of any pertinent testing; including results for protection/hazard mitigation against hazardous materials, Toxic Industrial Chemicals (TICs), or CBR agents; packaging requirements, production capability, MSDSs if applicable, shipping and storage requirements or restrictions.

<SUBJECT>A -- Method for Producing Nanoparticle Semiconductor Materials
<DESC>The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has discovered a method for the production of nanoparticle semiconductor materials. We have produced nanoparticle sized copper-indium-disulfide semiconductor materials that are used in advanced photovoltaic devices. The source of the semiconductor materials are derived from inexpensive materials. The particles produced are well known nanoparticle semiconductor materials capable of capturing photonic energy and converting it to electron energy. Other nanomaterials may be produce by the process.  Additional novel uses of the process and materials have also been proposed by the inventors.  The primary advantages of the process are:

- The Cost to produce nanoparticles is orders of magnitude less than current processes;
- Little or no waste created from the process;
- The process creates nanoparticles in the range of 3 nm and up;
- The process is tunable to produce the desired nanoparticle size;
- The process creates a narrow range of nanoparticle sizes (+/- 1 nm in size);
- New applications are possible as a result of the new nanoparticle creations;
- The process conditions allow for use of current reactor technology; and
- The process utilizes a continuous process.

The INL is soliciting interest from qualified partners interested in participating in projects and commercializing this technology. It is anticipated that the project will be carried out through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with funding support being provided by the participant(s). The INL is seeking patent protection on the process and rights to practice the intellectual property may be licensed exclusively or non-exclusively. The INL invites interested parties to contact us regarding the details of licensing and commercializing this technology.  A nondisclosure agreement will be necessary to discuss the technology in detail.  Interested parties should respond within two weeks of the first posting of this notice. For questions regarding the technology, licensing, and working with the INL, please contact Jason Stolworthy:

<SUBJECT>B--ESPA Spatial Water Allocation Model
<DESC>This announcement is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available. The Bureau of Reclamation- Pacific Northwest Region, Boise, Idaho, per the authority of FAR 6.001(a) and using FAR Parts 13 procedures, intends to negotiate a non-competitive contract with RD Schmidt and Associates in Isanti, MN 55040 to develop a coupled groundwater/surface water/economic spatial water allocation model for Eastern Snake River Plain Aquifer. Reclamation, the University of Idaho (U of I), and the Idaho Water Resources Research Institute (IWRRI) are collaborating with the Idaho Dept. of Water Resources (IDWR) in a hydrologic and economic modeling study (collaborative study) aimed at developing a special water allocation model for the ESP and evaluating various alternatives for balancing water supply and demand in the ESP.The authority for Reclamation's participation in this project comes from Reclamation Act of June 17,1902. The overall objective of this study is to provide state and federal water managers with new modeling tools which will enable them to evaluate both the hydrologic and economic outcomes of various water management alternatives for the ESP. Reclamation's involvement in this collaborative study will be to provide expertise in the area of groundwater hydrology to fulfill technical needs to accomplish the development and application of the spatial water allocation model. Reclamation will contract with RD Schmidt to provide the necessary groundwater expertise to accomplish this work. RD Schmidt (former Reclamation employee) is a groundwater hydrologist doing research in the area of coupling hydrologic models and economic models. He has extensive experience and understanding of the GAMS economic trading model used by U of I through research done on the Boise Valley Water Use Study Spatial Allocation Model. While working for Reclamation RD Schmidt developed the procedures by which a conjunctive hydrologic model (MODFLOW or GFLOW) could be mathematically coupled to an economic trading model (GAMS). The development of the mathematical expressions necessary to couple these models is unique work developed by Reclamation groundwater specialists (RD Schmidt) and U of I economists while working on the Boise Valley model.This work is unique research and development work and has not been duplicated elsewhere.The mathematical expressions developed by RD Schmidt and U of I are not standard knowledge for hydrologist or economists in the field and has not been published. RD Schmidt's research experience in coupling hydrologic and economic models and his unique knowledge of the GAMS economic trading model used by U of I will be essential to successfully interfacing the MODFLOW hydrologic model outputs with the GAMS model. RD Schmidt's has unique developmental knowledge and experience and understanding of the GAMS model and MODFLOW models and the mathematical expressions necessary to couple these models. Working knowledge of the MODFLOW, GAMS and the mathematical expressions necessary to couple these models is instrumental in evaluating and utilizing demand management tools. Utilizing a different groundwater specialist would require that specialist to replicate the research accomplished under the Boise Valley Water Use study with IDWR and U of I specialist. This would take additional time and investment on Reclamation's part and would also require the cooperation of our partners.   This acquisition is classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690 Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. The size standard as defined by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) for this NAICS code is $6.5 M. Although this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, questions or inquiries may be sent to arenken@pn.usbr.gov. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<SUBJECT>R -- Sole Source
<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract with Indiana University, Transportation Research Center (TRC), 222 West Second Street, Bloomington, IN  47403-1501.  Pursuant to FAR 1.603(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency.   

The Indiana University, TRC is a node in the nationwide Electronic Data System (EDS) network that is managed through the Volpe Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  The Crash Injury Research Engineering Network (CIREN) Centers are other nodes on the same network.  

The Transportation Research Center (TRC) resides within the School of Public and Environmental Affairs (SPEA).  The staff of the Transportation Research Center has been involved in transportation safety-related research and technical assistance since 1970 when TRC?s predecessor, the Institute for Research in Public Safety was created.  The TRC has participated in a broad range of projects for the U.S. Department of Transportation (the vast majority in motor vehicle crash data collection endeavors sponsored by NHTSA) providing experience relevant to the work proposed, including active participation in the area of motor vehicle crash data collection.  As part of their investigative efforts, the TRC has over thirty-five (35) years of experience collecting data pertaining to motor vehicle crashes and has implemented and sustained related management and quality control procedures. 

Since August 2000, TRC staff began development of a CIREN quality control process by reviewing 50 completed cases.  The process was, and remains, an electronic review of completed CIREN cases submitted by current Centers.  The ultimate quality control review goal is to achieve, in a timely manner, the highest degree possible of data completeness, data accuracy, and internal case consistency among and between CIREN cases, specifically, and with other NHTSA-sponsored motor vehicle crash research programs, generally.  To reach that goal, TRC staff rely on the CIREN Manual; accumulated notes from CIREN weekly teleconferences; the NASS Crashworthiness Data System Data Collection, Coding, and Editing Manual; the NASS Injury Coding Manual; the electronic reconstruction program Winsmash; NASS Vehicle Measurements Techniques; NASS Photography Guidelines; and Collision Deformation Classification - SAE J224 Mar80.  In addition, TRC has an existing T-1 line and server to Volpe.  The proposed principals are NASS trained and experienced in crash investigation and reconstruction, quality control procedures as well as the BIO Tab which is unique to CIREN.  

Because of Indiana University, Transportation Research Center?s knowledge of CIREN, VOLPE, and NASS and its ability to work with the NHTSA as well as their expertise in providing Quality Control of the CIREN data, this contract will take advantage of the unique qualifications of the staff at Indiana University?s Transportation Research Center to do this work since they are familiar with the complexities of CIREN data and the requirements for sanitization for personally identifiable information.   

Interested parties that believe they have the performance capability required should send supporting information that documents that belief.  The Government would like to review capability statements and pricing data to determine interest and capability of potential sources for this requirement.  The information provided need not be excessive in length, no more than 15 pages but should be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate that your company understand the nature of work involved, and has the expertise and resources to successfully perform the above requirements. 

The NAICS is 541720.   This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 30 calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be evaluated by the Government.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  

NOTE:   CIREN Centers are not eligible to apply because of potential conflict of interest.

This award will be a Time and Materials Labor Hour contract with a three-year base period and one twenty-four (24) month option period resulting in a total possible performance period of five (5) years.  

Please submit your responses by 2:00pm, February 11, 2008 to Chelly Johnson-Jones, Contract Specialist, 202-366-1943, Office of Acquisition Management, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, S.E., W51-115, Washington, DC  20590 or via e-mail to chelly.johnson-jones@dot.gov

<SUBJECT>--JCS J8 Joint Analytic Support Program III - Request for Information (RFI)
<DESC>Reference previous posting dated 20 December 2007; same subject <BR><BR>JCS J8 Joint Analytic Support Program III  Request for Information<BR>Industry Questions and Answers<BR><BR>1. Format:  Can brochures / marketing material be submitted in PDF fo rmat? <BR><BR>Answer: Yes.<BR><BR>2. The JASP community has undergone significant changes since the award of JASP II.  Organizations that previously had a significant contractor support presence under this vehicle have transitioned to civil servants or oth er contracts to fill their needs, new organizations have come into existence (AFRICOM), technical requirements have changed (including the retirement of older models and the introduction of new, complex simulations), and personnel skills have evolved (eg.,  the need to understand insurgency and stability operations has resulted in the use of applied social scientists under the JASP II vehicle).  The draft PWS and other information provided in this RFI are essentially the same as the equivalent documents asso ciated with the JASP II contract.  Does the Government expect the normal contract requirements development process to result in significant changes to the PWS correspondent to the changes in the JASP landscape?<BR><BR>Answer: It is expected that the JASP I II PWS can/will change to meet the dynamics of the current and envisioned future JASP landscape.  Inputs received by the government from vendors will be taken into account in shaping revisions. <BR><BR>3.  In Task Area 2, Information Technology Support, th e draft PWS states that The contractor shall at a minimum be certified at SEI Capability Maturity Model (CMM) Level Three (3).  Given the very limited amount of software development that is performed under the existing JASP II contract, the significant exp ense associated with achieving this certification, and the fact that all such work is performed in Government facilities and is therefore limited by the processes and procedures permissible within those facilities, this requirement appears to be unnecessar y and over-burdensome.  Would the Government consider removing this requirement?<BR><BR>Answer: Not presently, however, see answer to the next question.<BR><BR>4. If the Government feels the CMM 3 requirement is necessary, then given that this requirement applies only to those Task Orders responsive to Task Area 2, and then only to specific tasks within those Task Orders, must the CMM 3 certification be held by the prime or would it be sufficient to provide a certified subcontractor to perform specific task s calling for CMM 3? <BR><BR>Answer: The government will consider the recommendation to allow the Prime vendor to provide a subcontractor with the CMM 3 certification (or higher) vice having the Prime demonstrate that capability/requirement.<BR><BR>5. Do c ommercial brochures and/or marketing material submissions count against our paper page count?<BR><BR>Answer: No.<BR><BR>6. Can marketing materials be sent to the contracting office in hard copy?  <BR><BR>Answer: Yes<BR><BR>7. Is there a geographical requir ement regarding the location of the Top Secret/SCI Facility?<BR><BR>Answer: It is preferred that such facilities be located w/in a 25 mile radius of the supported command.<BR><BR>8.  Will the government be available to meet with industry to discuss our RFI  responses prior to Industry Day?<BR><BR>Answer: No. This is due to necessity of ensuring full government represention at any such meetings with the vendors.<BR><BR>9. Is this project considered a new requirement?  <BR><BR>Answer: Yes. However, the require ments of JASP III are similar to previous JASP contracts.<BR><BR>10. If this program is not considered a new requirement; a. Who is the incumbent? <BR><BR>Answer: Current JASP Prime Vendors - L3-Com/Titan and Northrop Grumman IT.<BR><BR>11. What is the con tract number? <BR><BR>Answer: W74V8H04DO040 (NGIT) and DO043 (L3-Com/Titan)<BR><BR>12. The sources sought mentions, The company shall possess a TOP SECRET/SCI F acility Clearance (FCL).  Is this to say that the company must have a SCIF or just a Top Secret FCL?  <BR><BR>Answer: Yes.<BR><BR>13. Also, if a SCIF is required, can companies leverage a partner? <BR><BR>Answer: Yes, companies can leverage a partner or le ase such facilities.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>70--Amendment to Sentillion Software MaintenanceJustification and ApprovalResponses due by COB January 11, 2008
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (FAR 6.302-1(c))  1.	Identification of the Agencies: Requesting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs 				VA Central Office  810 Vermont Avenue NW Washington, DC  20420 Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs 				IT Acquisition Center (200/00D3) 				1615 Woodward Street 				Austin, TX  78772 2.	Nature and/or description of the action:  The purpose of this action is to procure Sentillion Vergence Solution Software Maintenance and Sentillion Vault Hardware Maintenance.  Within the scope of the awarded contract, the VA will be able to continue the efficient and effective maintenance of the existing Sentillion Vergence Context Management Solution and Sentillion Vault Hardware throughout VA.  By continuing to consolidate maintenance across the enterprise, this will result in cost effective management of IT solutions which support the VA mission.    This solution has proven to be the only method of maintaining Clinical Context when using different GUI-based applications running on the same workstation in medical centers by forcing those applications to maintain the same patient context regardless of the application, and the ability to inform other GUI applications in a standards-based manner that clinically significant context is being switched by another application. 3.	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencyýýýs needs (including the estimated value): In 2002, the Department of Veterans Affairs purchased a Clinical Context Management Solution which is the Sentillion Vergence Solution and Vault Hardware.  The purpose of this procurement was to provide an ANSI HL7 CCOW (Clinical Context Object Workgroup) standard methodology by which clinical context can be managed between different GUI applications running on the same desktop environment.  The use of this context management solution adheres to the HL7 standards and improves both patient safety and clinician productivity.  The VA acquired software licenses for unlimited users for Sentillionýýýs Vergence Solution and Sentillion Vault Hardware which is now in use across the nation at 285 VA facilities.  The software must be maintained to ensure that users have access to the latest functionality of the applications.  The VA is purchasing maintenance for the software and hardware for a period of 12 months.  The acquisition will also include two 12-month option periods to ensure continuity of software maintenance for the next three years. The Sentillion Vergence Solution provides a means to allow users to access only the information and systems to which they are authorized.  This is done through a front-end security system for single sign-on and through contact management.  Creating and managing user accounts for clinical, business and personal productivity applications is more challenging in healthcare than most other industries. The Sentillion product set enables the management of user base and associated applications while meeting the needs for knowing who the users are and enhancing their productivity while ensuring system security and patient confidentiality.   4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:   This acquisition is conducted under the authority of FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer and 6.302-1(c), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  This is not a sole source justification; rather it is a justification to permit other than full and open competition due to a brand name requirement. 5.	Identification of the justification rationale: VA purchased the Sentillion product set and now needs to continue to provide maintenance on these products to ensure VA is eligible for the latest upgrades to better ensure security of the data.  If maintenance for the Sentillion product set is not continued, VA will need to revert to manual methods for controlling access to medical records.  This product is key in providing VA with the greatest levels of security. The VA has already incorporated this CCOW standard into several of its key clinical applications including Care Management, CPRS Version 22, VISTA Vitals, VISTA Clinical Procedures, VISTA Imaging, and VISTA Radiology.  As VistA software is re-engineered to graphical applications, it is imperative that PATIENT context be maintained between different applications running on the same desktop.   If a new product replaced the Sentillion product, multiple VA GUI applications, such as VA Kernel, Imaging, CPRS, HealtheVet Desktop (aka Care Management), Clinical Case Registry, Vista Web, Veterans ID Card and COTS products such as iMed Consent (and others in process) would have to be rewritten to use the new product.  6.	Sources Solicited: This acquisition will be solicited under the National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) Solution Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC), to all SEWP contract holders (this includes multiple small, veteran owned, woman owned and 8(a) businesses). 7.	Fair and Reasonable Price: Pricing shall be determined fair and reasonable based on competitive quotes, as prescribed in FAR 16.505 (b)(1)(iv). 8.	Market Research Conducted: This procurement will be advertised in FEDBIZOPPS to provide opportunity for any interested bidders to request a copy of the solicitation.  Additionally a Request for Information was posted for review by NASA SEWP IV contract holders containing the following language:  ýýýVA seeks market research information on vendors who can provide an enterprise license for an ANSI HL7 Clinical Context Object Workgroup (CCOW) solution.  CCOW is a standard methodology by which clinical context can be managed between different GUI applications running on the same desktop environment.  The CCOW solution must adhere to the HL7 standards.  This solution will allow users to access only the information and systems to which they are authorized.ýýý

SCOPE OF WORK

Democracy and Governance Program Leader

I.  Background:

USAID/Morocco??s Democracy and Governance (D/G) program aims to support the Government of Morocco (GOM) in its efforts to do a better job of responding to the needs of its citizens in keeping with best practices of good governance.  This work also encourages citizens to engage with government and public administration through representative institutions to better and more effectively express their needs. Within the Arab world, the Kingdom of Morocco is the country where the process of political liberalization has been sustained for the longest period of time.  Morocco has received praise over the past year from those who follow closely the evolution of democracy in the Middle East, but it is clear that much remains to be done.

The D/G program strives to support systems that inform central debates and leadership for improvements over the long term while building a partnership between citizens and government to immediately deliver tangible results at the local level.  Future programming will seek to promote more democratic and participatory governance in order to increase transparency and accountability in the public sector and engage citizens at all levels in their priority policy issues. The current program, Improved Government Responsiveness to Citizens, includes four intermediate results; 1) National Enabling Environment Supported which includes a parliamentary strengthening activity; 2) Transparency in Governance Encouraged; 3) Enhanced Legitimacy and Credibility of Representative Actors at the National and Sub-National Levels; and, 4)  Local Governance Performance Improved,   A new D/G strategy, now being developed as part of USAID??s five-year program strategy for 2009-2013, will build capacity on the demand side of the democracy equation (especially in terms of more effective representation of citizen concerns by civil society, by representative institutions and by political parties) and, on the supply side, will support the development of a more effective, accountable administration at the local and regional levels . Under the new strategy, there will be a strong, across-the-board emphasis on youth and promoting their engagement in Moroccan civic and economic life. As part of that strategy development, specific targets and indicators for the democracy program will be adopted, and the D/G team will be the USAID entity primarily responsible for their achievement.

The D/G Program Leader will serve in the D/G Office, USAID/Morocco.  The incumbent will be expected to work independently, with minimal oversight from the Mission Director, based on a general assignment of responsibilities.  The incumbent will produce an annual work plan for accomplishing complex duties and responsibilities, and will be responsible for daily management of D/G activities.  Due to the high level of responsibility in this position, the D/G Program Leader will have wide latitude in the exercise of her/his duties for program design, management, and evaluation, and for the identification and resolution of issues affecting program performance both within and outside of the Mission.  The incumbent is considered the Mission??s lead democracy expert with all of the duties and responsibilities of a senior USAID officer.

II. Duties and Responsibilities:

The D/G Program Leader will provide leadership, guidance, and overall direction on the development and execution of USAID/Morocco??s activities under the D/G Strategic Objective, both as currently conceived under the Mission??s 2004-2008 Strategic Plan and as finally agreed-upon for the new 2009-2013 strategy.

Specific duties and responsibilities shall include, but are not limited to:

1.	Serves as the senior advisor to the Mission Director and senior GOM officials on policy and programs related to democratic reform.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

Question: Please provide any information about the NRA-certified paper.
Answer:  The NRA has licensed a number of companies to print Official NRA Targets and those companies are also supplied with paper for those Official NRA targets and other targets. USSS requires either NRA certified paper or an equivalent to be considered for award.  Experience has shown that targets must be printed on suitable paper in order to easily score targets with defined bullets holes without rips and tears.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions.  Any questions already submitted that are not answered here are being researched and will be answered in a future amendment.  The question deadline and proposal due date remain unchanged. 

FMC-90121-07-0007-SOL2 - Questions and Answers (Amendment 1)

Is this a new requirement or is there an incumbent?  The incumbent contractor is Document Systems, Inc. 

Is the incumbent eligible to bid?  The FAR does not exclude incumbents from bidding on new contract opportunities.

What are the minimal personnel requirements for these positions?  As stated in the PWS, the FMC requires the contractor to provide one (1) person for 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year, excluding federal holidays.  Please note that this is not a personal service.  

Will Wage Determination and SAP be applied to this contract?  The most current Wage Determination for the Washington, DC metropolitan area will be applied to this contract.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), located in FAR part 13, are applicable to this acquisition, as are others. 

If possible, could you tell me what kind of budget FMC has set aside for this project?  The Independent Government Estimate (IGE) is government sensitive information and may not be disclosed to competing vendors.

Is the government providing all of the hardware, software, and facilities for the contractor to do the work?  Yes.  The contractor will be on-site at the FMC and utilize workstation tools already in place for this effort.

Is the government willing to consider the assignment of additional labor (but less than 40 additional hours/week) to perform an independent quality assurance/management function?  Each vendor is permitted to propose whatever solution they feel would best meet the needs of the FMC.   

Is a site visit possible?  At this time, the government does not feel that a site visit is necessary.

What is the anticipated date of contract award?  Reference PWS section 5, Period of Performance.

If we are a new entity, having no past performance history in performing this type of work for federal agencies, how will our past performance be rated?  If you have no relevant past performance, you must make a statement to that effect.  You will be given a rating of "Neutral" in this area and rated on your price and technical proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

9. What is meant by the "5 control boxes" under A(2)? What is to be controlled?

Requirement is for each of five (5) zones to have a control that allows for adjustment of the white noise level in that specific zone. In addition, conference rooms must have a switch or control that would provide the capability to "turn off" white noise in that specific conference room, for example if an audiovisual presentation or high-profile meeting needed "quiet" to be effective.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Veritas Netbackup 6.5 software licenses, maintenance, and components
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-08Y014169
<RESPDATE>011508
<ARCHDATE>01302008
<CONTACT>Marie Sunday, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-7081, Fax 301-443-2761, Email MARIE.SUNDAY@PSC.HHS.GOV
<DESC>THE CLOSING DATE FOR THIS SOLICITATION IS EXTENDED PENDING THE POSTING OF RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED.


The Department of Health and Human Services/Administration for Children and Families (ACF) has a requirement for Veritas Netbackup 6.5 software licenses, maintenance, and components to provide capability to backup servers, databases, and other intangible data to the offline media.  ACF needs this upgrade (from Version 4.5) as well as the 8x capacity of what ACF currently has, to more efficiently run their backups and protect their production, staging, and development data.  This notice constitutes a request for competitive quotes.  Due to FAR Subpart 19.102(f) - non manufacturer rule, the Small Business Set-Aside does not apply.    

Brand Name Justification:

ACF currently operates Veritas Netbackup 4.5 as the operating system for tape backups in the ACF production environment.  The ACF license has reached end of life, and they have reached a point where support no longer exists.  The ACF backup configuration is predicated on the Veritas Solution.  ACF recently acquired a new Sun Tape Library to satisfy their expanding capacity and the Veritas software is to accompany it to ensure that the existing and expanded assets can be coordinated in their new backup scheme.  The Veritas Netbackup 6.5 software is specifically needed to ensure ACF can backup both the new and the old servers.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested, and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued as a request for quote (RFQ) to solicit interested and qualified vendors for the purpose of awarding a commercial Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  A purchase order will be awarded in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures, and all applicable provisions and clauses are incorporated and in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-22.  The applicable NAICS code is 423430, and the small business size standard is 100 employees.  All responsible sources may submit a quote that shall be considered.
