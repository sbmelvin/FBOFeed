<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health(NCEH), Healthy Homes &amp; Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch, intends to award a sole source, 10 months firm fixed price contract, in accordance with FAR Part 15- Acquisition by Negotiation to the Coalition To End Childhood Lead Poisoning Inc, 2714 Hudson St, Baltimore, MD 21224.
<p>The Coalition To End Childhood Lead Poisoning Inc is the current contractor of work being performed of a previous awarded task order. The unique nature of the projects requires the capacity for the contractor to manage a complex project with national scope at 16 diverse sites across the US. The contractor must possess exceptional skills in partnership building at both the national &amp; local level to leverage resources; expertise in green housing building &amp; remediation; provide strong leadership and organizational structure to coordinate the national involvement at the 16 sites; and have proven success in these areas with CDC and HUD.</p>
<p>This project will result in the establishment of the Green Healthy Housing Initiative (GHHI) pilot in 14 communities to: 1) Promote the development of competent and effective public health workforce by building core capacity of environmental public health professionals. 2) Support the Healthy People 2010 (soon to be 2020) initiative by focusing on Environmental Health, Injury and Violence Prevention, and Public Health Infrastructure. 3) Support the CDC Healthy Places and Healthy Housing Goals. 4) Develop the local infrastructure to demonstrate that the GHHI approach is effective in more comprehensively addressing multiple home-based health hazards in a manner that reduces costs, leverages resources, and produces better health outcomes for occupants. This acquisition is authorized by the program authorization: Section 317(k) (2) of the Public Health Services Act (42 U.S.C. Section 247b (k) (2) <br />There is not another contractor other than the Coalition to End Childhood Lead Poisoning who can continue responsibility for this national 16 site project without jeopardizing accomplishment of the desired goals. The complex nature of this national on-going project requires continuity of contractor management and site coordinator staff, and most importantly, maintaining previously established local and national partnerships at the sites. Because this is sole source procurement, no solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps. We will only issue a solicitation to Coalition To End Childhood Lead Poisoning Inc.<br />CDC anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) permitting other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br />CDC believes that Coalition To End Childhood Lead Poisoning Inc is the only source available to provide this service that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for proposal. A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Interested parties who believe they possess the capability to satisfy this requirement should submit a capability statement demonstrating their ability to meet this requirement. All responses must be sent in writing to Mr. Thaddeus Rollins via email to tnr6@cdc.gov using the reference&nbsp;Coalition To End Childhood Lead Poisoning Inc in the subject line, no later than 11:59 pm Eastern Time, 16 February 2011.</p>

<DESC>This is a market survey for a fully functional USB 2.0 dual-linked mechanical yoke system to be installed in an aircraft simulator.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.  
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing a fully functional USB 2.0 dual-linked mechanical yoke system to be installed in an aircraft simulator.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors.
1.  Capability Statement - This document should identify:	-Type of service provided by your firm;
2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services;
3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8 (a) certified business;
4.  Availability and delivery times of product;
5.  Cost information;

Within this posting is a draft of the statement of work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments.
All responses to this market survey must be received by close of business Thursday, February 3, 2011.  All submittals should be submitted via email to colleen.ctr.mcguire@faa.gov.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Eppendorf North America Inc., 102 Motor Parkway, Hauppauge, New York 11788 to procure epMotion 5075 liquid handler system.

The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives.  The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Disease (TRND), NIH Center for Translational Therapeutics (NCTT) is accountable for the authentication of novel compound probes through cell based assays, animal studies, and ultimately human clinical trials that will lead to the discovery of a pharmaceutical drug. The TRND research laboratory will extend applications related to Cellomics, Genomics, and Proteomics.  The laboratory has multiple liquid dispensers at NCGC, however, none of them allow 96 and 384 well plate handling or handling of DNA/RNA, protein extraction and qPCR. During optimization and validation manual pipetting is relied on, which is tedious and not very accurate. It is of extreme value to TRND to streamline the process with precision. This equipment is needed to extend beyond the existing technology available to NCGC and to execute the new program initiatives. Additionally, the epMotion 5075 system will enable contact free dispensing of samples from the pipette tip into labware reducing the possibility of cross-contamination. The government request Eppendorfs epMotion 5075 system in order to develop and deploy new technology and assays for the screening of rare and neglected disease targets.

Eppendorfs epMotion 5075 unique feature is the Optical confocal infrared detector (optical sensor protected by US patent 6,819,437) liquid detection method and no other system functions this way. This system provides contact free detection of liquid levels, tools used, labware setup and quantities by means of measuring the light reflection of surfaces. Compound testing assays require a high degree of standardization and reproducibility. DMSO is a powerful organic solvent and is widely used for compound dissolution in pharmaceutical and research laboratories. EpMotion pipettes DMSO with excellent accuracy and precision [a CV below 1 % at 5 l and below 0.05% at 1000 l] over a broad volume range. NCGC/TRND Laboratory applications require sterile environment and the free jet dispensing from pipette tools are unique to the EpMotion. This enables contact free dispensing of samples from the pipette tip into labware reducing the possibility of cross-contamination. It has six (6) types of pipetting tools available for use, increasing the application and versatility: a. 1-50&#956;l in single and eight channel heads; 20-300&#956;l in single and eight channel heads; 40-1,000&#956;l in single and eight channel heads. Pipetting tools can be autoclaved at 121 C.  Eppendorfs 2DMix-ControlTM technology, the Thermomixers orbital shaking and perfect balance of speed and mixing radius optimizes resuspension of bacteria pellets or beads. Features include an integrated Thermomixer to shake and heat or cool sample tubes and plates from 4 to 95C that is critical in maintaining the integrity of RNA and qPCR samples. Droplets are prevented from collecting on the side of tubes or plate wells, thus eliminating the need for additional centrifugation steps. Built on the unrivalled liquid handling technology with typically less than 2CV % pipetting error at 1 &#956;l* the epMotion 5075 TMX delivers pure performance to all routine pipetting applications.

Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 423490, Other Professional Equipment and Supplies Merchant Wholesalers, with size standard of 100 employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-49 (January 24, 2011). 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by February 7, 2011, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.

Inquires to this announcement,  referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2011-092-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition,   COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention:  Dorothy Maxwell.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to AA Pharmaceuticals, 470 Wildwood Avenue, Suite 3, Woburn, Massachusetts 01801-2082 for the synthesis of 10 g of 2-((2S,6R)-2,6-dimethylmorpholino)-N-(5-(6-morpholino-4-oxo-4H-pyran-2-yl)-9H-thioxanthen-2-yl) acetamide (KU-660019). 

The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives.  The NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) has several active internal neurodegeneration programs looking for small molecules which can have a therpeutical effect in the neurodegeneration animal model. NCGC is collaborating with UCLA Medical School as part of their internal neurodegeneration projects. Neurodegeneration is the umbrella term for the progressive loss of structure or function of neurons, including death of neurons. Many neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinsons, Alzheimers, and Huntingtons occur as a result of neurodegenerative processes. As research progresses, many similarities appear which relate these diseases to one another on a sub-cellular level. Discovering these similarities offers hope for therapeutic advances that could ameliorate many diseases simultaneously. 

There are many parallels between different neurodegenerative disorders including atypical protein assemblies as well as induced cell death. Neurodegeneration can be found in many different levels of neuronal circuitry ranging from molecular to systemic. Currently there is no effective cure for a number of neurodegeneration diseases. In an initial evaluation already conducted  250 mg of compound has already been synthesized, however, for a long term neurodegeneration disease study (animals will be treated for at least five months), NCGC will need to produce 10 grams of this compound. Therefore, this requirement is to procure 10 g of 2-((2S,6R)-2,6-dimethylmorpholino)-N-(5-(6-morpholino-4-oxo-4H-pyran-2-yl)-9H-thioxanthen-2-yl) acetamide (KU-660019).  AA Pharmaceuticals Inc. has experience for custom synthesizing this compound in the past and has all the needed infrastructure to do this work. Additionally, AA Pharmaceuticals Inc. has the expertise and knowledge of NHGRI and specifically the research need for the NIH Chemical Genomics Center.

The Contractor:


  The Contractor will deliver 10g of 2-((2S, 6R)-2,6-dimethylmorpholino)-N-(5-(6-morpholino-4-oxo-4H-pyran-2-yl)-9H-thioxanthen-2-yl)acetamide (KU-660019) according to the synthetic schemes provided by NCGC scientists with an estimated timeline of 10-12 weeks. 

  The Contractor will report the progress of synthesis every week to NCGC by e-mail or teleconference, and discuss questions and problems in a timely manner. The final 10 grams of KU-66019 submitted to NCGC will have LC-MS and NMR spectrum data.

Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology, 
with size standard of 500 employees, this is a small business set-aside. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001).and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-49 (January 24, 2011).

To understand the mechanism to these diseases and pursue potential therapeutic approaches, the NINDS scientists have generated both collagen type XII mouse model and collagen type VI mouse model.  In addition to understand the disease at molecular level, the NINDS scientists also need to assess the function of muscle by measuring its contractile forces.  This is also critical to evaluate the efficacy of various potential treatments for these groups of disease.  Sensitive and reproducible physiological assessments of muscle function in mouse models are critical to understand the mechanism of disease and therapeutic potential of muscular dystrophy and atrophy.  The NINDS scientists need a complete muscle test system to measure contractile functions of both isolated muscles and muscles in situ which has its nerve and blood supply preserved.  As in for each animal, more than one muscle will be examined, it is important to finish the examination after the muscles are isolated from the animal or separated from the surrounding tissue.  For that reason, it is essential that the NINDS scientists to have a second complete test system to perform the experiments simultaneously.  

The Aurora model 1200A 1.0N in vitro Muscle Test System consists of the following:  1.0N (100 gram) Dual-Mode System with three-year warranty; windows PC, Quad-core, 4GB RAM, 500 GB HDD, DVD, Win 7; National Instruments PCI-6221M A/D card; A/D Signal Interface  for use with 603C A/D Card; 22 Widescreen LCD Monitor; DMC/ DMA software; Constant current/ constant voltage field stimulator; In vitro test apparatus for 300C; in situ Muscle apparatus for 300C/ 305C.

A 1200A 1.0N in vitro Muscle test system was previously purchased from Aurora and has been used by the scientist to collect data and prepare the experiment.  To keep the consistency and continuity of the project, the NINDS seeks to purchase the same instrument from Aurora Scientific Inc.  The 1200A 1.0N in vitro Muscle Test System is a proprietary product and be available only from Aurora Scientific Inc.  There is no known source of supply or distributor in the United States.  It is therefore determined that Aurora is the only source for the required item.  

Delivery shall be FOB destination, Bethesda, Maryland and is required within 60 days after receipt of order.

No solicitation will be issued.  This Notice of Intent is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ); however, responsible sources interested in this solicitation may submit a statement of capabilities to Liem T Nguyen, ln18x@nih.gov on or before 2:00 P.M ET February 10, 2011.

<SUBJECT>Request For Information (RFI)  Letter Generation Systems
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFI-11-1005
<RESPDATE>021411
<CONTACT>Sean Frey, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109669446, Email sean.frey@ssa.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><br />Introduction:</p>
<p>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Reference SSA-RFI-11-1005 when responding to this announcement. SSA is seeking responsible vendors that are capable of providing a centrally managed solution for letter generation.</p>
<p>At present, the Social Security Administration (SSA) uses printed and mailed letters for all formal and most informal communication with its various benefit recipients and business partners. Many disparate computer systems use different internally developed architectures to prepare these notices. Generally, these SSA computer programs offer several letter and paragraph libraries to create their substance and format. SSA staff sometimes hands these notices to its recipients in person, but more often, either the agency or a contractor centrally print them and deliver them by US Mail. The agency achieves customization through the selection of the letter type, paragraphs, fill-ins for paragraphs, and the inclusion of customized text.</p>
<p>SSA is conducting market research on how to consolidate its various letter generation systems and provide communications by methods in addition to US mail, such as, but not limited to, e-mail. Its goals are to reduce Information Technology (IT) and programmatic maintenance costs, increase communication management capabilities, reduce costs by using delivery means other than US Mail, and improve public service by offering additional communications options to SSA clients. SSA seeks information about IT products or services that might meet these goals.</p>
<p>The following subject headings are specific areas of interest to SSA. You must organize your response by these headings. Your response should address briefly how you propose to meet the requirements under each of these headings. It should include comparable examples of where your company has already applied the potential solution. The agency will not evaluate responses that are too long or poorly organized. For any of the headings, you may recommend solutions your company does not offer. SSA prefers but does not require a single managed solution. SSA prefers the use of commercially proven products and solutions. SSA prefers that options potentially owned or managed by SSA operate in a generic service-oriented web application server environment. Please identify hosting requirements and options for proposed solutions, including whether the solutions can be hosted as a service in third party facilities. SSA permits the offering of open source based products as long as commercial support for the open source product is also available.</p>
<p><br />Content Authoring and Management:</p>
<p>SSA requires a centrally managed solution for document language and template authoring, incorporating the ability to create, edit, collaborate, and publish approved document content in a centrally managed environment that will serve as single authoritative source for the agency. A potential solution must store content separately from formatting to render text as required by a variety of current and future delivery methods for communications. The content authoring facility must include the ability to manage content in multiple languages, initially in English and Spanish. Proposed solutions must include the migration of language used in its current systems into any future system. SSA currently has about 20,000 paragraphs and 5,000 templates. A potential solution must include content management and search facilities, and must maintain and track all versions of the same content eventually used for production purposes Also, it must provide a flexible language development environment to support the workflow of the collaborative SSA language development and release process. The design should provide a mechanism for detailed and customizable management information and reporting. <br /><br /><br />Content Composition:</p>
<p>SSA will continue its current practice of having separate business programs generate a selection of templates, paragraphs, fill-ins, tables, illustrations and free format text to serve as content for a new communication management system. These separate content generation programs are not a part of this RFI. A potential solution must provide a single uniform standards-based interface to serve as the interface between business programs and the communication management system. This interface must initially accept information (such as a specific name), and permit future use of data references (such as the location of a specific name) and separately executed communication business logic (such as a request to create an award letter for this specific person using this specific data instance). A potential solution must support multiple languages, both by receiving the request in the issuing language and in a neutral format with the content output created in the requested language. It must maintain detailed management information related to the source of communication requests, content selections, and volumes.</p>
<p><br />Content Rendering:</p>
<p>A potential solution must properly format the substance of the communication and render it for the target delivery mechanism. It may render the same communication at different times using various formats and delivery mechanisms. This implies a separation between content and format. Currently, SSA uses enclosures. While the agency will continue to use enclosures for interim letter production, it anticipates attaching the content of stuffers on demand without maintaining any inventory. A potential solution must render content using a variety of different markup outputs such as PCL, AFP, PDF and HTML. It must make content available for accessibility purposes, for example, in audio and Braille formats, and render communications on IT equipment that is Section 508 compliant. SSA currently produces about 350 million notices per year.<br /><br /><br />Communication storage:</p>
<p>SSA staff must have a historical record of the exact communication rendered and delivered. This includes the parameters used to generate the communication, when it was initiated and by whom, how and when it was delivered, and the delivery methods used. The potential solution must also allow for its reissuance by the same or different delivery mechanisms and formats. It must allow SSA staff the ability to run queries against stored notices to augment management information, perform other analytic and program management functions, and perform bulk actions on stored notices.</p>
<p><br />Content Delivery:</p>
<p>A potential solution must provide various delivery options using different formats and devices. Agency staff may personally hand printed material to a recipient or deliver it by US mail or other means. A potential solution should allow the agency to notify recipients electronically and through electronic repositories such as web sites. Electronic communications should be available both in plain text and encrypted. In most cases, SSA will send an unencrypted message to a customer notifying them that a communication is now available at a secure SSA web site. Authentication and encryption management are not part of this RFI; SSA will manage them separately. A potential solution must have the ability to automatically or optionally execute rerouting of undelivered items or other management functions. A potential solution must provide detailed management information related to delivery methods and outcomes. Many products which might support outbound communications initiated by SSA also support inbound customer initiated communications. Please describe any support for these customer-initiated communications.</p>
<p><br />Communication Notification Management:</p>
<p>Recipients of SSA communications should have interactive web based channels available, such as a web portal, to view available communications. These include communications previously issued, redelivery requests, and those with altered future delivery and selection methods. A potential solution should offer a subset of communication options using interactive voice response (IVR).</p>
<p><br />Conclusion:</p>
<p>Interested vendors must provide verifiable proof in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to meet the Agency's requirement, see URL site http://www.socialsecurity.gov/oag/acq/oagacq_508.htm. Any solution must be compatible with applicable Federal Government Section 508 standards. Vendors having the capability to meet the above requirements are invited to submit complete details. The responses shall clearly state the ability to meet the above requirements. Interested parties shall respond to this notice within 15 calendar days from date of this publication. Vendors shall provide the names and contact information of customers. References may be checked. Vendors responding shall indicate whether their services are available on the GSA Federal Supply Schedules. Pricing data may be submitted. This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the data received. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in SSA's assessment of capable sources. No Faxed responses. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. No formal solicitation is being issued at this time. Please submit electronic responses only to the contract specialist identified herein. NOTE: There is a size limit for e-mail: No submission shall be greater than 5 MB.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide local guard services at the U.S. Mission Tunisia. The Mission requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in this performance Work Statement (PWS). <br /><br />
<p>The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State intends to award a time and materials contract, with firm-fixed price and cost reimbursable elements, for local guard services, on behalf of the U.S. Mission Tunisia. The Government will solicit this requirement as a full and open competition using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The Government plans to award one contract as a result of this acquisition.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options, which shall be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government. The estimated number of annual hours for guard services at this location is approximately 264,940 hours.</p>
<p>All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract.</p>
<p>The Project Manager must possess a Level 3 English and Arabic language proficiency, which requires an ability to speak each respective language with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations on practical, social, and professional topics.</p>
<p>The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: the synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days. On or about February 15, 2011, the Government plans to post the solicitation. No paper copies will be mailed. The Government plans to conduct a Site Visit at the U.S. Embassy in Tunis approximately&nbsp;fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after the release of the solicitation.&nbsp; Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit proposals. A contract is expected to be awarded within 120 days of proposal submission. All dates are subject to change.</p>
<p>The Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) period opens with the posting of the synopsis and ends&nbsp;ten (10) calendar days after the Site Visit. Offerors may inquire about security risks by specific countries during this period. The solicitation, when finalized, will be available on the Internet at www.fedbizopps.gov.</p>
<p>All announcements and amendments made to the solicitation will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov. To receive updates, click on "Register to Receive Notification". Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to&nbsp;Neil Kern&nbsp;at <a href="mailto:KernNM@state.gov">KernNM@state.gov</a>. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>All proposals from responsible vendors will be evaluated if received on time. All prospective offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award. In accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the offeror who submitted a technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The ESTCP Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for innovative energy technology demonstrations that address DoD requirements as candidates for funding.  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2).  Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare ESTCP's intent to competitively fund demonstration projects as described in the Program Announcement on the DoD ESTCP web site.  <BR><BR>The Program Announcement which includes specific topics and complete submittal instructions are found at:<BR><BR>www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/ESTCP-Solicitations/Energy-Solicitation<BR><BR>No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made.  Awards will take the form of contracts.  Submission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  The government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan. <BR><BR>To be eligible for consideration, readers wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with the Instructions on the web site, no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Time on Thursday, March 24, 2011.  <BR><BR>No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.  <BR><BR>Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a two-stage review process.  The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit technology demonstrations for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal.  Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by the Government, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether the Government encourages or does not encourage the submission of a full proposal.  Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, the Government will not provide debriefs on those that are not requested to submit a full proposal.<BR><BR>Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification.  A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award.  There is no commitment by ESTCP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any money expended by the offeror before contract award is made.  Multiple awards may be made to address a particular topic area.  It is expected that awards totaling approximately $20.0 million will result depending on availability of funds.  <BR><BR>Small Business Participation Plans (SBPP) are strongly encouraged as the government goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represents 5 percent of the total contract value.  SBPP should be submitted with the full proposal only.  A SBPP is in addition to a subcontracting plan and both large and small vendors need to submit a SBPP to receive maximum credit.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 and 541330 with the small business size standard of 500 employees /$4.5M respectively. In addition, contract proposals that exceed $650,000 submitted by all but small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Woman-Owned, Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  The HECSA Small Business Office web site at www.hecsa.usace.army.mil/hxsb provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate.  <BR><BR>The HECSA point of contact for non-technical contracting issues is Ms. Susan Hill, Susan.M.Hill@usace.army.mil or telephone at 703-428-6420 and for the subcontracting plan is Jackie Robinson-Burnette, Jackie.L.Robinson-Burnette@usace.army.mil or telephone at 202-761-8789.

9.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  Interested contractors should continue to monitor the NECO web sites for additional information and documents relating to this requirement.

The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI. Further, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals or any cost or pricing data. Personal Services contractors are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be the sole responsibility of the contractor. All submissions will be treated as business confidential materials, become Government property, and will not be returned.

Background

The VA- Health Administration Center (HAC) has undertaken the initiative, pursuant to the Administrative Simplification subtitle to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  (HIPAA) of 1996, published as the Final Rule, CMS-0013-F,  on January 16, 2009 , by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requiring covered entities, to implement  the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10 CM) for diagnosis coding and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10 PCS) code sets by the compliance date of October 1, 2013.
The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to provide the resources needed, duration of the effort and estimated cost in performing IT development to adopt the ICD-10 Code Sets claims processing with existing technology at the HAC through its existing IT Infrastructure as documented in the attached ICD-10 Analysis Specification.
 
The scope of work for this requirement is contained within the Cache environment. Detailed business requirements are being developed according to these major and existing processes and systems. 

a.	Pre-Authorization Process 
b.	Ancillary Claims Process 
c.	Benefits Calculations
d.	Claims Processing System: 
i.	External Interfaces
ii.	Screens
iii.	Reports
iv.	Edits
e.	Claims Adjudication Business Rules: Artificial Intelligence (AI)
f.	Code Set Load

Beginning October 1, 2013, the HAC will require, from its business partners, the receipt of ICD-10 CM and ICD-10 PCS codes for all paper and electronic medical outpatient claims with a date of service on or after October 1, 2013 and all inpatient claims with a date of discharge on or after October 1, 2013 processed at the HAC. Currently, HAC utilizes the ICD-9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes in the processing of paper and electronic medical claims at the HAC.  These requirements are necessary for HAC to meet HIPAA compliance. 
Assumptions: 
"	The proposed solution will be designed and developed within the existing architecture and framework of the HAC existing legacy systems as described in the accompanying document, ICD-10 Analysis Specifications.

"	The required methodology will be derived from the VA OI&T Project Management Accountability System (PMAS). 
o	VA will establish a minimum set of deliverable software development artifacts, drawn from the library of available documents within PMAS. 
o	VA will establish time increments for significant customer-facing deliverables not to exceed six months, beginning with initial date of hands-on development and continuing until completion of project development.

"	Note: Above description of scope of work is separate from supplemental work


 Written responses should address the following:

1.   Project Management Plan (PMP):  Based on an analysis of the documentation provided, create a high level project plan that provides estimates for the following:

"	Milestones - Milestone dates should begin at award and assess business days
"	Total time to complete the project - Total estimated number of work days  
"	Associated project staffing - Project team resources
"	Rough Order of Magnitude- estimated price for completing work

2.  Technical and Management (T&M) Approach - Provide a mid-level written report of no more than 10 pages outlining the recommended program management and technical approach to organizing the work and ensuring valid results. 
3.  Prior Performance - Provide no more than 3 examples, of no more than 1 page each, of prior performance in projects of a similar scope and nature and demonstrate technical expertise in the following areas: 
"	Functional requirements involved in adoption of ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS adoption in a health care claims adjudication environment, 
"	HIPAA Compliant Health Care Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) transactions,
"	IT systems integration activities and their associated design, construction, development, testing, implementation and deployment.
"	All technologies/programming languages applicable to this RFI

For each example of prior performance, the following information shall be submitted:
"	GSA contract information including expiration date.
"	Project start and completion dates
"	Technical and business points of contact

4.  Alternative Solution:  As part of its ICD-10 initiative, VA is considering a solution that would provide a complete replacement, rather than a modification, of the Claims Adjudication Business Rules (AI System) and Benefit Calculation sub-systems of Cache with a service-oriented, modularized and GUI-interfaced rules engine within the architecture and framework of the HAC existing legacy systems. The AI rules engine would function to allow non-developers to script rules logic.  

In a separate page document of no more than 2 pages, please address how this alternative solution will impact the estimated rough order of magnitude, time to complete work and schedule impact on the primary work.  

Additional Submission Information Required

Please include, at a minimum, the following information in the initial paragraph of the submission:

"	Vendor Information, including point of contact
"	Website
"	GSA and/or GWAC. Please include number, expiration date, etc.
"	Socioeconomic data
"	Tax ID

<p>The Department anticipates that the summary should be 20-30 pages in length. The audience is primarily the Secretary and Undersecretaries of the Department of Agriculture; it is assumed that the public, advocacy and trade groups, such as agricultural trade groups, will also read and refer to this document in the future. As a result, a neutral voice and approach to the narrative summary is crucial.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) PMA-207 (Tactical Airlift, Adversary &amp; Support Aircraft Program Office) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) as part of a market research and information gathering process to determine the availability of sources capable of providing the following supplies and services for one to nine Department of the Navy (DON) KC-130R: (1) Regeneration; (2) Depot-Level overhaul; (3) Avionics upgrade; (4) Other modifications; (5) Training (flight and ground maintenance); and (6) Contract Logistics Support (CLS).
<p>The DON retired nine KC-130R aircraft between 2005 and 2008. These aircraft are currently preserved at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) in Tucson, Arizona awaiting acquisition by either U.S. or International customers. The KC-130R was first delivered to the DON in 1975 and is equivalent to a United States Air Force (USAF) C-130H1 aircraft. It has structural, fuel, and hydraulic provisions for Sargent Fletcher refueling pods installed on each outer wing. The nine KC-130R aircraft have accumulated an average of 17,500 Flight Hours and an average of 20,875 Center Wing equivalent flight hours (EFH). <br /><br />In preparation of request for pricing and availability information from U.S. or International customers, NAVAIR is seeking to collect the Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) pricing and availability data for three DON KC-130R aircraft.</p>
<p>Interested parties are requested to provide the following Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) pricing and availability data:</p>
<p>The following general assumptions should be used in developing the requested ROM data: Assumptions: (1) That the efforts identified under subparagraphs 1 to 4 can start between 1 Jan 2013 to 31 Dec 15 and be finished between 1 Jan 2016 to 31 Dec 18; (2) All aircraft have been out of operation since 12/2005; (3) All aircraft are baselined with the same avionics identified under attachment 3. (4) That the efforts identified under subparagraph 5 to 7 can start between 1 Jan 2016 to 31 Dec 18.</p>
<p>Please submit pricing and availability and suggested approach for some or all of the discrete program elements listed below, to include applicable rules, schedules, and synopsis of their capabilities, facilities, and relevant experience in the depot overhaul and logistics support of KC-130R aircraft.

<a href="mailto:charles.j.bartlett@us.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>This is a request for Interested Sources for the Software, Materials, and Services needed to procure on-going Clinical Information System Sustainment Support (Essentris Brand Name Software or Equal) for the Military Health System.<BR><BR>Services include software and hardware sustainment, technical and customer support, proactive automated system monitoring and alerting, repair service, replacement parts, software updates, and configuration assistance.  This requirement will also provide a range of customer support services at both the MTF and program office level. The Period of Performance for this effort will be one (1) eight-month base year with three (3) twelve-month option periods, as well as a three (3) month optional transition out period. <BR><BR>Currently, CliniComp International supports the MHS Clinical Information Systems Sustainment Support through it's Essentris Software.  CliniComp is the only contractor that can provide proprietary services and equipment for the Essentris system, due to the fact that CliniComp has not licensed the resale right to maintain the Essentris software to any other contractors.  <BR><BR>It is the Government's belief that there are no other Vendors who can provide Essentris Software and that procuring alternative systems would be cost prohibitive and cause extensive delays (estimated at a minimum of one year) in establishing the current level of DIACAP security and productivity.  <BR><BR>This request is to determine interested sources who feel they can provide the stated requirements.  <BR><BR>The following is a description of the requirement:<BR><BR>1.0	SCOPE<BR>This award provides for services to provide operational support and sustainment for 59 currently existing Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) with Clinical Information System (CIS) products.  Services include software and hardware sustainment, technical and customer support, proactive automated system monitoring and alerting, repair service, replacement parts, software updates, and configuration assistance.  <BR><BR>1.0.1	Background<BR>The Clinical Information Technology Program Office (CITPO) and Theater Medical Information Program - Joint (TMIP-J) merged on June 2, 2008, to form the Defense Health Information Management System (DHIMS) program office. The new program office eliminates organizational redundancies, streamlines operations and enhances the delivery of much needed information technology solutions to all Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries. The combined programs advance efforts to document seamlessly and electronically the health care provided by military authorized providers to all Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps personnel, retirees and their families. <BR><BR>DHIMS is committed to delivering clinical IT solutions that enable quality continuity of care and timely administration of benefits. DHIMS's primary focus is on enhancing usability of the military's Electronic Health Record (EHR) by improving system speed, reliability, data quality, and usability (look and feel) of the product to better meet the needs of the military's medical community.<BR><BR>ESSENTRIS<BR>Essentris, a COTS product, is a mission-critical comprehensive clinical documentation system for use in Services' treatment facilities since 1988.  CIS is a state of the art system with the following key components: a) patient chart that includes flow sheets, treatment notes, medication administration, care plans and integrated order entry, b) automated collection and charting of physiologic data from monitors, and c) real-time reporting and analytics.  All clinical documentation is created and stored in the CIS.  <BR><BR>The Military Health System's (MHS) inpatient documentation solution, CIS, is a comprehensive clinical documentation system for use in acute care hospitals. It captures point-of-care data from physiological devices, fetal/uterine devices, ventilators and other patient care machines at the patient's bedside. All clinical documentation is created and stored in the CIS. This clinical data may be aggregated, trended, and analyzed to manage care for a single patient or for an entire patient population. The key capabilities are:<BR>- Information sharing with the Veterans Affairs (VA) via the Bidirectional Health Information Exchange (BHIE)<BR>- Admissions, Discharge, and Transfer (ADT) Interface to Composite Health Care System (CHCS) (HL-7) <BR>- Outbound laboratory, microbiology, and radiology orders to CHCS <BR>- Inbound laboratory, microbiology, and radiology results from CHCS<BR>- Global Data Repository (GDR)-local relational database of all data elements for trending and analysis <BR><BR>The system is currently deployed in Air Force, Navy and Army CIS sites.  As a deployed application, Essentris is in a sustainment mode at 38 sites and requires hardware and software maintenance.  Additionally, as a deployed automated information system, Essentris requires periodic information assurance evaluations.    <BR><BR>AHLTA<BR>AHLTA is the military EHR supporting the 9.1 million beneficiaries of the Military Health System (MHS) TRICARE Program. Currently being deployed on a global scale, AHLTA supports Force Health Protection (FHP) for DoD service members while deployed abroad as well as health services provided their family members and other beneficiaries in military medical facilities "back home". Providing around-the-world and around-the-clock access to a single data repository of all treatment episodes provided to TRICARE beneficiaries allows AHLTA to support a virtual, longitudinal electronic record that extends the concept of portability far beyond that reached by other EHRs. This global data repository ensures healthcare providers always have access to current, legible information to support the delivery of high-quality health care including population health, wellness, and disease management activities. The EHR will support FHP, Population Health Improvement (PHI), and MHS Optimization. This support will allow the MHS to track clinical care and exposures of deployed units, monitor demand-management effectiveness, better understand disease prevalence and prevention, as well as study both clinical and management outcomes. The EHR will also support the readiness mission of military forces with seamless communication capabilities back to the sustaining base. <BR><BR>AHLTA is in use at all military Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) with more than 60,000 trained users capturing nearly 560,000 outpatient encounters each week. More than 42 million encounters are now documented in the Clinical Data Repository (CDR). This information is now available to authorized AHLTA providers around the globe 24 hours a day regardless of which medical facility the patient appears at for treatment. The AHLTA CDR integrates patient data into a central database of individual lifetime records for easy retrieval and clinical analysis, and provides efficient, centralized access to patients' records at the point of care. To facilitate continuity of care, the CDR was pre-populated with 25 months of patient data from legacy systems and currently contains more than 8.7 million online patient records for individual TRICARE beneficiaries. <BR><BR>AHLTA is configured to meet the DoD's specialized requirements for delivery of care in environments that span from the forward deployed medic to the largest medical centers. Implementing a single solution used in all care environments ensures a complete medical record, including data from the theater of operations, is compatible with the DoD Command and Control system giving Commanders a clear view of what is going on medically in the field. <BR>In its current state, AHLTA relies on legacy Composite Health Care System for many capabilities including order entry and results retrieval, as well as laboratory, radiology, and pharmacy services. AHLTA interfaces to the VA through CHDR.<BR><BR>Composite Health Care System (CHCS)<BR>The CHCS is one of the most broadly deployed medical information systems in the world and it serves as the core medical information system for the DoD. Regardless of where military health care providers are assigned around the world, they have the same medical information system available to them facilitating the delivery of quality patient care to 9.1 million TRICARE beneficiaries. In 2004, CHCS was used to support more than 30 million appointments, 55 million prescriptions, 43 million laboratory tests, and 5 million radiology procedures.<BR><BR>CHCS continues to be one of the most broadly used Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) systems in the Nation. This powerful system enables DoD providers to electronically order laboratory tests, retrieve test results, authorize radiology procedures and prescribe medications. Reducing the risk of illegible orders and completing drug interaction and appropriateness checks, the CPOE functionality of CHCS continues to safeguard care provided to our MHS beneficiaries. For patients, CHCS facilitates improvements in the delivery of health care that reduce wait time, increase access to medical and professional resources, and expedite diagnostic testing. For providers, CHCS promotes increased communication and supports near real-time access to local patient information. <BR><BR>Functional capabilities include patient registration, admission, disposition, and transfer; outpatient administration data; appointment scheduling; laboratory data; drug interaction alerts; quality assurance, radiology results; clinical dietetic administration; pharmacy alerts; computerized order entry and results retrieval; ad hoc reporting; and managed care. <BR><BR>CHCS shares secure, encrypted data electronically with commercial reference laboratories and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, and interfaces with more than 40 other clinical and administrative systems. Systems CHCS interfaces with include: the VA Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy system; TRICARE Online; Pharmacy Data Transaction Service; Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support program; Third Party Outpatient Collection System; Defense Blood Standard System; and the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. <BR><BR><BR>1.0.3	Objectives<BR>The objectives of this Task Order (TO) are to provide operational support and sustainment for currently existing Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) with Clinical Information System (CIS) products.  Services include software and hardware sustainment, technical and customer support, proactive automated system monitoring and alerting, repair service, replacement parts, software updates, and configuration assistance.  This TO will also provide a range of customer support services at both the MTF and program office level.  <BR><BR>Please provide interested sources/feedback via e-mail to Mr. Charles Bartlett at charles.bartlett@amedd.army.mil.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Yakima Field Office, proposes to enter into a contract with Coast Crane Company for the immediate repair of a 1999 Grove 40 ton mobile crane ,Wheel MTD, model TMS  540.The authority for use of other than full and open competition for this transaction is FAR 6.302- 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements(1) When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by --(i) Unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities
 The cited authority must be used because only the proposed contractor possesses the following unique qualifications which are required for this acquisition and is the only practicable method of acquisition due to the nature of the supplies or services to be acquired as follows:Crane repair and modifications that are not authorized by the crane manufacturer may result in the same liability risks and warranty problems that flow from the use of non-complying replacement parts.  OSHA regulations prohibit modifications or additions which affect the capacity or safe operation of a crane unless the crane manufacturer's written approval has been obtained.  Non-authorized repairs and modifications may compromise the original equipment design as well as have a detrimental affect on performance.As per the following exerts from The Power Crane & Shovel Association: The Power Crane & Shovel Association explores business issues, technological questions and legislative and regulatory concerns (domestic and worldwide) that affect manufacturers of cranes.  It also promotes the standardization and simplification of terminology and classification of cranes for worldwide harmonization and provides services tailored to meet the needs of the lattice boom and truck crane industry.  Proper care, maintenance, servicing and repair of cranes by trained personnel are of prime importance in assuring the proper operation of the unit.  It is essential that the recommendations of the crane manufacturer recommended whenever a crane is serviced.  Use of manufacturer recommended replacement parts is vitally important to avoid compromising the crane's performance, reliability, warranty and certification. 
Use of non-OEM or "non-complying replacement parts" (i.e., parts not authorized  by the crane manufacturer or not in compliance with established requirements, specifications and quality standards) can result in equipment malfunction which can result in a potentially unsafe workplace situation and liability exposure for the part manufacturer, the servicing dealer and his customer.  Use of unauthorized replacement parts by a dealer can void the warranty on a crane and put a customer and other parties in a position of being responsible for an' authorized alteration to the crane.
No further notice or solicitation will result from this announcement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. 
A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.    Inquiries will be accepted via e-mail to cmorgan@usbr.gov.

<CONTACT>Vicki M Dinardi, Phone 6175655031, Email vicki.dinardi@gsa.gov
<DESC>The Government has excercized a ten year renewal option for Lease number LCT04157 for the Social Security Administration in Meriden, CT that will be effective 2/1/2011.&nbsp; The annual rent under the renewal option shall be $163,344.00 for 6,806 rentable square feet of office space.<br /><br />The Government has determined that the current lessor has a sufficient history of past performance.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Government has determined that the cost of the renewal option is fair and reasonable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The existing location has already been altered to meet SSA needs. This includes special alterations and LAN systems installed to accommodate this agency. A relocation would require the duplication of this work and its associated cost would result in a much higher rental rate in replacement space. Also, the costs to physically relocate this agency and their telecommunications systems would result in increased costs to the Government. In addition the agency cannot commit to a term longer than 18 months at this time and this renewal option allows us to retain our termination rights. All of these factors combine to make the current Lessor uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The following comparable locations were found:<br />&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The option rate for a Full Service lease at the current location is $24.00/RSF. Given SSA's requirement for an 18 month firm term the TI allowance would have to be amortized over 18 months which at 6% interest results in a $30.55 TI rate which would make moving cost prohibitive as this would make the full service rate for all other locations approximately double the rent for the current location.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<DESC>Attached is the solicitation for the Gravel Hauling requirement for the Dugway Range. This is a 100% competitive HUBZONE set-aside per SBA. No quotes will be accepted if a company does not have the HUBZONE certification through the SBA. All questions concerning the HUBZONE certifications should be routed to the Small Business Administration.
<p>If you are interested in a site visit there will be one at the Dugway Range&nbsp;10 Feb 11 at 10:30 AM. Be at the Dugway gate at least 30 minutes early&nbsp;to start the entrance process. Please be aware the roads at Dugway are rugged and contractors are advised to drive an off roading vehicle to the site. Please fill out the attached UTTR Visit Request document I have attached to the solicitation. These will need to be turned in NLT&nbsp;08 Feb&nbsp;11 by 1200 Mountain Time in order to have you cleared for access to the range.</p>
<p>Below are driving directions to the range for the site visit.</p>
<p>The gate you are looking for is the main gate for Dugway Proving Grounds. On the letter attached from the Det 1 Lt Col Keene, it gives directions on how to get there from Salt Lake. It says: <br />There are two main routes into DPG:</p>
<p>a. Route 1 (mountain pass suitable for small vehicles): From I-80 take exit 99 southbound toward Tooele on Hwy 36. Go south for approximately 21 miles to Hwy 199. Turn right on Hwy 199 and continue for approx. 24 miles through Johnson's Pass to the Dugway main gate.</p>
<p>b. Route 2 (suitable for hauling purposes): From I-80 take exit 77 southbound. Go south on Hwy 196 through Skull Valley for approximately 38 miles to the Dugway main gate. Be aware that you will be traveling through open range country with horses and cattle free ranging.</p>
<p>Also, the work being accomplished will be on the South Range accessed from Dugway Proving Grounds. This will NOT be taking place on the North Range (Oasis).</p>

<p>BASIS FOR AWARD: The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation is responsive to this solicitation and is determined to be the best value to the Government, using the tradeoff approach. Selection of the best value to the Government will be achieved through a process of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each quoter's quotation against the evaluation criteria described below. In determining the best value to the Government, the Technical Capability and Past Performance Evaluation Criteria, when combined, are more important than the evaluated price. The Government is more concerned with obtaining a superior Technical Capability quotation than making an award at the lowest evaluated price. However, the Government will not make an award at a price premium it considers disproportionate to the benefits associated with the evaluated superiority of one technical quotation over another. Thus, to the extent that quoter's technical and past performance quotations are evaluated as close or similar in merit, the evaluated price is more likely to be a determining factor.<br /><br />EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations (these factors are listed in their relative order of importance):</p>
<p>Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price. Factor 1 - Technical Capability: (a) Contract Requirements. Quotations will be evaluated on the quoter's ability to provide all the contract requirements relating to meeting space, audiovisual equipment and technical support, food and beverage service and menu options, and lodging. Quotations must address the quoter's ability to meet or exceed the requirements of the ADA, as&nbsp;amended by the ADA Amendments Act as it relates to the facility conference space, lodging, and parking. Quotations will be evaluated on the&nbsp;quality of customer services provided, the layout design and quality of the&nbsp;facilities as reflected by the physical layout and atmosphere of meeting space, the&nbsp;maintenance and upkeep of the facilities including&nbsp;amenities to support the conference such as free wi-fi in the conference space.&nbsp; (b) Availability of Dates. Quoters will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide the required services on the dates requested. Additional consideration will be given to quotations which demonstrate availability of facilities on the preferred dates in order of preference, i.e. 1st choice date, 2nd choice date, and 3rd choice date. (c) Location. Quotations will be evaluated on the ability of the quoter to provide a facility within the following U.S. Postal Code areas: 30301 through 30350, or 30517, with adequate low cost or free parking for participants and presenters. Site Visits: The EEOC reserves the right to conduct a site visit of all quoters who are rated to be technically acceptable. The site visit will review and evaluate the same technical items identified in the Technical Capabilities Portion of the technical evaluation factors.<br /><br />Factor 2 - Past Performance: The quoter must provide a minimum of three (3) references for past performance of similar work performed within the past three (3) years. The information for each reference shall include the following: 1. Name and address of government agency or non-government client; 2. Name, title, email and telephone number of Contracting Officer, or other point of contact; 3. Name, title, email and telephone number of client's program or project manager, if applicable; 4. Contract number, period of performance, and total dollar value of contract; and 5. Description of services provided. EEOC will evaluate past performance in terms of customer service on similar requirements, feedback from references on quality/upkeep of the facilities and d&eacute;cor, and the availability of amenities and staff to support the conference (e.g., high-speed internet, etc). In the event that a quoter has no Past Performance history, this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase nor decrease the overall rating.<br /><br />Factor 3 - Price: The price quotation will be evaluated against the Independent Government Estimate. Evaluations of quotations will consider the following pricing information: pricing provided for all line items listed in the Schedule of Supplies and Services of this RFQ in the units and format provided; pricing of recommended menu options for breakfast, lunch, snacks and beverages; rates for business services; sleeping room rates; and all cost options for transportation and facility parking rates.&nbsp; A format which may be used for submission of this information is attached to this solicitation.<br /><br />Notice: The Government intends to evaluate quotations and make award without discussions (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the quoter's initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items and 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items, and 52.222-52 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Certain Services-Certification, apply to this acquisition.

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)</p>
<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: <br />Commandant (CG-851) 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606 Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)</p>
<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protests to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
VA-248-11-RP-0104

1) When you state the contractor shall provide all necessary supplies, materials and equipment upon request what are you including in this statement?
This statement is indicating to offerors that any and all supplies, materials, and equipment needed to fulfill the requirements of the contract must be provided by the contractor and that the offeror should not expect to receive any supplies, materials, or equipment from the VA to do so.  This includes plastic disposable articulators or metal hinged articulators to be used and returned.  One possible exception is that that we may provide semi-adjustable ones to be used and returned at our discretion.
2) You state that your intent is to make the award to a small business with such proximity to the VA West Palm Beach facility as to provide a two (2) hour response time when required, does this statement eliminate a lab that is out of this two (2) hour area, ex: Maryland? 
No, this statement is not meant to eliminate any labs based strictly upon geographical location.  The two (2) hour response time is driven by patient needs and the contractor will be required to meet this response time wherever their location may be.  It is also important to clarify that this 2 hour response time is not the standard response time required, but rather a priority response time.  The standard response time is same day pick up when orders are placed by 12 p.m. and next day pick up when orders are placed after 12 p.m.  In the past, 0 to 1 priority orders have been placed per month.
3) You stated "all complete and partial steps shall be completed within Seven (7) working days of pick-up". Due to the many steps necessary to manufacture a quality Partial it is almost impossible to manufacture the partial in 7 working days. We would need 10 working days from the date of arrival at our lab unless this is a bend wire partial. Is this timeframe for a Complete Partial (start to finish in 1 delivery to the lab) or for each of the various steps to be completed?   
The seven (7) working day response time requirement applies to each of the various steps involved in the fabrication of a partial or complete denture.   If multiple steps are combined in a single order, the combined response time shall be determined by mutual agreement.
For example:      Step 1.  Cast RPD  framework - one steep
               	 Step 2.  Bite rims
                	 Step 3.  Setup of teeth for a wax try-in
                	 Step 4.  Process and finish CD or RPD
               	 Step 5.  Transitional RPD ( "flipper) from start to finish.
                	 Step 6.  Custom trays
                	 Step 7.  Re wax try-in


5. It states that the teeth to be used are Bioblend, Portriat IPN, Ivoclar and also it states to use Lucitone for processing. Are these the only teeth to be used and only acrylic to be used or can another brand be used with the same quality? There are many products available that are comparable but at a more reasonable price. Dentsply which is the manufacturer of the Portriat and Bioblend teeth and also the Lucitone acrylic makes other teeth at a more reasonable price, would that be OK? 

We will accept other denture teeth, but not all.  Offerors must specify and provide a list price of alternative teeth proposed.  When specifically requested during the course of the contract, we will only accept Lucitone 199 or characterized Lucitone without substitutions.

6. On crown and bridge PFM, it mainly requests type 3 gold and high noble, gold is at a very high price currently.  Will they be requiring semi-precious and/or non-precious crowns too? 

We will accept Nobel metals also called semi-precious crowns such as Argelite 55.  We will not accept non-precious metals.   


7. Crown and bridge was also asking for Lava crowns, can zirconia be used? This is a comparable brand.
  
No, we have specific requirements for Lava due to existing lab equipment - a chair-side oral scanner and an ST scanner - that interfaces with Lava products.    Procera and zirconia could be considered as other options under certain circumstances at the VA's request but cannot displace the requirement for Lava.


8.  What does it mean "to provide a two hour response time when required to meet patients nutritional needs"?   In other words if they have a need for a repair, reline or a rush case, they will need us to get there and pick it up within two hours?   

See answer to number 2 above.  This means that you or your courier should be available to make pick up within 2 hours for non-routine, priority orders.

<DESC><p>The Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Contracting Squadron, LGCI is seeking sources for C130J AIRCREW AND MAINTENANCE TRAINING in support of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) acquisition program located at Randolph AFB, TX. The REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) is being issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), NOR IS IT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION (RFQ). It is not to be construed as a commitment by the requesting party to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals nor quotes. No award will be made as a result of this RFI. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this RFI. This FedBizOps sources sought notice is strictly for market research. Acknowledgment of receipt of response will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of Government's evaluation of the information received. As a result of this RFI, the Government may issue a RFP; however, should such requirements materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to the RFI (e.g. use of such information as either part of its evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement). All respondents are requested to identify their firm's size and type of business (e.g large business, small business, service disabled, HUB zone, 8(a), etc.) The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 611512, size standard $25.5M.</p>
<p>The source should be capable of:</p>
<p>1. Providing the necessary skills to independently operate and maintain C-130J systems, subsystems, and related support equipment. Training shall be to the level necessary to provide students a thorough understanding of their specialty requirement so that, at the end of their training, they can perform all tasks identified in applicable technical data with minimal supervision. Aircrew training objectives are to train aircrew members for initial qualification transitioning to the C-130J aircraft, provide refresher/upgrade training to experienced aircrews, and to provide initial cadre training. This includes ground academic instruction, flight simulator instruction in Lockheed's LADASSIL Engineering Simulator, or a Level "D" Full Motion Simulator, and teaching students the capabilities to instruct others in ground school and flight simulator training.</p>
<p>2. Provide academic training consisting of lecture/discussion sessions and laboratory exercises. Testing procedures must be in place and documentation will be required to verify the student has gained knowledge and skills taught. If required, Structured On-The-Job Training (SOJT) shall be conducted in the appropriate laboratory, shop or flight line environment and shall include demonstration and application of academic studies. Students and instructors must attest via appropriate documentation that the training task can be accomplished as required.</p>
<p>3. Contractor must have the capability to support multiple training requirements simultaneously.<br /><br />4. The student management and support functions provide for the registration, and the health, morale, welfare and discipline of students. Finally, the program must provide mission support services (lodging, food, postal service, medical, finance, security) and ensure that academic and support facilities are fully equipped and maintained, and that the necessary IT infrastructure is available.</p>
<p>Respondents should be aware that it will be the responsibility for each offeror to submit their capabilities statement, communicating their ability to meet the above mentioned request. The purpose of this notice is to identify capable, interested vendors.</p>

<DESC><p>The synopsis issued October 22, 2010 for procurement of Gaseous Nitrogen (GN2) was identified&nbsp;in FedBizOpps as solicitation number SP0600-10-R-0337 which was later changed to solicitation number SP0600-11-R-0304 is amended. The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) - Energy originally intended to award this requirement on a sole source basis. The procurement environment has now changed, and DLA Energy intends to award on the basis of full and open competition. As such, the Justification and Approval (J&amp;A), which authorized the sole source procurement, no longer applies. Amendment 0004 is forthcoming to extend the date and time for submission of initial offers.</p>

<DESC>*** THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTATIONS OR BIDS ***<BR><BR>Description of Work:  The U.S Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, is seeking industry input for structural systems to develop a training wall feature for the Mile Point Navigation Improvements project.  The purpose of the RFI is to gather industry-wide feedback on alternative materials and/or systems that have been developed and used for coastal and river structures similar to the currently presented stone training wall structure.  <BR><BR>A 4,250 LF training wall is to be located on the south shoreline of the St. John River and west of the confluence of the Intracoastal Waterway (IWW).  The functions of the training wall are to train river currents along the channel; it also serves as containment for approximately 50 acres of high and low marsh to be created behind the structure and serves as an on-going shoreline protection feature to prevent loss of the newly created marsh.  Dredge material placement will be to elevation +2 Feet MLLW on the protected side of the structure.  Proposed training wall systems will need to promote tidal exchanges hydrating and draining the new salt marsh, and should also promote favorable oyster and fish habitat deliveries for a 3.9 Foot mean tide range using openings or windows.  The systems will be required to resist loads for final dredge material placed at elevation +2 Feet MLLW with a base elevation at -3 to -2 Feet MLLW, while resisting overturning and sliding for described conditions.  Approximate dredge slurry maximum elevation may achieve +3 Feet MLLW.  Maximum river current velocity is 5 Feet/Second.  Systems must deliver shoreline protection for wind and wave conditions with a design wave height of 5 Feet.  Top of structure is required at elevation of not less than +7.5 Feet MLLW.  The proposed system should be expected to perform with minimum operational maintenance and repair, and should remain structurally stable for a service period of 75 to 100 years.<BR><BR>The intent of this RFI is to identify for future consideration alternative training wall structures using systems with materials other than natural stone with a 165 PCF weight.  Foundation grading and placement of the foundation-filter stone base will be performed by the Prime contractor such that existing bottom of structures will be established to between -3 and -2 Feet MLLW prior to structure placement.  The stone foundation will extend not less than 10 feet beyond the base of proposed structures on the river side and will require a vertical filter stone to elevation +2 Feet on the marsh side.  Additional detailed descriptions, dimensions and elevations for the training wall are provided on project drawings.  Drawings provided are "Preliminary Draft", and are not intended for solicitation or pricing purposes.  The current stone training wall plan and section is provided for information only.<BR><BR>This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes, it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP), or promise to issue an RFP in the immediate future.  This is a market research to determine whether there is interest and capabilities to design and provide a structurally stable materials and/or system that will perform the described functions identified within the description of work.  Invitations for presentations may be extended to further communicate the capabilities and performance deliveries of proposed systems.  The Government may not make a selection of acceptable systems at this time, as the determination of acceptable systems will continue during development of final project design documents.<BR><BR>Interested parties are requested to submit capability statements, product information, technical approach, installation methods, demonstrated experience where proposed systems have been successfully used before, and any other pertinent information to Beau Corbett of the US Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District.  Mr. Corbett can be reached at (904) 232-1388, and by e-mail at beau.corbett@us.army.mil.  Submission of information via e-mail is the preferred method; however, hard copies can also be mailed to Mr. Corbett's attention at 701 San Marco Blvd, Jacksonville, FL 32207.

<a href="mailto:christopher.m.nuccio@usace.army.mil">USACE District, New Orleans</a>
<DESC>***This synopsis was modified to revise the title of this project***<BR><BR>This solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) resulting in the award of a single firm fixed price (FFP) contract. The Request for Proposal will be issued on or about March 8, 2011 and the Proposal Due Date will be on or about April 7, 2011. The estimated value of this work is $5,000,000.00 to $10,000,000.00. Proposals received in response to this solicitation will be evaluated in accordance with procedures outlined in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for Best Value. NAICS Code: 237990. This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement. The site is located at the LA-18 and UP Railroad crossing, immediately east of the Davis Pond Diversion Canal near Ama, La, and north of the three tracks, the alignment would transition from the Mississippi River Levee to a short reach of levee, to an earthen vehicular ramp, to a reinforced concrete T-wall, to a steel double-swing floodgate, to a reinforced concrete T-wall to a sheet pile I-wall, at Elevations 12.0, 12.0, 15.0, 15.0, 13.0, and 13.5 NAVD88 for a length of approximately 250 feet. Work included within this project consists of the following: Steel Swing Gate at Union Pacific Railroad Crossing, Government-designed temporary falsework, Government-designed temporary retaining structures/temporary flood protection, construction dewatering, concrete reinforced T-Walls, clearing and grubbing, earthern ramp at La Hwy 18, traffic control and coordination, drainage improvements, structural excavation and backfill, turf establishment and maintenance, painting, driving steel sheet piling, driving steel h-piles, driving steel pipe piles, and other incidental work. The railroad gate will require contractors to drive steel H-piling and steel sheet piling, pour base slabs, install false work (temporary bridging consisting of steel pipe piling and structural steel superstructure) for the rail road tracks, construct reinforced concrete floodwall stems, and install steel flood gates in very limited windows of time to facilitate keeping both tracks in service during construction, since this railroad line is reported to be the busiest in the state of Louisiana. The Contractor will be required to provide means to clear railroad ROW quickly should any breakdowns or equipment failures occur (this could mean providing redundant cranes, etc.). Any delays will incur a substantial fine by the railroad company on the construction contractor. As such, a certain level of insurance and bonding capacity will be required as follows: <BR>Contractor, Public and Railroad's Protective Public Liability and Property Damage Liability <BR>Combined Single Limit for Bodily Injury Liability, Property Damage Liability and Physical Damage to Property - $2,000,000 per occurrence. <BR>Aggregate Limit - $6,000,000 for the term of the policy. <BR>For AMTRAK - Aggregate Limit - $12,000,000 for the term of the policy. <BR><BR>Selection will be based on the following criteria, with non-cost factors being more important than price. Factors 1, 2, and 3 are comparatively equal. Factor 4 is less significant than factor 1, 2, and 3. Factor 5 is less significant than factors 1, 2, 3, and 4. (1) Past Performance Risk which includes Safety (2) Technical Approach and Key Personnel (3) Proposed Construction Duration (4) Small Business Participation Plan (5) Price. Factor 5 will not be scored, but will be subjectively evaluated for reasonableness by the board. These evaluation factors are subject to change. Any changes to evaluation factors will be shown in the solicitation. The solicitation will include a detailed list of evaluation factors, including any sub-factors or elements, and will provide instructions for proposal requirements and the basis for award. The Government will not provide written paper copies of the solicitation. Telephone, written, facsimile, or e-mail requests for the solicitation package will not be honored. Potential Offerors MUST register on FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov/ in order to receive notification(s) and/or change(s) to the solicitation. The Interested Vendors List (IVL) will be activated and may be accessed and printed from the FedBizOpps web site. Prospective contractors who would like their company name included on the IVL list may do so on the FedBizOpps website under IVL. Potential contractors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package.

We have heard the final RFP will be released in Feb 2010 (4 weeks following the receipt of industry questions regarding the draft PWS).  The Draft PWS does not provide adequate information to evaluate and prepare for proposal activities.  Evaluation criteria and instructions in draft form will enable us to properly plan for resources needed to support the proposal responses as well as the bid decision. Response:  The RFP release date has not been determined.  Evaluation criteria as well as other information will be provided at a later date along with a schedule.  You should be checking FedBizOps for the latest information. Here are some of the questions we need to answer to help our senior management make a bid decision:  a.	Will award be based on all functional areas (like Alliant) or a subset of the functional areas (like Eagle)?  Response:  The acquisition strategy has not been determined.b.	Is it the VA's desire that this be a small business set-aside contract, that large businesses sub to small businesses. Was the Sources Sought released to gauge small business interest and level of participation? Response:  The acquisition strategy has not been determined.  We are currently in the process of conducting market research which will assist us in determining the acquisition strategy.c.	To limit the number of awards, does the VA want industry to cluster together to form large teams (eg:: Northrop Grumman as prime with Lockheed Martin and GD and lots of small businesses as subs)?  Response:  The number of awards has not yet been determined.  2.	We have heard that responses to sample tasks will be required 15 days before proposal responses.  The purpose of this exercise to assess how well offerors respond to quick-turn TOs.  However, at proposal preparation time, offerors will not have their T4 TO response organizations established, therefore that exercise will not adequately measure our ability to quickly respond (once our T4 Task Order Response organization is established)..  a.	Will sample TOs be required as part of the proposal response? Response: While the acquisition strategy has not been determined, it is not uncommon for agencies to use this approach in the source selection evaluation.b.	How will sample TOs be factored into the evaluation criteria?Response: The acquisition strategy and use of sample tasks not yet been determined.c.	Will sample TO responses be due before proposal responses to the RFP?Response: The acquisition strategy and use of sample tasks not yet been   determined.
