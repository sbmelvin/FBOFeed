<DESC><p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">DLA Aviation, Richmond proposes to issue a Letter Request for Proposal (RFP) to add 35 national stock numbers (NSNs) on the Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (97499) corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9417, a long-term sole source contract which includes multiple NSNs to support various weapon systems. These items are being added to the Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. (BHTI) (97499) Legacy corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9417, in accordance with the initially approved J&amp;A; however, the NSNs identified herein were not included in the list of original items synopsized for this effort. The pricing for the national stock numbers will be for option Years 4 and 5 of the contract. The contract expiration date is 22 February 2017. The contract requires a supply of parts with agreed to terms of FOB origin and inspection/acceptance at origin to DLA Direct stock locations. A total of 35 NSNs are targeted for this contract effort. It is anticipated that the total 35 NSNs will be priced for the award. The proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., CAGE 97499.<br /><br />It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM); therefore, if a non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. These items have been identified as sole source; however, some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. (Note: Other Aviation sites must provide their equivalent surplus clause, as applicable). Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. In addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price. DLA will consider all such responses and may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the government. Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by Wednesday, November 11, 2015. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (<a href="mailto:anne.mastrincola@dla.mil">anne.mastrincola@dla.mil</a>).<br /><br />Additionally, letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This is proposed to be a FAR Part 15 effort. The attached 35 NSNs have been identified for the current procurement. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately. The Letter RFP issue date is Thursday, November 12, 2015. The anticipated closing date is Monday, December 14, 2015.<br /><br />DLA Aviation</p>

<DESC>NSN: 4820-01-123-8906. Item Description: Disk, Valve. Manufacturer's Code and Part Number: CAGE (79318) P/N 723975
<p>Quantity: 72. Unit of Issue: EA. Destination Information: Cherry Point, NC. Delivery Schedule: 300 days. <br /><br />All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 13 NOV 2015. The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.<br /><br />This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved source is: Meggitt (North Hollywood), Inc. (79318).<br /><br />While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. <br /><br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307. <br /><br />One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.<br /><br />Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.<br /><br />Various increments solicited: 25-49, 50-74, and 75-100.</p>

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD), Norfolk, VA, on behalf of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Office of Law Enforcement (OLE), is soliciting a contract for Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and Services. The contract type will be a combination of firm-fixed-price and time-and-materials. The nature of the work to be performed includes, but is not limited to, providing the following: VMS satellite surveillance software and systems integration, VMS communication services, VMS-related materials and services, and VMS satellite surveillance software support and maintenance.
<p>The Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) is a satellite surveillance system which is primarily used to monitor the location and movement of commercial fishing vessels in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and international regional fisheries management organization (RFMO) areas. VMS supports law enforcement initiatives, for regulatory and statutory violation prevention, and for other fishery data-collection purposes. Data from VMS is used as evidence in the prosecution of many environmental laws and regulations including regional fishing quotas, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSFCMA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).</p>
<p>The system employs satellite-based communications from Enhanced Mobile Transceiver Units (EMTU), which are on-board transceiver devices that certain vessels are required to carry. The VMS program monitors over 4,000 vessels 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year. The NMFS OLE employs software to receive, store, and provide to users (via embedded graphical map display, graphical text display or via export to common external data and GIS software formats) the location of those commercial fishing vessels that are required by laws and/or regulations to install and operate an EMTU on board their vessel. The software is used by OLE staff, the United States Coast Guard, State enforcement agencies, and other fisheries-related personnel, totaling over 2,000 users.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement and Free Trade Agreements.</p>
<p>This procurement will be issued on an unrestricted basis. The applicable NAICS code is 517410, Satellite Telecommunications, which has a corresponding size standard of $32,500,000.00. The acquisition will be issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP) in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 15; the RFP will be issued on or about December 4, 2015 with proposals due on or about January 4, 2016. The anticipated award date is March 11, 2016. The Government anticipates awarding one contract from this solicitation that will include one 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods.

<DESC><p>1.0 DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in support of the H-1 Program Office (PMA-276) intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contract for the procurement of Specialized Test Equipment (STE) necessary to perform Depot level repair of the H-1 Multi-Function Display (MFD) components in support of the U.S. Marine Corps H-1 Helicopter. This contract will procure the necessary STE to perform Depot level repair of the H-1 MFD components at Fleet Readiness Center Southwest (FRCSW), Naval Air Station North Island, CA and include the manufacture, delivery, set up, training and maintenance of the STE as determined by the Government prior to delivery and in accordance with Title 10 United States Code (USC) 2464. The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 336411 and the proposed federal supply code (FSC) is 1680.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THIS RFI IS ISSUED SOLELY FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES - IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) OR A PROMISE TO ISSUE AN RFP IN THE FUTURE. THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. FURTHER, THE NAVY IS NOT AT THIS TIME SEEKING PROPOSALS AND WILL NOT ACCEPT UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS. RESPONDENTS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI. ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONDING TO THIS RFI WILL BE SOLELY AT THE EXPENSE OF INTERESTED PARTY. NOT RESPONDING TO THIS RFI DOES NOT PRECLUDE PARTICIPATION IN ANY FUTURE RFP, IF ISSUED. IF A SOLICITATION IS RELEASED, IT WILL BE SYNOPSIZED ON THE FEDERAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES (FBO) WEBSITE. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE POTENTIAL OFFERORS TO MONITOR THIS WEBSITE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THIS REQUIREMENT. INFORMATION PROVIDED HEREIN IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND IN NO WAY BINDS THE GOVERNMENT TO SOLICIT OR AWARD A CONTRACT.</p>
<p><br />2.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The respondent should address its ability to perform the following and include a response to the specific request identified below.</p>
<p>In accordance with Title 10 USC 2464 Core Logistics Capabilities, it has been determined that PMA-276 is required to maintain a core logistics capability for H-1 MFD (Part Numbers: 32210-3 and 32210-7). This capability is to be established not later than four years after achieving Initial Operational Capability, which was September 2015.</p>
<p>The desired end state will be the Government satisfying this core capability via a Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement with Industry that meets the USC Title 10 requirements for Core Depot Support. In addition, the intent is to further investigate the mutual benefits of a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract after depot capability has been established. However, a PBL contract shall not be considered a critical path item for work to flow into Fleet Readiness Center Southwest (FRCSW). When capability is declared by FRCSW, the Depot will be available and used to repair MFD components at the discretion of Naval Supply Systems Command, Weapons Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS).</p>
<p>This effort shall require the Contractor to identify, procure, deliver, install, test and train the artisans in the STE and associated hardware and tooling in order to establish Depot capability for the MFD (Part Numbers: 32210-3 and 32210-7) at FRCSW within a 12 month period of performance. This shall be accomplished in accordance with the specified Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRL).</p>
<p>3.0 REQUESTED INFORMATION</p>
<p>As a result of this RFI, NAVAIR expects to receive a Letter of Intent (LOI) from each interested respondent and a concept summary, which contains a detailed description of the Specialized Test Equipment for Depot Level Repair of the H-1 Multi-Function Display components described in paragraph 2.0 written from a system solution perspective and outlines development concepts that ensures maximum utilization of infrastructure and platform integration elements that already exist. Prospective offerors should explain how they are able to work with the Government and the equipment manufacturer to integrate the proposed Specialized Test Equipment for Depot Level Repair of the H-1 Multi-Function Display components into the H-1 program.</p>
<p>Each concept summary should address how the proposed Specialized Test Equipment and Depot Level Repair of the H-1 Multi-Function Display components meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>1. Description of the proposed Specialized Test Equipment and Depot Level Repair of the H-1 Multi-Function Display described in paragraph 2.0.</p>
<p>In addition, the proposer should have or had a working relationship with the Depot Level System original equipment manufacturer (OEM) (L-3 communications Inc.).</p>
<p>4.0 RESPONSES</p>
<p>Data Markings. In order to complete its review, NAVAIR must be able to share an interested respondent's information both within the Government and with covered Government support contractors as defined in DFARS clause 252.227-7013 Rights in Technical Data - Noncommercial Items (FEB 2014).

<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk, Philadelphia Office hereby gives notice of their intent to award a purchase order to Cydecor, Inc. (Cage Code: 3HBG4) on a single source basis.  This procurement is being conducted utilizing the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) found at FAR part 13.  Furthermore, this procurement is being processed on a single source basis in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b).  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990.  The size standard is $15.0 Million for the applicable NAICS code.

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with Cydecor, Inc. to acquire Program Objective Memorandum (POM) assessment, program management, program analyst, IT, and administrative support services for the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) Undersea Warfare Division (N97).
  The instant requirement is for a short-term interim period of performance (PoP) beginning 1 December 2015 and continuing through 31 May 2016.  Cydecor, Inc. is the only source that can provide the required services for the interim period at the level required by the Government.   Award to a different contractor via competition for the interim period is impractical because of the transition time required at both award and at the end of the contemplated PoP.  The Government intends to award a competitive long-term contract solution for the continuing services to commence at the end of the contemplated PoP.

A firm-fixed-price (FFP) type purchase order is anticipated. 

THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.
  However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which, if received by the response date of this synopsis, will be considered.  A determination by the Government to not compete the proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to continue with the contemplated single source strategy.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in
order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability,
engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s)
require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved
source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that
are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is
essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must
qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved
by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures
must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over
the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government
source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or
the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support
acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously
approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required
for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed
pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must
submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the
NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures
listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair:

offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source
approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source
Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the

solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted
hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to issue sole-source solicitations to Computer Sciences Corporation and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services, LLC&nbsp;to maintain continuity of services at DHS Data Centers 1 and 2 during&nbsp;DHS's transition to the Enterprise Computing Services (ECS) model of data center support. DHS anticipates awarding&nbsp;the resultant contract for support at Data Center 1 to Computer Sciences Corporation&nbsp;in&nbsp;June 2015 with&nbsp;a six month base period of performance and four (4) 12 month option periods beginning on&nbsp;January&nbsp;1, 2016. DHS anticipates awarding the resultant contract for support at Data Center 2 to Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services, LLC in&nbsp;March 2015 with a base year period of performance and four (4) 12 month option periods beginning in June 2015.<br /><br />DHS is continuing its transition from&nbsp;its existing&nbsp;data center support model to the ECS model as described in the Special Notice posted with a&nbsp;tracking number of HSHQDC-15-ECS. DHS awarded the competitive ECS Independent Validation and Verification contract in December 2014 and is actively developing the requirements for the remaining ECS pilot, proof of concept, and prototype&nbsp;acquisitions. The ECS pilot, proof of concept, and prototype&nbsp;acquisitions are anticipated to last from six months to three years each. Based on the Department's&nbsp;projections, transitioning to the new ECS model of support&nbsp;will take up to two years following the conclusion of the pilot, proof of concept, and prototype&nbsp;acquisitions, which necessitates the sole source action described in this notice (please refer to the aforementioned FedBizOpps Special Notice HSHQDC-15-ECS).<br /><br />DHS Data Center 1 is government owned and has been contractor operated by Computer Sciences Corporation since July 2008 under task order HSHQDC-06-D-00021/HSHQDC-08-J-00169. DHS Data Center 2 has been contractor owned and operated by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services, LLC since September 2007 under task order HSHQDC-06-D-00032/HSHQDC-07-J-00515.&nbsp;Both task orders were competitively awarded via DHS's Enterprise Acquisition Gateway for Leading Edge Solutions (EAGLE) multiple award contract. Issuing sole-source solicitations and contracts to Computer Sciences Corporation and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services, LLC to continue services during the ECS transition process is necessary to maintain continuity of mission critical services. A break in or disruption of service due to a rushed transition would have catastrophic impact on the Department's mission and the safety of the American public. The contemplated sole source contracts will provide uninterrupted support during the ECS pilot, proof of concept, and prototype&nbsp;period to allow for transition to&nbsp;the competitively awarded ECS solution.&nbsp;<br /><br />The proposed contract actions&nbsp;are for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete these proposed contracts based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct competitive procurements.<br /><br />A Justification and Approval for Other than Full and Open Competition in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) will be posted within 15 days&nbsp;after the first contract award.

<DESC>The Library of Congress (LOC) is conducting MARKET RESEARCH. This Request for Information (RFI) is being used to determine if sufficient interest and capability exists regarding a potential future solicitation. This notice is provided as information to the market place and is an invitation for respondents to express interest and provide information regarding their relevant capabilities, as well as provide feedback on LOC's requirement. Information submitted in response to this RFI may be used as a basis for a future solicitation and/or as a basis for more in-depth research of our organization's capability.<br /><br />LOC sponsors many events each year. These events include performances, lectures, awards, seminars, and so forth. Currently, physical (i.e. paper) notices of these events are displayed in wall-mounted holders near certain banks of elevators. The notices provide the expected information, e.g. name/type of event, date, time, location, etc. A significant part of a digital signage solution will be to provide the same information electronically, to the public and employees. A feature of a digital signage solution would include providing directions to an event from where the user is reading the notice. While the LOC does not intend to replace all the wall mountings with digital signage, some portion will be replaced or supplemented.<br /><br />LOC is conducting market research around the technical and financial considerations for implementing a digital signage solution at LOC. The overall objectives of digital signage would be to:<br />1. Provide information about public events (dates, times, locations, etc.).<br />2. Provide, via kiosks, a certain amount of interactivity with the public and employees.
<p>The Government is developing a Statement of Work for Digital Signage Systems. Responses should be in a White Paper and contain three elements:<br />1. Your commercial capability that addresses the LOC requirement.<br />2. Your strategy and plan to meet the LOC requirement.<br />3. Pricing Information.<br /><br />Section 1: Digital Signage Solution<br />LOC generally defines this requirement as both hardware and software. <br />Hardware can take the form of monitors (for non-interactive displays), kiosks (for interactive displays), the required infrastructure (e.g. servers, etc.) to support digital signage, and other necessary or recommended items. This requirement would include supply and maintenance of monitors, kiosks, and software throughout LOC. <br />Software would potentially include content management systems, digital signage creation, display and management, and other necessary or recommended items. <br />LOC requires a solution which will also help to identify a wide range of innovative and cost effective solutions to digital signage.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 Requirements<br /></strong>Listed below are the requirements that responses and potential solutions must address.<br /><br />FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS<br />Identifier Functional Requirement Description</p>
<p>Priority<br />FR-1 The system shall have capabilities to control rotation speed High<br />FR-2 The system shall have capabilities to edit and display images, PDF, MSWord, and other word processing and multimedia files High<br />FR-3 The system shall have capabilities to edit and display all information that may be found on a traditional program flyer, including a program title, the speaker and bio, brief description of the program, date, time, location, sponsoring offices, contact information, ADA accommodation information, background design / artwork, event type (open to the public or by invitation only), approval stamps, etc. High<br />FR-4 The system shall have capabilities to build and customize content for display and schedule these displays based on day, time, purposes, etc. High<br />FR-5 The system shall allow template customization functions High<br />FR-6 The system shall have multiple templates to choose from for the types of information outlined in the Business Requirements section of this document High<br />FR-7 The system shall integrate with the Library's approval process workflow (remote submissions by program offices and employee organizations to OC for approval) High<br />FR-8 The system shall have manual and automated standard reporting capabilities (including audit) High<br />FR-9 The system shall have capabilities to remotely control information displayed based on geographic locations High<br />FR-10 The system shall have override capabilities for emergency communications High<br />FR-11 The system shall allow for user posting/integration of currently displayed data to widely-utilized social media streams Low</p>
<p>SECURITY REQUIREMENTS<br />Identifier Security Requirement Description Priority<br />SE-1 Password rules should enforce the use of multifactor password protection High<br />SE-2 The system should implement strong encryption for all data transmission (TCP/IP, HTTPS, other) High<br />SE-3 The system should implement malicious code protection High<br />SE-4 The system should encrypt data at rest High<br />SE-5 The system database(s) should minimize and protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) High<br />SE-6 The system should be compliant with other applicable requirements of the most current LOC ITSDir01 regulation High</p>
<p>ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS<br />Identifier Accessibility Requirement Description Priority<br />AC-1 The system should be ADA, ABA and Section 508 compliant High<br />AC-2 The system should have capabilities to read information out loud using synthetic speech High<br />AC-3 The system should have capabilities to interact with mobile devices and smart phones, such as through the use of beacons, infrared, wireless output or QR codes High<br />AC-4 The system should provide spoken feedback using synthesized speech output to enable persons who are blind or with reading disabilities to access the posted information High<br />AC-5 The system should provide appropriate black on white/white on black contrast at a ratio of no less than 4.5:1 for normal size font, and 3:1 for larger font sizes and images. High<br />AC-6 The system should be mounted in such a way to allow persons sitting down (such as in a wheelchair) to access and read the information. High<br />AC-7 For interactive displays, the system should allow persons who are blind, low vision, or persons with dexterity challenges to fully access and interact with the information. High</p>
<p>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS<br />Identifier General Requirement Description Priority<br />GR-1 Training should be provided to appropriate LOC personnel for the use of all system features and functions High<br />GR-2 The system should have a maintenance plan and schedule, to be agreed to between LOC and the successful vendor High<br />GR-3 The system should support 9 or more screens High<br />GR-4 The system should support 4 or more kiosks that have interactive capabilities and support the Accessibility Requirements. High<br />GR-6 The system should allow multiple format, multiple path inputs to be integrated into a single unified output (e.g. static data and streaming data integrated into a single display with both static data display and electronic ticker tape/streaming media High<br />GR-7 The system should have a (planned) future (scalable, modular) output capability subset, which allows the system to easily adapt to existing technology(ies) for enhanced user interactivity and/or applets (e.g. BYOD blue tooth tablets, cellular smart phones), as well as likely adapts to developing technologies with no more than moderate additional system development requirements High<br />GR-8 System will accept multiple streams of syndicated content as xml or via API from a networked data base to be integrated into a single unified output. High</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Business Objectives<br /></strong>LOC has a "wayfinding" system in place that a digital signage solution could complement. Wayfinding consists of signs mounted on building walls in strategic locations. The signs provide information to visitors and employees regarding such things as:<br />&bull; Ranges of room numbers<br />&bull; Conference and other specialty rooms<br />&bull; Navigation to other buildings</p>
<p>The solution should complement the existing wayfinding signs by providing wayfinding information digitally at selected interactive stations, i.e. kiosks. This may require the ability to perform limited searches at the kiosks. The solution also should have capabilities to display the following types of information:<br />&bull; Public information (e.g. public programs, reading room hours, food service locations and hours, gift shop, tour hours, visitor hours, etc.)<br />&bull; Special events<br />&bull; Emergency information - including closed caption capability<br />&bull; Official announcements<br />1.3 Screens and Kiosks<br />General Requirements GR-3 and GR4 mention 9 or more screens and 4 or more kiosks to be supported. However, these numbers are estimates and may increase or decrease. LOC expects that each respondent will offer the following information:<br />&bull; Recommended screen sizes<br />&bull; Recommended kiosk sizes/footprints<br />&bull; Estimated pricing for 9 screens and 4 kiosks<br />&bull; Price ranges for various sizing configurations<br />&bull; Power and other technical requirements for the screens and kiosks<br />&bull; Expected useful life of proposed equipment<br />&bull; Estimates for Implementation time and resources needed<br />&bull; Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) of implementation on premise ( installation and testing of equipment and software, etc.)<br /><br /><strong>QUESTIONS:<br />QUESTIONS MUST BE SUBMITTED NO LATER THAN 12 NOON EST, Friday, November 6, 2015</strong> in writing to apiper@loc.gov. Answers to questions will post no later than <strong>Friday, November 13, 2015</strong></p>
<p><strong>SUBMISSION OF RESPONSES:<br /></strong>Responses to this RFI should be submitted using MS Word no later than 5:00 PM EST, <strong><em>Thursday, November 19, 2015</em></strong> to: <a href="mailto:apiper@loc.gov">apiper@loc.gov</a>. Responses to all or part of the RFI will be accepted.&nbsp; Proprietary information shall be clearly marked. The Government will NOT be responsible for any proprietary information not clearly marked.

<DESC>Introduction <br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>Background<br />The mission of the Division of AIDS (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is to increase basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), support the development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, and support the development of vaccines and other prevention strategies.  Reliable laboratory data are essential to the clinical evaluation of candidate HIV vaccine platforms and immunogens.  Data from multiple laboratories performing assays in support of single or multiple vaccine candidate trials must be accurate and reproducible.  The purpose of the External Quality Assurance Program Oversight Laboratory (EQAPOL) is to provide confidence that individual laboratories generate reliable data to support vaccine immunogen advancement. EQAPOL supports these efforts by participating in the development and availability of validated assays, providing common and well-characterized reagents and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and providing external quality assurance (EQA) programs to measure and monitor laboratory performance.</p>
<p>The current contract was awarded in 2010 (HHSN272201000045) to Duke University and established proficiency testing programs serving over 60 laboratories in greater than 40 sites worldwide and provided a panel of fully characterized viruses from early acute HIV infections used to develop new assays and validate assay platforms. The contract also established a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) bank and EQA reagent repository of characterized material used to support EQAPOL proficiency testing programs and made available to NIAID supported investigators.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />The proposed contract will support existing activities, develop new assays, and provide assistance in the standardization, validation, and development of new proficiency testing programs. The contract will continue to make materials available to NIAID-sponsored domestic and international investigators.

<p style="text-align: center;">STATEMENT OF WORK FOR SERVICE<br />NOAA THE OFFICE OF MARINE AND AVIATION OPERATIONS (OMAO)<br />HEALTH SERVICES: SERVICE OR SOFTWARE THAT WILL SUPPORT AN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ONLINE&nbsp;PATIENT SCHEDULING SYSTEM AND AN ONLINE MEDICAL RECORDS STORAGE/REPOSITORY SYSTEM</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION<br />NOAA ships and aircraft play a critical role in the collection of oceanographic, atmospheric, hydrographic, and fisheries data. The NOAA fleet is managed and operated by the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO), an office composed of civilians and officers of the NOAA Commissioned Corps.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVE<br />Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),The Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO), has a two part requirement: a central secure electronic location (repository) for storing employee medical records organized in the form of a patient chart is needed to safely and securely facilitate sharing of confidential information within the OMAO Health Services Division and reduce the risk of compromising PII and to expedite fitness for duty processing; a secure electronic scheduling method is needed for appointments to be made for the Inouye Regional Center (IRC) clinic at the Marine Operations Center Pacific Islands (this is the only site that needs scheduling).</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF WORK AND SERVICES<br />The Health Services Division has overall responsibility and authority for the administration and delivery of high quality health care services to NOAA Corps officers, Wage Marine employees, Aircraft Operations personnel and other embarked personnel aboard NOAA vessels and aircraft.</p>
<p>The staff is composed of U.S. Public Health Services officers, located in numerous different geographic areas and aboard ships. Currently these sites are only able to share medical records via e-mail attachment or hard copy. A central secure electronic location (repository) for storing employee medical records organized in the form of a patient chart is needed to reduce the risk of compromising PII and to expedite fitness for duty processing.</p>
<p>The NOAA (IRC) on the island of O'ahu consolidates NOAA programs and operations into a single facility on federally-owned property at Ford Island. A small and intermittently staffed medical clinic has been established there to provide specific occupational medicine services to employees. Because medical provider staffing is intermittent and no administrative assistant support is available, all patient visits are on a walk-in basis only. A secure electronic scheduling method is needed for appointments to be made for this site (this is the only site that needs scheduling).</p>
<p>Common Requirements</p>
<p>&bull; Web based (Secure) <br />&bull; User authentication required (Role-Based) (Would prefer to tie into NOAA's Lightweight Director Protocol (LDAP) service)</p>
<p>Online Patient Scheduling</p>
<p>&bull; Secure web front end for client interaction.<br />&bull; Client access to web system must be authenticated.<br />&bull; Available only to IRC employees.<br />&bull; Display of available times and dates for clients.<br />&bull; Display of patient information, visit reason, and time and date for clinicians.<br />&bull; Display of upcoming Health Education Topics</p>
<p>Online Medical Records Repository</p>
<p>&bull; Secure web base method of storing medical records.<br />&bull; Secure method of accepting laboratory and other testing results.<br />&bull; Accessible from the NOAA fleet.<br />&bull; Optimized network access for satellite based communication systems.<br />&bull; Simple workflow capability.<br />&bull; Records numbering and sorting.<br />&bull; Records searching.<br />&bull; Records storage in a hierarchical structure mirroring the hard copy chart.</p>
<p>Delivery Period: By November 20, 2015</p>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<p>Security Requirements: A software (Secure code tested/allow NOAA to scan code) that can meet and be hosted within all federal NIST and security requirements. Should be able to hosted multiple platforms (FedRAMP Cloud Software as a Service (SaaS), Platforms as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)) services currently under contract by the DOC/NOAA with FedRAMP approved Cloud Service Providers (CSP). If this solution is hosted by the vendor in a Cloud environment they must operate in a FedRAMP approved CSP environment. If the vendor plan is to host services in a physical data center location, they must provide a certain level of assurance to the customer that certain security controls/requirements are in place.</p>
<p>All IT health standards and HIPAA regulations apply to protect the individuals' electronic personal health information that is created, received, used, or maintained by a covered entity. The Security Rule also applies which requires appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of electronic protected health information (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and C of Part 164).</p>

<CONTACT>Sally A. Aultman, Phone 2024024282, Email sally.a.aultman@hud.gov
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) DU100I-16-RFISAMS <br />REQUESTING SOURCES SOUGHT AND CAPABILITY STATEMENTS
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY. This is not a request for offers, quotes or proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a market research tool only to determine the capability of potential sources.<br />The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is contemplating establishing a contract under NAICS Code 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services and the Small Business Standard is $27.5 million, PSC Code 7030 Information Technology Software for Single Family Acquired Asset Management System (SAMS/A80S) to support Operations &amp; Maintenance and possible Development, Modernization and Enhancement on an IBM based environment and is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) in order to solicit responses from capable sources and capability statements to ensure sufficient competition exists to meet the government's requirements. This is a firm fixed price contract.<br /><br />Teaming arrangements and joint ventures will be considered for any subsequent procurement based on the Government's market research, provided that (state any conditions under which teaming arrangements and joint ventures will be considered (e.g. The prime contract is awarded to an applicable small business and that small businesses provide fifty percent or more of the support)).<br />BACKGROUND<br />This effort is to identify companies that can best support the Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) of the Single Family Acquired Asset Management System (SAMS/A80S). A80S is a large scale legacy base system running on an IBM mainframe (i.e., 2098-T02). The system was created by in 1994-1995 using a Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tool known as "INCASE". Since that software is still used to maintain and support SAMS/A80S, the fundamental requirement of this effort is the ability to obtain and effectively utilize that proprietary software.</p>
<p>GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK<br />SAMS is a mission critical system that is one of the Department's core financial systems. SAMS tracks and reports on HUD homes for sale, and processes all financial transactions related to their repair, lease, listing, and sale, including payments for contractor services, taxes and Homeowner Association and condominium fees. SAMS tracks, reports and accounts for homes in HUD's custody. SAMS is integral to managing the portfolio of HUD homes, acquired at the rate of 50,000 to 100,000 properties per year; accounting for obligations, disbursements and collections resulting from their maintenance and sale; monitoring contractor performance; limiting mission programs to eligible participants; and providing management information needed for program oversight and compliance with Congressional, auditor and other requests.</p>
<p>The hardware and software for SAMS runs in a DB2 environment on HUD's production International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) mainframe. Physical access is secured at the computer operations center. In addition to DB2 access controls, the system is secured through HUD's standard third-party security package for IBM-based systems, CA TOPSECRET. SAMS' on-line and batch code is created by INCASE which is owned, maintained and modified by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Services, LLC. INCASE produces COBOL programs to support all functions of SAMS'. Mainframe reports are written in NOMAD or COBOL. SAMS interfaces with Treasury and Lockbox banks, as well as other Single Family Mortgage Insurance systems (e.g. Insurance-in-Force, Claims and Notes). System extracts are provided to contractors via the Asset Disposition and Management System (ADAMS/P260) to conduct management and marketing (M&amp;M) on HUD homes (through them, to the real estate industry's Multiple Listing Services). SAMS also uses Microsoft's SharePoint for the distribution of reports.</p>
<p>Receives Data From Sends Data To<br />HUD Geocoding Service Center/A15 HUD Geocoding Service Center/A15<br />HUD Single Family Insurance System (SFIS)/A43 HUD Single Family Insurance System (SFIS)/A43<br />HUD Single Family Claims Subsystem/A43C HUD Single Family Claims Subsystem/A43C<br />Data Warehouse/D64A<br /><br />Currently, SAMS interfaces with the following Federal systems:<br /><br />a. Provide O&amp;M Support examples data fixes, adhoc queries, review and fixing job failures<br />b. Provide software modification services for SAMS <br />c. Provide Development Modernization and Enhancement Support</p>
<p>Knowledge of using case tool INCASE. The system is maintained in a case tool environment using INCASE.</p>
<p>Strong working knowledge of the following:<br />1. DB2 in an IBM mainframe environment.<br />2. MVS/zOS<br />3. COBOL<br />4. NOMAD<br />4. SAS<br />5 Project Management skills<br />4. Accounting practices. <br />CONTEMPLATED REPORT REQUIREMENTS<br />Current reports are created by COBOL programs, NOMAD programs, Statistical Analysis System/SAS program and can database queries. There are currently 450 reports in the A80S/SAMS. Reports created are at the summary level, the detail level and status level. These reports are used at all levels from operational teams to high level executive review.</p>
<p>CONTEMPLATED PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br />The work is done offsite at the contractor work site.<br />RESPONSE REQUESTED<br />Small Businesses are encouraged to respond.<br />This synopsis is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and capability of potential sources prior to determining the method of acquisition and whether the government will proceed with this acquisition. The Government will not pay for any information solicited. If a contract is ultimately pursued, responses to this synopsis will be used to aid in determining whether the acquisition is set-aside for small business or in establishing small business subcontracting goals.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Honolulu District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) on the following large scale construction project (exceeding $25 million) within the State of Hawaii:
<p>FY16 PN 80412 Health Clinic Parking Structure, Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii</p>
<p>Project Description: Construct a new 5-story, 429-stall parking structure with supporting utilities, and site improvements in a developed area to serve the needs of the surrounding Schofield Barracks Medical Center. The parking structure will be constructed in a congested area, near or adjacent to existing dental and medical clinics that must remain operational. Th parking structure is presently occupied by on-grade parking lots. The Contractors Operations and Staging Area (COSA) will be located approximately 1.5 miles from the project site. Workspace adjacent to the structure footprint is limited to loading and offloading only. An approximately 150 stall temporary parking area for staff and patients will be provided adjacent to the COSA. During the period of construction the contractor will provide a shuttle bus service between the temporary parking area and existing clinic. The parking structure will consist of four levels of elevated parking and one below grade level of parking. Excavation to construct below-grade parking level will require protection of nearby existing utilities to remain and a dental clinic building. The below grade parking will have foundation walls on two sides and air vent shafts on two sides. The below grade framing will be cast-in-place concrete foundation walls. The basement floor slab will be a concrete slab-on-grade. The above grade framing and interior basement framing will consist of precast concrete framing. Exterior walls will be precast concrete wall panels. The parking levels will consist of precast concrete double tees supported on the precast concrete walls at the exterior and along the ramps, precast concrete beams and columns. The project will also include traffic signals, roadway improvements, roadway resurfacing, landscaping, an elevator, and a parking guidance system. Access for individuals with disabilities must be provided, and the parking structure must be Antiterrorism Force Protection (ATFP) compliant. The estimated performance of period is 36 months. Magnitude is $25M - $100M.</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>FAR 22.503 Policy provides that:</p>
<p>(a) PLAs are a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of PLAs in connection with large-scale construction projects.</p>
<p>(b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of PLAs will--</p>
<p>(1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and</p>
<p>(2) Be consistent with law. (Refer also to FAR 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for PLA and FAR 52.222-34 PLA).<br />(c) Agencies may also consider the following factors in deciding whether the use of a PLA is appropriate for the construction project:<br />(1) The project will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple crafts or trades.<br />(2) There is a shortage of skilled labor in the region in which the construction project will be sited.<br />(3) Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br />(4) PLAs have been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of the project.<br />(5) A PLA will promote the agency's long term program interests, such as facilitating the training of a skilled workforce to meet the agency's future construction needs.<br />(6) Any other factors that the agency decides are appropriate.<br />In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs for this requirement. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions and tables:</p>
<p>1. Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so, please provide supporting documentation?</p>
<p>2. Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? If so please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>3. Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.</p>
<p>4. Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>5. Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.</p>
<p>6. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>7. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA on the referenced project.</p>
<p>Please include information on projects completed in the last 2-5 years:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; Project Name / Location Detailed Project Description <br />b.&nbsp; Initial Cost Est. / Actual final cost <br />c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the project completed on-time? <br />d.&nbsp; Number of craft trades present on the project <br />e.&nbsp; PLA (Y/N) <br />f.&nbsp;&nbsp; Were there any challenges experienced during project? (delays, investigations, health and safety issues, labor shortages, management / organizational issues, etc)<br /><br />Please provide your project specific comments via e-mail to Dayna Matsumura, at dayna.n.matsumura@usace.army.mil and Kent Tamai, at kent.a.tamai@usace.army.mil, no later than November 13, 2015 at 2:00 p.m., Hawaii Standard Time.</p>
<p>This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.</p>

At no time shall this failure to complete the transport as scheduled result in reimbursement for a "Dry Run." Repeated failures of this nature may result in termination of the contract for cause.
 
27.2	If at any time a transport is ordered and the contractor meets response times, completes a transport, but for reasons beyond the control of the contractor, fails to do so in time for the patient to meet the scheduled appointment time, that transport will be invoiced and paid at one-half (1/2) the contracted rate (base rate, mileage, etc.).

<DESC>This synopsis publication satisfies the requirement at FAR Part 5.2 and constitutes the Government's Notice of Intent to award a sole source modification to Scientific Research Corporation (SRC) for the Threat Signal Simulator Program (TSSP) support (W900KK-12-D-0001). The TSSP contract was awarded on 28 June 2012, as a Sole Source in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), per FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)-Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The contract was awarded to SRC for a period of a one-year base and 4 options years for a total of 5 years. The modification will be accomplished using the same authority as the original award, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)-Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br />Army Contracting Command - Orlando (ACC - ORL), in coordination with the requiring activity, Program Executive Office Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO-STRI) Program Manager Instrumentation, Targets &amp; Threat Simulators (PM-ITTS) Threat Systems Management Office (TSMO), intends to modify contract W900KK-12-D-0001 with SRC on a sole source basis in support of the TSSP program. The modification is expected to increase the contract value approximately $13,490,000, from $74,192,846 to $87,682,846 due to the increasing Cyber Threat &amp; Event Support. The period of performance (POP) of the current contract is 31 March 2017 and there is no anticipated need for an extension at this time. <br />The TSSP mission under TSMO is to develop and build operationally relevant threat signal simulators, including unique injection jamming devices, cyber training and infrastructure and foreign commercial cell phone systems in the Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) Electronic Warfare (EW) environment. Also included is the required operating software needed for the development and fielding of the TSSP systems and other threat efforts directly related to or that incorporate or support Electronic Attack (EA), Electronic Surveillance (ES) and Electronic Protection (EP) in the EW environment. Capabilities developed under this contract will integrate with other threat systems including threat mission command systems such as the Integrated Threat Force (ITF) and their respective live and simulation environments depicting LVC threat assets. The capability delivered will integrate with the ITF by providing an opposing ("Red") Commander at a test/training event with the mission command structure to enable a real-time response in a "free play" environment; a capability far beyond merely following a scripted exercise. The contract will maintain sufficient continuity of effort in response to ongoing developmental efforts to establish Army requirements, as specified by Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) Threat Capabilities Requirements Documents (TCRD), and will support the continuation of ongoing TSSP development, testing, integration, installation and training plus support for field exercises.The required work to be performed is within scope of the contract.<br />Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition of this action would not result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government for the start-up, hiring, training, execution and administration of the above support services over the estimated period of performance associated with the remaining POP for contract W900KK-12-D-0001. <br />Interested and responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, outlining pricing information, information showing how the government can recover the anticipated substantial duplication of costs through a competitive action, and demonstrating the ability to meet the Government's needs. The government will not be responsible for any costs incurred in preparation of any capabilities statements or documents prepared for this notice. Responses must be received no later than the 15th day after this notice is posted (12 November 2015). The above described capability statements, quotes, or proposals must be submitted via email to Ms. Ashley Carter, ACC Orlando, Contract Specialist, at ashley.n.carter55.civ@mail.mil AND to Ms. Jean Borowski, ACC Orlando, Contracting Officer, at jean.m.borowski.civ@mail.mil.
<p>This synopsis is not considered a request for bid, quote, or proposal. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests for technical information will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of capability statements, quotes, or proposals received in response to this notice, but responses, if any, will be used to determine if a competitive action would eliminate any substantial duplication of costs.</p>

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO EXTEND FACILITY SITE SERVICES AT THE PORTSMOUTH SITE
<SOLNBR>DE-CI0000004_MOD112
<CONTACT>Bryan L. Davis, Email bryan.davis@lex.doe.gov
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT<br />The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Portsmouth/Portsmouth Project Office (PPPO), intends to issue a noncompetitive modification to Contract Number DE-CI0000004 to extend the period of performance for up to six (6) months from January 26th, 2016 to July 25th 2016 with Wastren-Energx Mission Support, LLC (WEMS), in support of infrastructure support services to include (but not limited to): Contract transition activities, Grounds Maintenance, Snow Removal and Pest Control, Roadway/Parking Lot Maintenance, Janitorial services, Computer and Telecommunication Services to include Information Technology (IT) and Cyber Security, Security, Training services, Environmental, Safety, Health and Quality Program, Facility Maintenance, Mail Services, Records Management and Document Control, Fleet Management, Real and Personal Property Management, Medical Service, Shipping and Receiving Services, Waste Management and Pollution Prevention, Project Management and Project Support Controls, Non-nuclear Preventive and Corrective Maintenance Activities in the Assigned Non-nuclear and Nuclear facilities, and other support activities necessary for the success of the D&amp;D mission including the interface with other entities on site.<br /><br />In accordance with Competition in Contracting Act, 41 U.S.C. &sect;3304 (a)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), other than full and open competition is authorized when there is only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy agency requirements. <br /><br />An attempt to contract with another entity to perform infrastructure support services, on a temporary, short term basis while the on-going procurement is being completed is impracticable and would likely adversely affect the Department of Energy's mission.&nbsp; Transitioning to a new contractor for the six (6) month period of performance needed to complete the on-going procurement and transition to the new contractor would be unnecessarily disruptive because a second transition would be required upon the award of the new competitive contract.&nbsp; During the transition period between contracts, critical operational and security operations is required in developing and implementing security procedures, plans, and directives in support of mission requirements are conducted.&nbsp; Two transitions within a 90 to 180 day period could have a negative effect on ongoing activities and the potential changes to contractor management and staff, which could result in the loss of expertise and historical/institutional knowledge and result in significant potential for poor decision-making, adverse security impacts, and could potentially jeopardize national security.&nbsp; <br /><br />Awarding the proposed contract to another source would result in unacceptable delays and substantial additional costs to the Government, as the new source would require time to implement the immediate requirements. An interruption to the services currently being provided by WEMS would compromise the mission of the DOE.&nbsp; Based on the time constraint and expected increase in cost inherent in awarding to another contractor, it is not in the best interest of the Government to award to any vendor other than WEMS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been determined to be in the best interest of the government to extend the current contract beyond the present period of performance.&nbsp;<br /><br /> <br />SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS: All responsible sources may identify their interest by submitting a capability statement in response to this requirement, which shall be considered by the agency. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes or proposals. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The Government does not intend to pay for information provided in response to this publication. Written responses to this notice must be submitted by November 17th, 2015 and shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. All interested parties shall submit clear and convincing documentation demonstrating their capabilities to satisfy the requirements listed above to Bryan Davis and Marcella Wolfe by email at bryan.davis@lex.doe.gov and marcella.wolfe@lex.doe.gov.<br />The capability documentation should include general information and technical background describing in detail the prospective contractor's capabilities and experience that will demonstrate the ability to support these immediate requirements. <br />THIS NOTICE OF INTENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A REQUEST FOR A FORMAL PROPOSAL OR A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a microphone that detects infrasound, i.e., acoustic waves ranging from 20 Hz frequencies down to dc. Infrasound is emitted in a number of hazardous atmospheric phenomena, including aircraft wake vortices, clear air turbulence, and tornadoes. It is also emitted by seismic events, such as underground nuclear tests, digging of tunnels, etc. Infrasound propagates hundreds of miles and can penetrate walls, mountains and other obstacles without loss. The NASA infrasound sensor filters out wind noise that can interfere with detection, while using less power and much less space than currently available solutions. As a result, the NASA infrasound sensor can detect tornadoes and clear air turbulence hundreds of miles away; an array of 30 could cover the entire continental US. Aircraft wake vortices can be detected in real time by microphone arrays placed along an airport runway.  NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company. For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at <A HREF="http://technology.nasa.gov/">http://technology.nasa.gov/ </A>  . These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development OSACB for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a new Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) method for identifying and characterizing hidden damage in composite materials. The new technique requires only single sided access to the test specimen and uses trapped energy analysis to detect and characterize damage that was previously obscured. Current methods, usually ultrasound or laser ultrasound, cannot characterize imperfections below or hidden by near surface damage. The new method uses 3D custom ultrasonic simulation tools to study ultrasonic guided wave behavior and energy trapping due to multilayer delamination damage. Understanding the extent of composite damage is essential for repair and replacement decisions for aerospace composites. Better understanding of composite damage could eliminate unnecessary repairs and aid in preventing catastrophic in-service failure.  NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed Scintillating Quantum Dots (StQDs) for Imaging X-rays (SQDIX) technology that enables the creation of x-ray detectors that are more sensitive than current x-ray detectors. In addition to superior sensitivity, SQDIX also offers the promise of reducing the cost of x-ray detectors by at least by a factor of 10. The SQDIX system is an enabling technology that can have game-changing impacts across many fields including DoE, DoD, NASA, medical imaging fields, aircraft inspection and many other fields. StQDs are sensitive to x-ray radiation and emit visible photons that are tunable in wavelength. Development of this technology will greatly impact NASA's ability to use X-Rays as an inspection method. This directly addresses the Aviation Safety challenge in the 2010 National Aeronautics R&D Plan to monitor and assess the health of aircraft more efficiently and effectively as well as all NASA spaceflights beyond earths magnetic field. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company.

After being ranked according to price in ascending order, the proposal will be provided to the technical team for technical evaluation.

This process will continue until the Government has determined a proposal to be technically acceptable.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

<p>"System for Award Management (SAM) database" means the primary Government repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>RAPIDGate&reg; is being implemented for access to DoD facilities in CONUS, HI, Guam and Puerto Rico. Vendor is responsible to acquire RAPIDGate&reg; status and destination base individual access badge(s) activation prior to performance start date. Delays that may result from inadequate planning are contractor responsibility. Vendor instructions and program information is available at http://www.RAPIDGate.com or tel. 877.727.4342. RAPIDGate&reg; access requires (in succession) (1) Individual Base Commander approval for vendor to access base, (2) Successful vendor RAPIDGate&reg; company annual enrollment, (3) Company employee individual enrollment and possession of RAPIDGate&reg; identification badge for single base or multiple base (enterprise) access.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB or Agency) is an independent Federal Agency in the Executive branch created by the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA), Pub. L. No. 99-335, 100 Stat. 514 (codified as amended largely at 5 U.S.C. &sect; 8351 and &sect;&sect; 8401-79) to administer the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). The TSP is a daily-valued, participant-directed retirement savings and investment plan for Federal civilian employees and members of the uniformed services. It offers its participants the same type of saving and tax benefits that many private corporations offer their employees under 401(k) plans. The TSP is the largest defined contribution plan in the world covering millions of participants and managing multi-billion dollar assets. The Agency has a permanent staff headquartered in Washington, D.C., supplemented by contract personnel, which assists the Executive Director in fulfilling the Agency's mission to act solely in the interests of the Thrift Savings Plan participants and beneficiaries and to carry out the policies set by the Board members for investment, administration, and management of the TSP. The FRTIB operates on non-appropriated funds. As a non-appropriated fund agency, it is not bound by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
<p>The Human Resources Division (HRD), Office of Resource Management is responsible for providing cost-effective and coordinated strategies for the delivery of training and employee development programs that support the mission and goals of the agency. The agency has an Executive Coaching Program which attends to the developmental needs of executives, managers and supervisors. An Executive coaching program professionally complements and enhances the Executive Core Qualifications in leading change, leading people, being results driven, business acumen, building coalitions, and the fundamental competencies.</p>
<p>To support agency goals and strategic planning for human capital solutions, succession planning, competency identification and development, the agency is seeking the services of high level professional coaches.<br /><br />The Agency intends to award a multiple award Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for these services. Individual Call Orders will be placed for each coaching engagement.</p>

<p>8. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Based in Monrovia, Liberia</p>
<p>9. JOB DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Specialist<br />10. BASIC FUNCTION OF POSITION</p>
<p>Although significant challenges remain, Liberia's health has made substantial progress since the civil war ended in 2003. Liberia's civil wars, which spanned 1989 to 2003, decimated basic infrastructure, including water and sanitation, electricity, roads, education, and health services - factors that contributed to the spread of disease and premature mortality. More than a decade following the end of the conflict, Liberia still remains among the poorest countries in the world, facing significant public health challenges as well as weak systems for delivering basic health services. Supply chain systems remain weak leading to recurrent stock-outs of basic supplies and medications, availability of skilled health workers is still low by regional standards, management capacity at all levels remains thin, and service provision in many areas is dependent on support from donors and NGO partners. Health systems weaknesses were among the factors that enabled the 2014 Ebola outbreak to quickly escalate into a full-scale national emergency, and threatening to further reverse years of progress made in improving the health status of Liberians. <br /><br />The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) Specialist will join the Mission Health Team which presently consists of 14 positions including three US Direct Hires (USDHs), and a combination of US and Third Country National (TCN) Personal Services Contractors (US/TCN PSCs), and locally engaged Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs). The team is organized into two sub-teams, each headed by a USDH Foreign Service Officer: the Service Delivery Sub-team, and the Health Systems Strengthening Sub-team. The Health Systems Strengthening Sub-team leads management of the Mission's flagship wrap-around technical assistance activity, Collaborative Support for Health Systems Strengthening (CSH), and coordinates the health portfolio's WASH activities which cut across both the Service Delivery and the Health Systems Strengthening Sub-teams. The Service Delivery Sub-team leads management of a Government-to-Government (G2G) Fixed Amount Reimbursement Agreement (FARA) the Ministry of Health (MOH), as well as a diverse portfolio of technical assistance and support in cross-cutting areas of primary health care service delivery including maternal/reproductive and child health. In addition, the health portfolio has a strong and extensive President's Malaria Intiative (PMI) that, coupled with the Global Fund investment, covers the entire country.</p>
<p>The Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (M&amp;E) position will join the Health Office at USAID/Liberia to oversee and coordinate the monitoring and evaluation of all health program activities in Malaria, Maternal &amp; Child Health (MCH), Family Planning &amp; Reproductive Health, HIV/AIDS, Ebola, and health systems strengthening. The Office of Health's monitoring and evaluation functions include, but are not limited to: project performance monitoring (including participation on an advisory level in the Ministry of Health's stewardship and M&amp;E oversight); program level data gathering/validation; trend monitoring and reporting; implementation of public health evaluations and special studies; and strengthening of health management information systems, national surveillance systems and population based surveys. The specialist will be an integral member of the Health team providing leadership and technical guidance to effectively monitor and evaluate the full range of program progress and results.</p>
<p>The M&amp;E Specialist will also serve as the Program Office liaison on behalf of the Health Team around monitoring, evaluation, and learning. The Specialist will lead planning, logistics and implementation of key programmatic activities, such as the annual performance plan and report, operational plan, annual and semi-annual reporting (including USAID's PPR, ad-hoc reporting required for special initiatives, etc.), monthly Congressional mandated reporting for Ebola activities, partners' M&amp;E plans, work-plan reviews, and health portfolio review. The M&amp;E Specialist will also interact closely with the broader health team; the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) members, and the interagency Ebola Team and will collaborate on programmatic responses from headquarters. The Specialist will interact with the Government of Liberia (GOL), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the private sector, USAID implementing partners, and any other key stakeholders involved in health programming. The Specialist will also lead the development, streamlining and implementation of strategic processes, tools and systems across the board for the Health Office.</p>
<p>The Specialist is expected to complete assigned duties with little direct supervision and will work extensively through diverse teams.

The offeror is requested to provide this information in the following format for each contract:</p>
<p>a. Name of contracting agency/ customer<br />b. Agency/customer point of contact (include phone number and email address)<br />c. Contract number<br />d. Contract award date<br />e. Contract completion date<br />f. Contract value (original and final)</p>
<p>If subcontracting arrangement is proposed, the above data must also be provided for each first tier subcontractor. If a joint effort or teaming arrangement is proposed, highlight previous experience with the proposed team or subcontractor.</p>
<p>VOLUME II: PRICE</p>
<p>Provide one (1) fully executed and signed copies of the solicitation. Ensure all sections are complete.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.<br />***Past performance is significantly more important than price.***</p>
<p><br />The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Past Performance</p>
<p>(a) The Government will evaluate the offerors past performance information for quality and confidence. The offeror shall identify at least two relevant (construction, overhaul, repair and alteration of ships) and current federal, state or local government or private contracts performed during the last three (3) years.</p>
<p>If subcontracting arrangement is proposed, the above data must also be provided for each first tier subcontractor. If a joint effort or teaming arrangement is proposed, highlight previous experience with the proposed team or subcontractor.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will take into account the guidelines outlined at FAR 15.305(a) (2). The quality of past performance and relevance of experience to the Coast Guard will be evaluated. The ability to manage and maintain a qualified workforce will be considered. Customer satisfaction will be an integral consideration. In evaluating past performance the Government will consider contracts performed during the last 3 years. Emphasis will be placed upon the contractor's administration of the contractual responsibilities. For example:</p>
<p>(1) Adequacy of contract start up. <br />(2) Performance in accordance with proposed method of performance. <br />(3) Sufficiency of proposed personnel to perform contract. <br />(4) Filling of key positions with qualified individuals. <br />(5) Quality performance of work. <br />(6) Response to emergency situations. <br />(7) Schedule adherence (including administrative aspects of performance.) <br />(8) Responsiveness to Government requirements. <br />(9) Performance in accordance with contract requirements. <br />(10) Customer satisfaction. <br />(11) Complete submittals. <br />(12) Timely delivery of paperwork. <br />(13) Timely and accurate invoice submittals <br />(14) Quality of drawings. <br />(15) Knowledge of Customer Requirements and Expectations. <br />(16) Management and cost control of subcontracts</p>
<p>Following the quality evaluation, the Government will assign an overall confidence rating to each past performance reference, considering both the relevance and quality of the provided reference. The Government will then assign a composite past performance confidence rating for the vendor's overall past performance, considering the confidence ratings assigned to each individual reference. The confidence evaluation will be in accordance with the following table</p>
<p>Past Performance Quality Rating:<br />Rating Definition<br />Exceptional Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds many to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being evaluated was accomplished with few minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were highly effective.<br />Very Good Performance meets contractual requirements and exceeds some to the Government's benefit. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being evaluated was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.<br />Satisfactory Performance meets contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appear or were satisfactory.</p>
<p>Marginal Performance does not meet some contractual requirements. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element being evaluated reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions. The contractor's proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented.<br />Unsatisfactory Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner. The contractual performance of the element or sub-element contains a serious problem(s) for which the contractor's corrective actions appear or were ineffective.<br />Neutral The offeror has no past performance history OR the Contracting Officer has determined that the past performance information provided is not directly related or similar to the requirements in the RFP</p>
<p>(b) The Government may review Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) ratings <br />on relevant contracts and may also consider Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) <br />ratings, regulatory agency databases, past performance questionnaires, information submitted by each <br />Offeror with its quote, and other existing past performance information contained in either local or <br />other supervisor files, or from other Government sources or non-Government sources. Offerors are <br />advised that in evaluating an Offeror's past performance, the Government may, in its sole discretion, <br />consider information from sources outside the Offeror's quote. For example, the Government may <br />consider information based on its own experience with the Offeror and/or may contact the parties for <br />whom the Offeror performed contracts and consider their response when evaluating the Offeror's <br />quote. General trends in a contractor's performance will also be considered. In the case of an Offeror <br />without a record of relevant past performance, or for whom information on past performance is not <br />available, they will not receive a favorable or unfavorable rating.</p>
<p>The assessment of the Offeror's Past Performance is one of the factors used for evaluating the <br />Offeror's ability to successfully perform the requirements of this solicitation as well as to determine <br />the Offeror's performance risk for the subject solicitation. Such consideration is separate and distinct <br />from the Contracting Officer's responsibility determination under FAR 9. The Government reserves <br />the right to contact references provided by the Offeror, and otherwise verify statements and <br />representations made in the Offeror's quote, but reserves the right not to contact.</p>
<p>2. Price</p>
<p>The total price of the offeror will be determined by totaling the proposed prices of all the Definite Items and the Composite Labor Hour extended total, plus lay days and foreseeable costs. Offeror's price shall represent the best price in response to the request for quotes. The price shall be evaluated to determine fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>Price quote will be reviewed for completeness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC>Raptor Helmet Mounted Display &amp; Cueing System&nbsp;(RHMDCS) Initial Request for Information (RFI)<br /><br />Solicitation Number: FA8611-WPAFB-HMD, 5 June 2015
<p>I. Request for Information (RFI) for Planning Purposes</p>
<p>a) This is an RFI in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3 - Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997). Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Only United States companies will be considered for contract award.</p>
<p>b) The Government is conducting market research to identify, as potential sources, companies that may possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to competently and competitively respond to requirements to provide a Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) for the F-22 Raptor weapon system.</p>
<p>c) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited. Companies responding to this RFI are advised that participation does not ensure involvement in future solicitations or contract awards. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparation or participation of this RFI. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>d) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this RFI, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>e) Background: As weapon systems have become increasingly complex and aircrews are exposed to extensive amounts of battlespace information, it has become clear that an HMD capability for the warfighter is necessary. Industry has recently made major advances in HMD capabilities for aircrew personnel. The purpose of this RFI is to determine existing and emerging Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) or Government-off-the-Shelf (GOTS) technology solutions that can be used to enhance aircrew warfighting operational capabilities with respect to HMD capabilities, as well as acquire industry feedback relating to the following questions:</p>
<p>i. Draft Statement of Objective (SOO) and System Requirements Document (SRD) are attached to this notice. Please review and provide any comments.</p>
<p>ii. If a demonstration with your system fully integrated into the F-22 Air Combat Simulator (ACS) were required, what information would your company need from the Government? What time and resources would be required for this demonstration?</p>
<p>iii. If a demonstration without full integration into the ACS were required, what information would your company need from the Government? What time and resources would be required for this demonstration?</p>
<p>iv. If a demonstration in the F-22 aircraft were required, what information would your company need from the Government? What time and resources would be required for this demonstration?</p>
<p>v. Would your company be willing to provide helmets for demonstration and/or flight test without cost to the Government?</p>
<p>vi. Please provide any other important factors to consider in regards to a demonstration in either the simulator or the aircraft.</p>
<p>vii. Please provide an estimate of your company's manufacturing capability and how much capacity you expect to have available to meet the required engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) and retrofit schedules. The Government anticipates the following equipment requirements:</p>
<p>1. Group A = 190 (On aircraft equipment and software)<br />2. Group B = 190 (Interface equipment between aircraft and helmet components)<br />3. Group C = 342 (Helmet components)</p>
<p>In addition, 7 sets would be required for EMD, to be delivered in 2017. Full rate production (FRP) would require deliveries in 2020-2022.</p>
<p>viii. Based on the information that has been released to industry thus far, what concerns does your company have regarding this potential competition?</p>
<p><br />II. Program Requirements</p>
<p>Minimum requirements for a HMD system are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Color display<br />&bull; Capable of displaying a variety of sensor inputs and customized symbology<br />&bull; Capable of cueing sensors and weapons<br />&bull; Supports display and cueing in all day and night operations<br />&bull; Provides symbology and imagery integration with enhanced night vision systems<br />&bull; Compatible with safe operation of the current USAF escape systems and cockpit accommodations, ex. meets military standard human factors related requirements and provides appropriate disconnects for emergency/normal egress<br />&bull; System can be sustained for projected service life of aircraft <br />&bull; Integrated camera which records external field of view and overlaid HMD imagery <br />&bull; HMD symbology can be easily modified for little or no cost outside of the aircraft Operational Flight Program (OFP)<br />&bull; Must not hinder pilot performance during all phases and durations of flights</p>
<p>Additional information is given in the draft SRD&nbsp;that is included with this RFI.</p>
<p>It is critical that respondents include the degree to which they require access to F-22 air vehicle weapons system data rights and the degree to which they have, or are able to obtain air vehicle data rights from Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company.</p>
<p><br />III. RFI Response.</p>
<p>Part A: Business Information. In response to this RFI, please provide the following business information for your company and for any teaming or joint venture partners:</p>
<p>&bull; Company Name: <br />&bull; Address: <br />&bull; Point of Contact: <br />&bull; CAGE Code: <br />&bull; Phone Number: <br />&bull; E-mail Address: <br />&bull; Web Page URL: <br />&bull; North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code: 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services. Size standard: $25M. Based on the NAICS Code, state whether your company is: <br />&shy; - Small Business* (Yes / No) <br />&shy; - Woman Owned Small Business (Yes / No) <br />&shy; - Small Disadvantaged Business (Yes / No) <br />&shy; - 8(a) Certified (Yes / No) <br />&shy; - HUBZone Certified (Yes / No) <br />&shy; - Veteran Owned Small Business (Yes / No) <br />&shy; - Service Disabled Small Business (Yes / No) <br />&bull; Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (Yes / No)</p>
<p>(*) If you answered yes, please explain whether your company would be capable of meeting the requirements of FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.</p>
<p>Part B: Competition Considerations and Business Strategies.</p>
<p>Please note responses regarding this portion of the RFI may be used in the formulation of an acquisition strategy and may be shared publicly, on a non-attribution basis, during industry days and other pre-solicitation activities. Therefore, only non-proprietary, non-sensitive responses shall be provided. Market research will include responses from the following questions listed below:</p>
<p>a) Describe briefly the capabilities of your company and the nature of the goods and/or services you provide. Include a description of your staff composition and management structure.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service requires engineering and mechanical services to retrofit the HVAC system and complete related tasks in the Kealia Pond National Wildlife refuge Headquarters/Visitor Center Building in Kihei, Maui Island, Hawaii (Maui County).  

The Kealia Pond Headquarters/Visitor Center Building is a fairly new building. Construction was completed and the building was initially occupied in February 2012. The Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning (HVAC) system in the building is a central station air handling unit with (4) 6-ton fan cooling units and (1) 1-ton fan cooling unit along with air cooled water chillers manufactured by the Trane Company.  The climate in Hawaii is humid particularly in the winter months when the temperatures are cooler and the precipitation levels increase. The building is located in a wetland area downwind of agricultural operations and near the ocean, and recently surface mold has been found on internal walls.

Magnitude of project is between $250,000.00 and $500,000.00.  Period of performance is 180 days from issuance of notice to proceed. Proposals that exceed $150,000.00 and that do not include a twenty (20) percent bid bond of the total price quoted with their proposal submission will be considered nonresponsive.  The successful awardee will be asked to provide a 100 percent payment and performance bond within 15 days of award.  Project is restricted to small businesses.  Applicable NAICS code is 238220.  Small business size is defined as $15 million or less annually when averaged over a three year period.  

Site Visit - Firms interested in attending a site visit will meet on Tuesday, November 3, 2106 at 10 AM local time.  If attending the site visit please contact Courtney Brown at office phone (808) 268-6316 and directions will be provided on where contractors will meet.   Questions from the site visit need to be email to Karl_Lautzenheiser@fws.gov by close of business Thursday, November 5, 2016.  Those questions will be consolidated and answers provided by issuance of an amendment the following week.  

Scope of Work:  The Contractor shall provide engineering and installation services to modify the HVAC system in the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge Headquarters/Visitor Center Building.  More specifically the Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment and materials necessary to complete the listed tasks.  This includes three base tasks: Install electric reheat per construction drawings provided, move two outside air intakes, and modify building controls & Graphical User Interface (GUI) Graphics. Five separately priced options may be awarded based on government need and available resources. Option 1: design and install Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) fans in the four AH units with the electric reheat coils, Option 2: design and add 15kW of solar panels & appurtenances to existing PV system, Option 3: clean ducts, Option 4: One Year HVAC Maintenance Services Contract, Option 5: design and add chiller hot side coil reheat if feasible.  In conjunction with the requirements of the basic contract, the Contractor shall procure and install any new equipment, service disconnects, power cable runs, and/or distribution panels as necessary to meet current National Electrical Code (NEC) and National Electrical Safety standards.  

No government equipment or materials shall be provided during the contract unless arranged and agreed upon prior to use with the Refuge Manager. Normal duty hours are Monday through Friday 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM local time. Work shall be performed during these hours unless prearranged with the Refuge Manager.  Federal holidays not included. 

Source selection process will be trade off.  Government will make a best overall value/benefit decision taking into account the following factors: Technical Capability, Experience, Past Performance and Price. Technical Capability, Experience and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than Price. The Government may award using the proposal that is effectively ranked with the highest points and determined to be the best value to the Government considering all of these evaluation factors. 

Solicitation Number F16PS00013 and attachments will be posted to FedBizOpps hereafter with proposals due on September 19, 2015 at 3PM PDT.  No further notice will be posted on Fedbizopps.

<DESC><p>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), Contracting Division, Systems Section (DITCO/PL8223), 2300 East Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5406, intends to issue a sole source award to General Dynamics C4 Systems, Inc. (GDC4S) to provide secure browsing licenses and associated policy modifications for up to 1,000 Department of Defense (DoD) Mobility Classified Capability (DMCC) Integrated Commercial Solution (ICS) Secret (DMCC-S) devices. <br /><br />These licenses and associated policies must be purchased and implemented through GDC4S to continue the existing National Security Administration (NSA) approved secure baseline configuration of the classified capability on the device. The GDC4S baseline configuration image is the only NSA device approved for use at the enterprise level for DMCC. The DMCC ICS device baseline configurations ensure interoperability amongst the DMCC components, providing the following capabilities; device integrity, secure browsing, secure email, secure voice, internet protocol security, virtual private network connectivity, policy enforcement and mobile device management. The license and policy updates required to meet the DMCC secure browsing capability will provide a NSA required encryption, managing the device security policies, actively monitoring threats to the device and providing a robust security layer to the entire device, enabling the secure browsing. GDC4S is the only approved trusted integrator on NSA's Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) integrator list that can readily support these required licenses with secure browsing modifications on the existing NSA approved DMCC ICS device baseline image.</p>
<p>The DMCC is a joint effort between the DISA and the NSA. In June 2014, the NSA competitively awarded integration contract, H98230-14-C-0596, to meet the DMCC Program needs. In addition to providing DISA with secure DMCC-S devices, this contract provided for the secure browsing capability, associated licensing and policy updates. The current licenses to support this capability expire in November 2015 and must be renewed to prevent Information Assurance (IA) security gaps on the device. This effort will ensure the registered DMCC-S user's device can operate securely.</p>
<p>The mobile license and policies required must provide device security management and encryption capability, mandated by NSA, to maintain the secure baseline configuration of the classified capability on the device. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>All responsible sources will be considered in evaluating the determination to issue a sole-source contract. Quotations or proposals received in response to this notice cannot be accepted since this synopsis cannot be considered a request for quote or a request for proposal.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to award a firm-fixed price contract in November 2015 with a period of performance of one year.</p>

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
This acquisition is for 1200 vials of Glassia 1000mg/vial.  Glassia (Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor -Human) is used as a chronic augmentation and maintenance therapy in adults with alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency	

	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $276,000.00	

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   Date of award  through the end of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016.	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
Glassia, which is marketed in the U.S. through a strategic partnership by Baxter International Inc., is the first and only ready-to-use liquid alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (Alpha1-PI) approved by the FDA and is indicated as a chronic augmentation and maintenance therapy in adults with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD, or Inherited Emphysema).	
	

1	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
 (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)
The company uses its proprietary platform technology and know-how for the extraction and purification of proteins from human plasma to produce Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) in a highly-purified, liquid form, as well as other plasma-derived proteins. AAT is a protein derived from human plasma with known and newly-discovered therapeutic roles given its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, tissue-protective and antimicrobial properties. The Company's flagship product is Glassia, the first and only liquid, ready-to-use, intravenous plasma-derived AAT product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.	

0	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________

0	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
Baxalta US, Inc is on a mandatory NAC schedule (Pharmaceuticals and Drugs, Category 42-2A) contract number V797P-2140D.  Glassia (Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor -Human) is the first and only ready-to-use liquid alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (Alpha1-PI) and is indicated as a chronic augmentation and maintenance therapy in adults with alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency.  There are no other treatments for adults with alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency without this medication these patients will go without treatment.	

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Market Research was conducted via the internet, GSA Advantage!,  and the National Acquisition Center (NAC).  No other schedule holders were found that could provide the requirement.  Glassia is only distributed by Baxalta US, Inc.	

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
None.	

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
The Pharmacy Service will continue to monitor the availability of this medication and watch for generics or additional drugs that can be used for this disorder. Competition will be sought when there are other offerors of this drug.	

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.

The systems shall be automated, closed systems. The systems shall be capable of thawing frozen blood, providing a minimum blood shelf life of 10 days, and of glycerolizing and deglycerolizing blood. The Armed Forces Blood Program (AFBP) must have a biologics license from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to use the processors in the AFBP's operations. The power requirement is 220 VAC, 50 Hz.<br />Vendor shall be an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) authorized maintenance contractor for the proposed equipment/systems such that OEM warranty and service are provided and maintained by the OEM. All software licensing, warranty and service associated with the equipment/system shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.<br />The systems shall be compliant with the FDA requirements to market and deliver medical products for use in the United States of America; even should delivery be requested outside of the United States. The claims made for the product shall comply with the regulations of the FDA with respect to products for marketing and delivery of a medical product for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States. The system shall be installed in compliance with OSHA requirements.<br />4. Identification of the statutory exceptions permitting other than full and open competition.<br />than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) and FAR 13.501(a), sole source (including brand name) acquisitions.<br />Form 02.4G.AB/N6264515RCP3504 1 Nov 2012<br />5. Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.<br />The AFBP has an FDA biologics license to use the Haemonetics Automatic Cell Processor, Model 215 in its blood program operations. The AFBP is licensed by the FDA, contingent on the AFBP's adherence to the processes detailed in the approved instruction, TM 8-227-11/NAVMED P-5123/AFI 44-118, dated 1 September 2007. The approved process allows donated blood to be glycerolized and frozen for long-term shelf life, and then thawed and deglycerolized with at least 10 days of shelf life prior to transfusion. The AFBP does not have an FDA biologics license to use any other glycerolization/deglycerolization centrifugal blood cell processor. The Haemonetics Automatic Cell Processor (ACP) Model 215 is the only product available that can meet the minimum requirements of the government. The ACP 215 is the only instrument capable of thawing frozen blood, providing a minimum blood shelf life of 10 days, and of glycerolizing and deglycerolizing blood. Haemonetics Corporation is the sole manufacturer and distributor of ACP, Model 215 glycerolization/deglycerolization centrifugal blood cell processors. There are no other manufacturers or distributors of the Haemonetics ACP, Model 215. The AFBP must inform the FDA of any equipment or process changes than those specifically detailed in the current FDA biologic license and obtain approval before implementing any such changes. At present, no other vendor or product is capable of meeting the minimum requirements of the government<br />6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable.<br />Market research was performed, the results of which are in paragraph 8. This requirement will be posted to NECO and/or FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.202. The government will evaluate any responses received.<br />7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.<br />The Contracting Officer shall determine the anticipated cost to the Government of the supplies/services covered by this Justification and Approval will be fair and reasonable by conducting a price analysis before an award is made. In addition, the Government anticipates that the negotiated contract price will reflect a discount from the vendor's commercial price list and will be determined fair and reasonable.<br />8. Description of the market survey conducted and the results, or statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.<br />Market research was conducted in July 2015. The market research conducted included research conducted by the internet, and review of product literature. The internet search was done using Google, Bing, GSA Advantage, and the ECRI Sourcebook. Haemonetics Corporation is the only vendor which can provide a glycerolization/deglycerolization centrifugal blood cell processor which meets the minimum requirements. Hettich Lab, Thermo Scientific and Helmer Scientific also manufacture blood cell washer systems, but these products are not capable of<br />Form 02.4G.AB/N6264515RCP3504 1 Nov 2012<br />glycerolization/deglycerolization and thus do not meet the minimum requirements. Terumo BCT manufactures a blood cell processor system capable of glycerolization/deglycerolization, but its thawed blood products do not meet the requirement of having a minimum shelf life of 10 days and thus it does not meet the minimum requirements. Only the Haemonetics ACP, Model 215 is FDA approved to thaw frozen blood through glycerolization/deglycerolization and provide a minimum shelf life of 10 days. No product other than the Haemonetics ACP, Model 215 is currently capable of meeting the minimum requirements. If another make and model blood cell processor were procured that met the minimum requirement, the AFBP would need to modify its FDA biologics license to use this different processor. The time required to complete FDA biologic licensing process would delay fulfilling the current requirement for at least/approximately 24 months. Therefore, the Haemonetics ACP, Model 215 provided by Haemonetics Corporation is the only system that can meet the Government's requirements.<br />9. Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.<br />Previous acquisition:<br />Contract N62645-13-P-2034 dated 26 June 2014 for a total amount of $114,864.00. This procurement was conducted in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) Soliciting from a single source.<br />10. Listing of Sources, if any, which expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.<br />To date, no other sources have written to express an interest. This requirement will be posted on FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.202. Any sources expressing interest in response to the synopsis will receive consideration.<br />11. Statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.<br />Future requirements will be synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.203. For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 5, Naval Medical Logistics Command has no plans at this time to compete future contracts for the types of supplies/services covered by this document. If another potential source emerges, Naval Medical Logistics Command will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible. However, there is constant attention to the market to insure that shall technology change, the source selection is reconsidered.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL<br />OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />1. Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.<br />This justification is executed by the Naval Medical Logistics Command, Fort Detrick, MD to meet the requirements of<br />2. Nature and/or description of the action.<br />The proposed action is for two (2) ea. heart-lung bypass units [11-969] with associated modules and components for Naval Medical Center San Diego. The Government intends on awarding a Firm Fixed Price contract. The proposed source is Sorin Group USA Inc, 14401 W. 65th Way, Arvada, CO 80004, or an authorized Sorin distributer.<br />3. Description of Supplies or Services:<br />Naval Medical Center San Diego has a requirement for two (2) ea. heart-lung bypass units [11-969] with associated modules and components. The systems shall be able to provide temporary external circulatory support for open heart surgery. The systems shall be able to oxygenate venous blood and pump it throughout the arterial system. The systems shall be consistent with the equipment utilized by currently trained contractor personnel (Apex Perfusion, Inc.) to ensure the safety of the patients during cardiac procedures.<br />The system shall be modular in design, and individual components and modules shall be able to be added and removed from the system. The system shall have a mast system for the positioning of different accessories. The systems shall have an emergency uninterruptible power supply equipped with a manual crank. The uninterruptible power supply shall be capable of up to 90 minutes of bypass operating time depending on the workload. The system shall have two (2) ea. single roller pumps and two (2) ea. double roller pumps that are operable in continuous or pulse mode. At least one of the single roller pumps shall be mast mountable. The system shall include one (1) ea. centrifugal pump. The system shall have a locking wheel/knob mechanism for inclusion adjustment to prevent accidental adjustment. The system shall have an arterial line clamp. The system shall have at least two pressure sensors and at least four temperature sensors. The system shall be capable of monitoring venous saturation, hematocrit, and venous temperature. The system shall be able to stop the connected pump when an air bubble is detected within the tubing. The system shall have a level sensor capable of detecting when blood falls below acceptable levels in the unit. The system shall have both audible and visual alarms. The system shall have an electronic gas blender with four connectors for Air, O2, CO2, and total gas flow. The system shall have at least three timers which can be set independently. The unit shall have an attached LED lamp. The system shall have cable holding and organizing systems and clamps to allow for proper positioning of the system during procedures. The power requirement for the heart-lung bypass unit is 120VAC, 60Hz.<br />The system shall also include a warming/cooling unit, patient, heart-lung bypass [17-206]. The warming/cooling unit shall have separate cold and warm water tanks to allow for fast changes between warm and cold cardioplegia. The warming/cooling unit shall have a separate water<br />Form 02.4G.AB 1 Nov 2012<br />circuit for controlling the temperature of the patient and for controlling the temperature of the cardioplegia solution. The power requirement for the warming/cooling units is 120VAC, 60Hz.<br />Vendor shall be an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) authorized maintenance contractor for the proposed equipment/systems such that OEM warranty and service are provided and maintained by the OEM. All software licensing, warranty and service associated with the equipment/system shall be in accordance with the OEM terms and conditions.<br />The system shall be compliant with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements to market and deliver medical products for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States. The claims made for the product shall comply with the regulations of the FDA with respect to products for marketing and delivery of a medical product for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States. The system shall be installed in compliance with OSHA requirements.<br />Upon delivery, the vendor shall be responsible for uncrating the unit/system, transporting it through the facility to the location of intended use for installation, and removing of all trash created in this process. If interim storage is required, the vendor shall make arrangements for the storage.<br />o<br />other than full and open competition.<br />The statutory exception permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 13.501(a) sole source (including brand name) acquisitions . There are multiple distributors capable of providing the equipment that meets the minimum government requirements.<br />5. Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.<br />Sorin Group USA, Inc. is the only manufacturer that can provide a heart-lung bypass unit that meets the requirements of Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD). There are no other manufacturers that can provide heart-lung bypass units consistent with the equipment utilized by currently trained contractor personnel (Apex Perfusion, Inc.). Apex Perfusion, Inc. provides a Certified Clinical Perfusionist (CCP) for cardiac surgeries at NMC San Diego and works at multiple facilities, working with the same equipment platform for all heart-lung bypass procedures. It is a typical practice for CCPs to rotate among various facilities due to their specialized knowledge/experience and the relative low volume of open heart procedures performed at any one given facility. The workload for the CCP at NMCSD is approximately 7 - 8 per month. The CCP contract at NMCSD requires a minimum of three years' experience within the previous five year period. For that experience to be considered relevant, both technical competence and clinical proficiency with the equipment platform must be<br />Form 02.4G.AB 1 Nov 2012<br />demonstrated with an average caseload of 75 - 100 cardiopulmonary bypass cases per year. It is not feasible for the existing CCP to become proficient on a platform other than Sorin. Given the life sustaining quality of this type of equipment, a change in the personnel contractor (Apex Perfusion, Inc.) could decrease patient safety and result in significant risk of patient death. If a heart-lung bypass unit from another manufacturer were acquired, Apex Perfusion, Inc. would not be capable of providing the same standard of patient care and safety. Additionally, the ubiquity of Sorin equipment decreases the likelihood of a CCP possessing the required experience on another platform. Sorin Group USA, Inc. is the only manufacturer that can meet the minimum requirements of the Government. There are multiple Sorin authorized distributers that could potentially meet the requirement.<br />6. Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable.<br />Market research was performed, the results of which are in paragraph 8. This requirement will be posted to NECO and/or FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.202. The Government will evaluate any responses received.<br />7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.<br />The Contracting Officer shall determine the anticipated cost to the Government of the supplies/services covered by this Justification and Approval will be fair and reasonable by conducting a price analysis before an award is made. In addition, the Government anticipates that the negotiated contract price will reflect a discount from the vendor's commercial price list and will be determined fair and reasonable.<br />8. Description of the market survey conducted and the results, or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.<br />Market research was conducted in March 2015. It included a search of the Internet using Google, Bing, GSA Advantage, and the ECRI Sourcebook. Manufacturers which can provide heart-lung bypass units include Sorin, Medtronic, Maquet, and Terumo. Medtronic, Maquet, and Terumo have similar heart-lung bypass units but these units are not consistent (i.e. different user interface, location of components and varying technology) with the units utilized by Apex Perfusion, Inc. Sorin Group USA, Inc. is the only manufacturer that can meet the requirements of the Government. There are multiple Sorin authorized distributers that could potentially meet the requirement.<br />9. Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.<br />None<br />10. Listing of Sources, if any, which expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.<br />Form 02.4G.AB 1 Nov 2012<br />To date, no other sources have written to express an interest. This requirement will be posted on FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.202. Any sources expressing interest in response to the synopsis will receive consideration.<br />11. Statement of actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.<br />Future requirements will be synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.203.<br />For the reasons set forth in Paragraph 5, NMLC has no plans at this time to compete future contacts for the types of supplies/services covered by this document. If another potential source emerges, (NMLC) will assess whether competition for future requirements is feasible. However, there is constant attention to the market to insure that shall technology change, the source selection is reconsidered. U.S. Navy Subject Matter Experts are required to take into consideration the impact on the installed base of equipment when source selection occurs. All necessary components of integrated logistics support are taken into consideration.<br />The Government (or Program Office) expects to obtain a technical data package that will support competition for future acquisitions of the same or similar items.<br />12.

Justification and Approval (J&A) For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)


Acquisition Plan Action ID:	VA248-15-AP-13169

1.	Contracting Activity:

Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 8, West Palm Beach Medical Center Network Contracting Office 8, Service Area Office-East
Purchase Request: 548-16-1-229-0004

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:

Subpart 13.5-Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items: This procurement is for an interim, sole source, fixed-price, requirements contract for Radiopharmaceuticals in accordance with FAR 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items and specifically FAR 13.501           Special Documentation Requirements, where acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2. The current contract expires 9/30/2015 and the existing solicitation was protested 9/8/2015 and was due to close 9/9/2015. To avoid a potential break in services caused by trying to transition another contractor to take over current operations, this interim contract shall be with the incumbent, Cardinal Health 414 LLC, 7000 Cardinal Place, Dublin, Ohio 43017 --- for a 3 month period to allow for a long-term contract to be re-solicited, competed, and awarded.


3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:

The Department of Veterans Affairs requires radiopharmaceuticals for the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center's Nuclear Medicine Service. Nuclear Medicine has an ongoing need for exams requiring radiopharmaceuticals, as well as for therapeutic procedures. The veterans' exams are based upon the needs and orders of referring physicians, and all Nuclear Medicine exams require the injection or ingestion of a radiopharmaceutical.

Contractor provides daily routine deliveries as well as emergent deliveries. Routine weekday (M-F) delivery times; West Palm Beach VAMC, between 6:00 am and 6:30 am for 1st delivery Monday through Friday and between 9:00 am and 9:30 am (2nd daily delivery) and between 12:30 am and 1:00 pm (3rd delivery) and between 2:00 pm and 2:30 pm (4th delivery). Saturday and Sunday scheduled deliveries are between 7:00 am and 7:30 am and between 12:00 am and 12:30 am. Cut off for ordering is 45 minutes before delivery Monday through Friday and 4:30 am for first run and 8:15 am for second run on weekends. However, VA may require Emergency orders within one hour during business hours and two hours after hours of receiving the order by phone or electronic order (web ordering).

Contractor provides emergency orders placed during regular work hours (Monday through Friday 6:00 am to 4:30 pm) within 60 minutes after receipt of phoned or faxed orders from the West Palm Beach VAMC.
 
Contractor provides nuclear medicine laboratory information management software and hardware, with HL7 capabilities that shall be compatible with the facility's data storage/back-up devices i.e.
SQL server. The computerized record system for nuclear medicine information includes database conversion services to migrate and manage legacy data and provide clinical applications for remote use with on-line and on-site customer training.

Considering all of this, it is estimated that transitioning to a new contractor is estimated to take up  to 60 days. Therefore, an interim contract with the incumbent is required to avoid a potential break in services as a long-term contract is worked on.

The total estimated value for the 3 month interim contract is approximately $423,529.27. The effective period of performance shall be 10/1/15 - 12/31/15 to allow for a long-term, competitively awarded contract to be put in place.


4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:
( ) (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
(X) (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
( ) (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
( ) (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
( ) (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5; ( ) (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
( ) (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;


5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):

The Contracting Officer is contemplating an award under the authority cited in FAR 6.302-2 based upon the fact that these radiopharmaceuticals are needed regularly and are essential for healthcare delivery and mission performance. It could take up to 60 days to transition to a new contractor and such an interruption of and/or delay in the continued supply of these essential radiopharmaceuticals to the patients requiring their use, could potentially pose a serious injury to the Government should veteran care be adversely impacted as the existing contract expires 9/30/15, as well as the protest filed on 9/8/15 delayed the ultimate award of a timely action. The need for the use of Unusual and Compelling Urgency was created as a result of corrective action in response to the GAO protest.

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:

Solicitation VA248-15-R-1322 was issued on a competitive basis and subsequently protested under GAO file number B-412053. After careful review of the protest grounds and the procurement file, the Agency elected to take action to correct the solicitation. These changes to the solicitation will better reflect the Agency's requirement while facilitating maximum competition among potential offerors. Awarding the 3 month interim contract to the incumbent will enable the Agency to continue to support critical veteran care while implementing the corrective actions necessary to further full and open competition.
 
7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable

The Contracting Officer requested an quote from the incumbent contractor for a 3 month, sole source, interim contract to allow time to re-solicit for a long-term contract. Pricing has been compared to current pricing and has been determined to be equal to what is being paid currently and is therefore, both fair and reasonable.
8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:

Market research demonstrates the existence of at least 3 contractors who may be capable of meeting Agency needs. Market research documentation is on file.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:

While other contractors exist who can provide radiopharmaceuticals, none are able to do so -- immediately - without a break in services. Therefore, issuing a 3 month interim sole source contract to the incumbent will allow the Agency to support critical veteran care while implementing the corrective actions necessary to further full and open competition.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:

East Coast Nuclear Pharmacy
Caring Hands Health Equipment & Supplies, LLC. TrillaMed, LLC.
GE Healthcare Cardinal Health IBA Molecular

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:

A long-term contract is currently being processed and this interim action is strictly for the continued delivery of radiopharmaceuticals while the long-term contract is being put into place.

12.	Requirements Certification: The requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
