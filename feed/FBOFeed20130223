Lockheed Martin is the design agent, system integrator and the NAVSEA approved source of supply and certified depot for the AN/UYQ-70(V) weapon system. NAVSUP WSS does not possess the necessary engineering drawing masters, developmental specifications, engineering change data, interface specifications, etc. required
to source these parts to another vendor other than Lockheed Martin. NAVSUP WSS does not have required Navy technical support activity (TSA) or in-service engineering support approval to parts procured or repaired by sources other than
Lockheed Martin. Data is not currently available for competition; however NAVSUP
WSS has requested Lockheed Martin to provide detailed analysis and justification
for value-added parts. Upon receipt of this data it will be reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community, which will allow the NAVSUP WSS to properly breakout parts without negatively impacting host weapon system certification, configuration management and operating systems. This review is expected to take up to a year due to the range of the items in the AN/UYQ-70(V) product line. -SEE NOTES 9, 22, 26

<DESC><p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">The Department of the Navy (DON) is requesting information from the marketplace for a Defense Business System (DBS) information technology (IT) solution to replace the contract writting capabilities of the existing legacy Department of Defense (DoD) Standard Procrurement System (SPS) and/or the DON's other legacy contract writting systems in its environment. The current concept system is called the DON Electronic Procurement System (EPS). The EPS must leverage advanced and general IT capabilities to support the DON's acquisition community. The EPS must: have the capability to support approximately 10,000 contracts specialists and other customers world-wide with the full range of procurement services and functions; interface with the current and evolving set of Federal, DoD, and DON acquisition and financial management and reporting systems; have digital signature capability; and have foreign currency capability.</p>
<p>The DON is currently conducting an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) with respect to the EPS and responders to this RFI are invited to provide written input and potentially voluntarily participate in a public workshop to critique and contribute to the DON approach to the Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). The goal of this RFI and workshop is to share with IT industry representatives (e.g., IT consultants and integrators) the DON's Alternative Definitions, Architecture, Measures of Effectives and Problem Statement in order to receive input on (i) lessons-learned from industry experience which may benefit or improve the DON's approach, or (ii) information on new or different approaches not currently being considered, understood, or known by the DON. In this way, industry representatives can assist DoN in refining or improving the Government requirements development/definition process for the EPS capability. For DON to assess the impartiality of advice/input received, and help identify potential organizational conflicts of interest, responders to this RFI shall inform the DON of relevant business affiliations.</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
