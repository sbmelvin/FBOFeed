<DESC><p>FA8620-09-C-3024, APX-119/KIV-119 IFF Transponder Equipment is for the 703 Aeronautical System Group (AESG) Predator/Reaper program requirements. The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), 703&nbsp;AESG intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Raytheon Network Centric systems, 1300 East Joppa Rd, Baltimore, MD 21286-59990 for 100 each APX-119 and KIV-119 with 5 repairs for each, plus three options for additional quantities (three options with quantities of 10 each APX-119/KIV-119 plus a fourth option for 5 repairs). This procurement is in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. Raytheon produces the APX-119/KIV-119 transponder which has the required form, fit and function for the Predator/Reaper production and necessary spares. The basis for restricting competition is duplicative cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Government's requirements if an alternate source is utilized. As the MQ-1 and MQ-9 are size and weight limited platforms with unique software interfaces, utilizing another source would require significant development and testing to support integration. The POC for information regarding this requirement is Mr. Robert Johnson, telephone 937-904-8165 or email robert.johnson4@wpafb.af.mil; e-mail request is preferred. Technical questions should be referred to Mr. Roger Rose at 937-904-7011, E-Mail: roger.rose@wpafb.af.mil .

This requirement will be negotiated on a sole source basis with Raytheon Network Centric Systems, 1300 E Joppa Rd Baltimore, MD 21286-59990 in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>

<SUBJECT>70 -- NETCENTS 1 EXTENSION
<SOLNBR>R2026
<CONTACT>Harry Bryan harry.bryan@gunter.af.mil

<a href="mailto:harry.bryan@gunter.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>This serves as "Notice of Intent" of the Air Force's 754th Electronic Systems Group's intent to issue a modification to extend the ordering period and the period of performance of the basic Air Force mandatory use Network- Centric Solutions (NETCENTS) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts on a sole source basis.  The existing NETCENTS contracts are FA877104D0002 (The Centech Group), FA877104D0003 (Harris Corporation (Formerly Small Business known as "Multimax")), FA877104D0004 (Northrop Grumman), FA877104D0005 (NCI Inc.), FA877104D0006 (Booz Allen Hamilton), FA877104D0007 (General Dynamics), FA877104D0008 (Lockheed Martin), FA877104D0009 (Telos Corporation).  The  extended ordering period is for an additional two years beginning 10 Sep 2009 - 09 Sep 2010, to include one option year period 10 Sep 2010 through 09 Sep 2011, with a period of performance through 9 Sep 2012.  The Air Force plans to extend the ordering period and the period of performance ! for the eight NETCENTS contracts under the authority of Title 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B).   There would be significant risk to AF and DoD networks if NETCENTS-1 is not extended to bridge the gap between it and NETCENTS-2.  Without the bridge, solutions being implemented may result in non-standards based contracts and conflict with AF and DoD vision and policy for standard, secure and interoperable architectures across the various Mission Areas.  Specifically, the NETCENTS contracts are designed to facilitate the AF requirement for IT investments to be managed as portfolios per AFI 33-141, Air Force Information Technology Portfolio Management and IT Investment Review.  Portfolio managers look to the Air Force Enterprise Architecture (AF EA) as a framework for guidance to developing solutions based on lower-level architectures that are in alignment with AF vision, strategies, and plans.  NETCENTS requires contractors to provide solutions th! at adhere to Global Information Grid (GIG), ConstellationNet, Infostructure Technology Reference Model (i-TRM), Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) (now the DoD Information Technology Standards and Profile Registry (DISR) Online) and other DoD technical architecture standards.  These constraints help achieve alignment with the AF EA and Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) requirements and ensure interoperability and supportability.  Among the standards prescribed are those that ensure the early and continuous incorporation of information assurance (IA) into system lifecycles.  They include DOD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) and National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (NIACAP) standards and certifications.  NETCENTS also ensures security technicians and managers are trained IAW DoDDI 8570.1, and IA and IA-enabled products comply with common criteria for COTS product evaluations via NSTISSP #11.  Moreover, the NETCENTS contracts support the Air Force requirement for gov! ernance structures that provide visibility into AF IT acquisition spending and enable centralized management and control; and supports the Air Force requirement to support strategic sourcing.  Interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within 15 days after the publication date of this notice of contract action.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 517110. Inquiries can be mailed to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Harry Bryan, 490 East Moore Drive, Suite 270, Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex, AL 36114 or  faxed to Mr. Bryan using (334) 416-4668 or e-mailed to harry.bryan@gunter.af.mil.  Numbered Notes 9, 22, and 26 apply.

<a href="mailto:kathleen.delgado@hanscom.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>DESC:  Notification of Contract Action (NOCA).  This Hanscom AFB Electronic Request for proposal Bulletin Board (HERBB) announcement constitutes a Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) for proposed award of a sole source contract to Boeing Company Huntington Beach, CA to purchase Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T) and associated spare parts.  This will be a Fixed Price (FP) contract for Low Initial Rate Production (LRIP) in Fiscal Years (FY) 2010, 2011 and 2012.  The authority for this action is FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).
The Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminal (FAB-T) Program is an evolutionary acquisition program to provide a family of Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) Satellite Communications (SATCOM) and Line of Sight (LOS) terminals.  The FAB-T Program will deliver terminals capable of providing strategic, Anti-Jam, Low Probability of Interception, Low Probability of Detection, and nuclear survivable communications for Advanced Extremely High Frequency Advanced Wideband Terminal connectivity for various aircraft and also upgrade the existing ground-fixed, ground-transportable, and airborne (E-4 and E-6) Command Post Terminals.  
 Boeing Company C3I division is the original FAB-T development contractor.  Award to any other offeror would result in significant duplication of costs and an unacceptable delay in the delivery and fielding of FAB-Ts required by warfighters.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however the government will consider all responses received within 15 business days of the issuance of this notice. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  An ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  Before consulting the Ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendation to the Contracting Officer Mr. Timothy M. Frank, Timothy.Frank@hanscom.af.mil, 781-271-7188 or the Contract Specialist, Ms. Kathleen Delgado, 781-271-5133 for resolution.  In addition, AFFARS 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, will be included in this acquisition's solicitation and contract. The ESC Ombudsman can be contacted at: ESC Ombudsman, Bldg 1606, 9 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB, MA  01731, Telephone #:  781-377-5106, Facsimile #:  781-377-4659, E-Mail:  ESC.Ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil

<DESC><p>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov. The United States Air Force (USAF) intends to procure the following items on a sole source basis: Five (5) Reliability Enhancement Re-engine Program (RERP) devices and six (6) Avionics Modernization program (AMP) devices applicable to the C-5 Aircrew Training System (ATS). Purchase of the AMP devices/kits will include modification efforts, both hardware and software, required to configure the C-5 Weapon System Trainers (WST) and the Cockpit Procedure Trainers (CPT) to the AMP configuration. Purchase of the RERP devices will include development, modification and integration, to include both hardware and software, to develop a C-5 RERP ATS design to modify the C-5 AMP devices to the new C-5 RERP configuration. These items will be acquired from CAE (cage 50237) utilizing FAR Part 15 procedures. Statutory authority permitting the use of other than full and open competition: 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.

<DESC><p>NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB): Development and Delivery of the Bi-Strategic Command (Bi-SC) Automated Information System (AIS) NATO Common Operational Picture (NCOP)</p>
<p>IFB-CO-12780-NCOP</p>
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to invite bids for the development and delivery of NATO Common Operation Picture (NCOP) in support of the joint level of commands, components commands, and national commands.</p>
<p>The NCOP project is intended to provide Common CoI (Community of Interest, formerly referred to as Functional) Services to manage and deliver the Common Operational Picture as a fully integrated component of the Bi-Strategic Command (Bi-SC) Automated Information System (AIS) and to serve as a baseline for future enhancement.</p>
<p>These services are required to complement the Bi-SC AIS core services with an integrated and supported suite of joint situational awareness services capable of supporting the work of the staff at all static and deployable command facilities of the NATO command structure. The NATO COP Increment 1 (NCOP-1) capability is envisioned to receive, manage, and disseminate situational awareness information and products produced or needed by other Bi-SC AIS functional areas, such as the Recognized Pictures from components commands, Order of Battle information, and the authoritative joint Common Operational Picture itself, according to operational needs.</p>
<p>The project will be implemented based on a Spiral Development approach that will be executed in three increments to complete the NCOP capability. Each increment should provide an integral, usable, and operationally-fielded capability.</p>
<p>The current project authorization covers the development, fielding, and initial operational support of NCOP Increment 1, an initial operational capability (IOC) that will be fielded to authorized NATO Command Structure sites. Increment 1 will then serve as the baseline for further enhancement in subsequent increments. NCOP Increment 1 will include support for a Missile Defense Picture as part of the initial set of Theatre Missile Defense capabilities within the Bi-SC AIS. The schedule goal for Increment 1 is to deliver the NCOP IOC to a set of pilot sites within 15 months after the effective date of contract.</p>
<p>NC3A is serving as the NATO contracting agency for this project, which is being funded within the framework of the Infrastructure Committee. The envisaged bidding procedure for this Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be the Optional Preliminary Bidding Procedure. As that is the case, the formal IFB will be preceded by a Request for Bidders' Views (RFBV), which will provide the draft IFB documentation to nominated bidders for comments.</p>
<p>NC3A will review the comments provided by the bidders and conduct a series of one-on-one meetings with responding bidders. Bidder feedback and findings from RFBV reviews will then be incorporated when appropriate into the formal IFB for this contract.</p>
<p>Bidders will be required to declare a bid validity of 12 months from the closing date for receipt of bids, supported by a bid guarantee of Euro 100,000. Should the selection and award procedure exceed the bid closing date by more than 12 months, firms will be requested to extend the validity of their bids and bid guarantee accordingly. Bidders may decline to do so, withdraw their bid, and excuse themselves from the bidding process without penalty.</p>
<p>It is the intent of NC3A that the selected Increment 1 contractor be retained to develop and deliver subsequent increments under the framework of the proposed contract. This assumes the successful delivery of each preceding increment and is subject to NATO Infrastructure Committee authorization of this sole source procurement. Further, as required under the Two Stage Authorization Procedure, NC3A will need to obtain financial authorization from the NATO Infrastructure Committee prior to the actual award of the NCOP Increment 1 contract.</p>
<p>A summary of the requirements of the program is set forth in the attachment. These requirements are being refined and detailed as part of the preparation of the NCOP proposed contract. The attachment also outlines the projected functions to be delivered in subsequent increments of this project.</p>
<p>Interested firms will be invited to present their COP-related experiences during an NCOP Industry Workshop. The purpose of this event is to ensure that NCOP capitalizes on lessons learned with national COP implementation. The organization scheme of the NCOP Industry Workshop is detailed in the attachment.</p>
<p><br />The rough cost estimate for the implementation component of Increment 1 capability is Euro 10 million. The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-12780-NCOP. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>Bidding documents, including technical specifications applicable to the bidding and contractual documents, are expected to be NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Bidders may also be given access to a bidders library that may include material up to the level of NATO SECRET. The IFB will provide the required details for accessing the stated library. Performance of the contract will also require that contractors have personnel and facility clearances at the level of NATO SECRET.</p>
<p>The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NATO contracting agency the NATO clearance certifications needed for performance of the contract.</p>
<p>Bids received in response to the IFB will be evaluated through a Best Value approach. The top-level bid evaluations criteria with their associated weightings will be 50% for price and 50% for technical. The second level criteria for technical evaluation areas will be engineering, 55%; management 22.5%, and supportability, 22.5%.</p>
<p>When the bid evaluation is completed, the weighted price score for each bidder will be obtained through the weighted average of the stated evaluation factors by using the weights specified and the following formula:</p>
<p>Price Score = 100*(1-(Bid Price/(2 x Average Bid Price))</p>
<p>The solicitation will include a requirement for prospective bidders to demonstrate their financial ability to undertake this project and mandatory criteria for extensive experience with the provision of similar types of systems.</p>
<p>Please note that the IFB, at the time of its issuance, will contain an exclusion provision concerning the Bi-SC AIS Program Management and Integrations Capability (PMIC) contract. The language of the exclusion provision is included in the attachment.</p>
<p>An exclusion provision will be inserted in the IFB with respect to the possibility of the awardee of the NCOP contract to perform at any tier of any Independent Verification and Validation efforts associated with the NCOP project.</p>

Hoover Dam is perhaps the most historically important dam structure in the United States.  It sits across the Colorado River (Nevada/Arizona boundary) and forms Lake Mead.  The dam which was built during the depression and completed in 1935 provides power generation, downstream flood protection, and water for agricultural and human consumption.

The Performance Work Statement (PWS) of the solicitation will require the contractor to provide all personnel, equipment, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary to manage and operate the photography and merchandise sales operations seven days a week, except for Thanksgiving and Christmas days.

The work will include the following principal features of work, including but not limited to:  (1)  Accept, display, sell and account for merchandise sales; (2) Take professional digital photographs of tourists, process photographs and place in an attractive folder, and sell on-site or via the Internet; (3) Account for photography sales; (4) Provide financial and managerial controls to carry out all of the tasks related to photography and merchandise sales; including maintaining a record of the number of photographs sold, merchandise sold, method of payment, price paid, and accounting for all revenue received based on fees collected; and (5) Managerial personnel must be able to read, write, speak, and understand English, and possess good customer relation skills.

<DESC>The intent of this solicitation, DARPA-BAA-09-38, Comprehensive Interior Reconnaissance, is to investigate technological approaches that leverage building infrastructure to opportunistically collect information for interior awareness. DARPA believes that opportunistic sensing may be exploited to infer urban interior building awareness using exterior observations.  Specifically, DARPA asserts that: 

	The geometry and stimulus response of building infrastructure contains tactically useful information on the interior structure.  Infrastructure includes, but is not limited to, the structural, electrical, plumbing, and ventilation systems. 

	Such information may be acquired through access to the exterior of buildings that may include direct contact with an exterior umbilical, but does not require contact or deployments within the building. 

	Approaches to acquiring such information may require active as well as passive sensing.

	Multiple sensing technologies and approaches may be required to provide complete building interior awareness. 

	A mission is expected to depend upon an optimal mix of approaches determined by the specific environment.  

DARPA is soliciting proposals to investigate and validate multiple Sensing Technology approaches that collectively meet all Program Metrics for below- and above-ground awareness.  See attached for complete BAA.

A Proposer's Day will be held on 30 April 2009 at 8:30 AM at Analytic Services Inc., Conference Center, 2900 S. Quincy St. Suite 800, Arlington, VA 22206, phone (703)416-3222, fax (703)416-8408.  The proposer's day will be held at the SECRET level.

This solicitation will be issued as an unrestricted acquisition with other than full and open competition.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract parts from approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1).

<DESC>The U.S. EPA, National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Shaw Environmental and Infrastructure Inc., under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, to provide extended on-site operations support services for the EPA-Cincinnati Test and Evaluation (T&E) Facility for the National Risk Management Research Laboratory. This action will extend the current performance period by one month to 6/30/09, and add an option to further extend the period by one additional month for a maximum expiration date of 7/31/09. This notice is not a request for proposals.  Shaw is considered uniquely qualified to meet this requirement based on their familiarity with the on-site and off-site work, its hazards and current site activities. Mobilization by another contractor would result in significant duplication of effort and cost to the Government and would cause unacceptable delays in ongoing studies. However, any firm wishing to be considered may submit technical documentation to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. A determination not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

If the Downstream Schlieren mirror recoating process is concluded on timeand there is no shift in the 10x10 testing schedule  then the vendor will remove andship the Upstream Schlieren mirrors (Set A) for recoating at the time of thereinstallation of the Downstream Schlieren mirrors.  If 10x10 testing schedule conflictsarise  the vendor may have to return at a separate date to remove and ship the mirrors at an additional cost to the Government, which will be listed as a separate line optionin the contract.Each Mirror Set(A&B)has the following quantities and properties:	36.5" ; 5 " thick Concave Off-Axis parabolas, 		Focal length approximately 20' 8 5/8" (quantity 2)	12 " ; 2 1/16" thick flat mirrors (quantity 2)		4" ; 7/8" thick flat (quantity 1)	Each mount and mirror shall be marked with a fiducial and serialized before un-mountingmirrors from cell in order to install mirrors back in the same cell in the sameorientation.Vendor shall travel to NASA GRC at prearranged time to pickup the mirrors.  NASA willassist vendor in the removal of the mirrors from the holders.  Vendor shall package eachmirror in a crate fabricated by vendor to support transporting back to vendors facilityfor strip and recoat. Vendor shall provide transportation vehicle for transporting themirrors. Vendor shall strip existing coating from mirror surfaces using a Sodium Hydroxidesolution.  No mechanical surface cleaning will be used.  No polishing or change in the mirror surface shape shall occur as a part of the strippingrecoating process.No repair of chips or pockets in mirror surface shall be performed.Mirrors shall be recoated with Al+SiO coating with **% reflectivity across the &&-** nmrange.Recoated surface scratch & dig shall be better than 80-50.Vendor shall return recoated mirrors to NASA GRC at a pre-arranged time to re-install thefive mirrors in the original mirror holders. Vendor shall prepare each mirror cell withcork and install the coated optics in the original cell and with fiducial marks aligned. Vendor shall assist in the realignment of the mirrors/Schlieren system to verify recoatedmirror installation.After the mirror Set B reinstallation is complete, Nu-Tek will proceed to follow the sameprocedures as above and re-furbish Mirror Set A.  This can occur at the time of thedelivery of recoated Mirror Set B.  If however, the 10x10 Schedule does not permitremoval of Mirror Set A at the time of delivery of Mirror Set B, The vendor may chargethe Government additional costs for travel to NASA on a separate date for pick up andtransport of Mirror Set A.NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Nu-Tek Precision Optical Corporation becausethey are uniquely qualified to perform the requisite skills, and have the facilities tohandle and process the large mirrors of the Schlieren System.

<p>PREPARATION OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT FOR FLOOD CONTROL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE ARROYO COLORADO FLOODWAY</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">&nbsp;The purpose of this scope of work is to assist the United States Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) in the preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA) with an accelerated schedule for the Arroyo Colorado Floodway (ACF) which is part of the interior floodways and it's located within Hidalgo, Cameron and Willacy counties in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas. The USIBWC Arroyo Colorado Floodway Project begins at Divisor Dike in Hidalgo County and ends at the Rio Hondo town in Cameron County. This EA, however, will focus only on two portions of the north levee: Divisor Dike to Willacy Canal and Willacy Canal to White Ranch Road. The proposed action objective includes levee system improvements to meet current flood control and Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) requirements. Various sections of the ACF levee system would be raised using fill material obtained from commercial sources. The expansion would take place along the levee service corridor currently utilized for levee maintenance, and entirely within the USIBWC right-of-way (ROW).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Excavation outside the levee structure is not anticipated. The environmental impacts associated with the proposed flood control improvements described in this EA will be tiered from the 2008 Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, as per 40 CFR 1502.20, which authorizes federal agencies to tier from existing environmental documents to focus on issues "ripe for decision." <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This project shall be completed within 60 days from issuance of the notice to proceed.</p>

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to issue 13 separate solicitations to obtain the services of experienced, licensed Medical Experts who are board certified and/or have SSA disability program experience at the State and/or Federal level, or in the absence of board certification, have SSA disability program experience combined with specialized training, to serve as Medical Experts to analyze and provide expert advice related to their specialized field, as needed, so that adjudicators can render accurate determinations and decisions. 


SSA requires Medical Expert services in the following fields: 


Pulmonary Medicine (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1027)
Internal Medicine (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1030)
Cardiology (solicitation SSA-RFP-09-1031)
Medical Oncology (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1032)
Endocrinology (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1033)
Gastroenterology (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1034)
Dermatology (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1035)
Internal Medicine Generalist (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1036)
Rheumatology (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1038)
Psychiatry (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1039)
General Surgery (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1040)
Orthopedic Surgery (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1041)
Neurology (solicitation number SSA-RFP-09-1042)

**SSA has designated these solicitations for TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE participation only** 

BACKGROUND: SSA is responsible for two national disability programs, Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSA uses a five-step sequential process for evaluating the disability claim submitted by an individual who alleges an inability to perform substantial gainful activity (SGA). The program defines disability as an inability to engage in SGA by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death, or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. A medical basis for the disability claim is required, and the State disability determination services (DDS) collect and evaluate the medical information, making a determination about the severity of the medical impairment as it relates to the claimants ability to perform SGA. 

While medical generalist may properly evaluate many disability impairments, claims that involve difficult or complex issues require medical specialist and sub-specialist expertise. 

SSA anticipates the award of multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts with provisions for the issuance of Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) task orders as needed. The IDIQ period of performance will consist of a 12-month base period with four 12-month option periods. The estimated date for release of these solicitations (the appropriate solicitation number is located with the individual Medical Expert field cited above) is on/about March 30, 2009, with proposals due approximately 30 days from the actual release date. Any amendments or other information relative to the solicitations will be posted to this website (www.fedbizopps.gov). As such, interested sources are encouraged to REGISTER TO RECEIVE NOTIFICATION. If you have any questions concerning the solicitations, please submit those in writing to Tonya Saunders via e-mail at tonya.saunders@ssa.gov. Telephone calls WILL NOT be accepted or returned.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to a solicitation to obtain the services of experienced, licensed Medical Experts in the field of  Medical Oncology, who are board certified and/or have SSA disability program experience at the State and/or Federal level, or in the absence of board certification, have SSA disability program experience combined with specialized training, to serve as Medical Experts to analyze and provide expert advice related to their specialized field, as needed, so that adjudicators can render accurate determinations and decisions. 

**SSA has designated these solicitations for TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE participation only** 

BACKGROUND: SSA is responsible for two national disability programs, Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). SSA uses a five-step sequential process for evaluating the disability claim submitted by an individual who alleges an inability to perform substantial gainful activity (SGA). The program defines disability as an inability to engage in SGA by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death, or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. A medical basis for the disability claim is required, and the State disability determination services (DDS) collect and evaluate the medical information, making a determination about the severity of the medical impairment as it relates to the claimants ability to perform SGA. 

While medical generalist may properly evaluate many disability impairments, claims that involve difficult or complex issues require medical specialist and sub-specialist expertise.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

GO TO THE FOLLOWING WEB SITE UNDER BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES TO VIEW THE ENTIRE BAA SOLICITATION FOR FULL DETAILS:  https://www3.natick.army.mil The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center  Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) identifies scientific and technical areas of interest for research and/or exploratory development.  This BAA is conducted using full and open competition.  In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA utilizes a two-step process. The first step will be the submission of a concept paper. Offerors that submit concept papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two). Such an invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Instructions for the submission of concept papers and proposals are contained in the BAA. The submission of a concept paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal.  Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA.  Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process.  A proposal's technical evaluation, and its importance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award.  Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate.  Concept papers will be accepted continuously through 28 February 2011.  This BAA will remain open continuously through 31 March 2011. The BAA technical areas of interest are divided into the following groups:  1. Combat Feeding Equipment and Systems (objectives focus on combat food service equipment for individual and group feeding, and unit/organization equipment); 2. Combat Ration Research and Development; 3. Warrior Systems Technologies (objectives focus on ballistic protection for individuals, integrated protective helmet, modular personnel protection system (MPPS), chemical/biological protection for individuals, flame and thermal protection for the individual soldier, countersurveillance, body worn interactive materials, body-worn systems, hand held devices, and smart-lightweight electronic components/modules for soldier protection, knowledge management and cognitive improvement, biomechanics, materials nanotechnology, lightweight conformal solar cells, anthropometry, advanced protection and integration technologies and systems, warrior performance and soldier-borne power source); 4. Tentage, Fabric Structures and Rigid Wall Shelters; 5. Airdrop - Advanced Personnel and Cargo Airdrop Systems; 6. Textile Technologies; 7. Modeling and Simulation (objectives focus on individual and small unit performance and survivability, and wargaming concept and tool development); 8. Neuroepidemiology; 9.

<DESC><p>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. This notice is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Responses to this notice are strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporation's ability to submit an offer if and when a solicitation is released. The requested information is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. No entitlement of payment by the government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractor's information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.<br />Introduction: This is a updated Sources Sought Synopsis for an Operational Aviation Training Unit that was posted to the FedBIzOpps on 11 Sep 08 and later amended on 30 Sep 08 under Solicitation 311HSWPKAH11Sep08. In that posting, the government requested information from vendors for an "operational" aviation training unit in the Dayton area during fiscal year 2010 but no later than 2011. The United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) currently located at Brooks City-Base, Texas, trains 100% of the USAF's flight surgeons, Aerospace Medicine Specialists, and Aerospace Physiologists. Relocation of this mission to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio in FY2011 will enhance integration of the science, research and academic mission of USAFSAM, but will separate the organization from all likely sources of basic aviation training support. <br />Background:<br />Residents in Aerospace Medicine and Aerospace Physiologists currently receive their aviation training in the San Antonio area (Randolph AFB and/or Laughlin AFB). Current flying training for basic Aerospace Medicine Primary students is insufficient and "space available" only. No opportunity for basic or advanced flight familiarization training for Flight Surgeons, Residents in Aerospace Medicine, or Aerospace Physiologists will be available at Wright-Patterson, AFB. The students will have to travel to other locations within the U.S. to receive their training. Not only is this costly it is not consistently available. <br />Descriptions of Services:<br />The government seeks a vendor to provide an "operational" aviation training unit. This unit is to be initially established within a 50 mile radius of Brooks City Base, Texas area in FY 2009 but will move to the Dayton, Ohio area during fiscal year 2011. Period of Performance will be for a period of no less than 4 years. The vendor will offer curriculum-based aviation training in the San Antonio, Texas area and then relocate the training to the Wright-Patterson AFB area. Training will be for Aerospace Medicine Residents, Aerospace Physiology students, and related staff, and include "ground school" and flight-related academic lectures in a group setting, and provide a dedicated flying training unit that will permit student control with an instructor in all phases of flight. The flying demonstration and proficiency curriculum will be specifically designed to expose flight surgeon students, aerospace medicine residents, and aerospace physiology trainees to the rigors of flying, mission planning, modern cockpit symbology, disorientation, instrument techniques, aerobatic and formation flight. <br />Minimum aircraft requirements are: <br />Tri-cycle gear, two-seats side-by-side, dual stick controls, acrobatic capability (+6G to -3G), day/night/IFR capable, "glass cockpit". The curriculum would include spatial disorientation familiarization training, instrument training, acrobatics and formation flight with an emphasis on human factors and disorientation awareness events. It is estimated that once fully implemented there will be a yearly requirement for as many as 5,900 flight hours to meet USAFSAM's flight training requirements. <br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. You may contact Mr. Juan Villarreal at the telephone number and email provided herein.<br />DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: The Information package should include the following items:<br />1. A brief description of your company's business size and business status (ie. small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned, HUBzone, service disabled veteran owned small business, and HBCU/MI); <br />2. Do you qualify under the 8(a) program? If you are a small business, do you also qualify under any of the sub-categories (small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business, HUBzone small business, service disabled veteran-owned small business or veteran-owned small business)?<br />3. Would you be interested in submitting a proposal considering the anticipated scope of work? If not, why?<br />4. Do you have sufficient experience in the anticipated scope that would allow the evaluator to assess your capability? If not, please explain.<br />5. Under an Indefinite Delivery contract (FAR 16.5), what is the minimum and maximum dollar value project on which your firm would routinely consider submitting a proposal?<br />6. Are you aware of any DoD contracts dealing with commercial services for a "operational" aviation training unit? If so, provide the following: government POC, organization, phone number, email address, and contract number.<br />7. Description of your capabilities and ability to provide the efforts described for these services.<br />8. Rough order magnitude (ROM) for providing efforts described for these services.<br />9. Please provide response as to what anticipated applicable NAICS code you would utilize for this effort. We anticipate the NAICS to be 611512 - Flight Training.<br />10. Do you see any issues/problems with the identified service?<br />11. Any additional comments /recommendations to achieve requirements described above.<br />12. What would be sufficient time to put together your proposal?
<p>ALL INTERESTED RESPONDENTS PLEASE ENSURE ALL ANSWERS ARE COMPLETE.</p>
<p>1. This request does not constitute an Invitation For Bid or a Request For Proposal. Request for proposals, if and when issued, will be available on FedBizOpps.gov.

<DESC>This serves as a sources sought notice and market survey to locate qualified small businesses capable of performing a variety of specialized studies for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).  FSIS is responsible for the inspection of meat, poultry, and egg products to ensure that they are safe, wholesome, unadulterated, and properly labeled and packed.  Recently, the food commodity of catfish has been added to the list of foods that are within the agencys responsibility of inspection.  Periodically, FSIS collects samples of meat and poultry products to estimate the national prevalence and levels of bacteria of public health concern, commonly referred to as a baseline study.  It has been determined that the agency needs to collect microbiological data regarding the presence and levels of various bacteria in order to determine a baseline for these microbes.  In addition, because some of the bacteria to be tested are not part of the usual microbiological testing regiment and because the sample type is new to the agency, it is necessary to develop new methods of sample preparation and sample analysis to be used for this baseline and by the agency during its regulatory efforts to examine catfish.  The expected sample types are pieces of catfish (fresh, smoked, or frozen filets, whole fish, etc), or rinsates of catfish obtained in the field and shipped to the laboratory.  In addition, the testing of environmental samples (catfish pond water and sediment, water used in the preparation of the fish) are included within this scope.  While it is expected that the fish type to be tested will primarily be catfish, there is the possibility that fish mislabeled as catfish will be submitted for testing, therefore all samples submitted to the laboratory are to be tested.

The Contractors laboratory will perform detection and enumeration of all aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.  However, the agency has special interest in the following bacteria:  

Pathogens:  Non-Typhi Salmonella sp., Vibrio sp. (including Vibrio cholera), Gas-forming anaerobes (including Clostridium botulinum that produce toxin E), and Escherichia coli O157:H7.

Indicators of sanitation:  generic E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, and total aerobic plate count (APC).  

Small businesses having the capabilities necessary to provide the described services are invited to submit appropriate documentation to demonstrate the ability to perform this service.  This information will allow the Government to determine whether small business concerns can satisfy the Governments requirement and whether the procurement should be set-aside for small businesses.  The applicable North American Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541380, Testing Laboratories, and the small business size standard is $12 million in average annual receipts.

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a solicitation and no solicitation package exists at this time.  The Government is not requesting technical/management proposals and no contract will be awarded as a result of this sources sought notice.  Your responses will be used solely for market research purposes of the Government.  The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this synopsis and submittals will not be returned to the sender.  If a solicitation is later released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any synopsis or solicitation.

Interested small businesses are requested to submit a package delineating qualification, capabilities, and experience for meeting the range of services described herein.  Include information on your companys managerial and technical resources to be able to meet the requirements.  Companies must sufficiently demonstrate the capability to perform this service and must provide detailed experience and qualifications in all previous work pertinent to this effort.  Responses should also include the following:  name and address of firm; size of business; number of years in business; and list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact with address and phone number).

Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  Responses may be submitted by e-mail to Crandall.Watson@fsis.usda.gov at USDA, FSIS, ASD, 5601 Sunnyside Ave., Maildrop 5230, Beltsville, MD 20705-5230; or by fax at (301) 504-4276.

<DESC>1. BackgroundThe NASA Aviation Safety Program is hereby soliciting information on Verification andValidation (V&V) challenges for the next generation of flight-critical systems.  Whilethe current aviation system has an enviable safety record, advances in technology areplacing an increasing strain on our ability to assure the integrity of new andanticipated systems.  Additionally, there is a perception that current approaches for theassurance of complex flight-critical systems impose a barrier to innovation.  Thus, weare soliciting input on innovative approaches, technologies and processes to addressthese concerns.  The specific focus is on flight-critical systems, i.e., systemscomprising hardware, software and physical systems, used to execute pre-defined conceptsof operation or operating procedures, and interacting with human operators includingpilots and controllers, that will directly control some aspect of flight and thus must bedemonstrated to the highest levels of safety.  This focus is to support the NextGeneration Air Transportation System (NextGen  see http://www.jpdo.gov/nextgen.asp    ), targeting NextGen safety activities and interests encompassing vehicles, vehiclesystems, airspace, airspace concept of operations, and air traffic technologies such ascommunication or guidance and navigation.The NASA Aviation Safety Program is responsible for mid- to long-term research to improvecivilian aviation safety.  This request for information is targeting research advancesrequired to create the theory, methods and tools to support future methods of V & V. Innovative and transformative methods are particularly of interest; while they shouldsupport all stages of system life-cycle (including design, test and evaluation,production and subsequent maintenance and modification decisions), they do not need to beconstrained by current certification methods.2. DescriptionUnder this RFI, the NASA Aviation Safety Program solicits insight into V & V obstacles totimely and cost-effective implementation of flight-critical systems.  At this time, theNASA Aviation Safety Program will use any information provided for the purpose ofconsidering a focused research effort in this area and will publish a review of the stateof the art which could include a summary of the collected responses from thissolicitation.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to beconstrued as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for informationsolicited. Additionally, the NASA Aviation Safety Program solicits insight into innovative theories,methods and tools for V & V of Flight-Critical Systems at all levels of development.  Wewelcome articulation of all obstacles to their implementation, including furthertechnical developments required, changes they imply in current processes for design, testand evaluation, regulatory compliance and other implementation considerations, and otherimplications such as policy concerns.For this RFI, the NASA Aviation Safety Program created the following three broadcategories for purposes of organizing possible research and objectives.  Suggestions foralternate organizations of the research areas, and descriptions of V & V issues not notedin the three topics below, are also welcomed.Topic 1.	Modeling and Validation of New Concepts for Vehicles and Operations:Current safety assessments of new concepts for vehicles and operations need to beextended to better address transformative changes that are not covered by extendingcurrent V & V methods.	In addition, there is a need to predict key blocks to humanperformance and to provide rigorous design guidance early-and-throughout development ofthese concepts.  The objective is to develop safety-case methods and supportingtechnologies, such as methods for modeling concepts of operation to identify safetyissues, capable of analyzing the system-wide safety properties suitable for civilaviation vehicles and for complex concepts of operation involving airborne systems,ground systems, human operators and controllers.Topic 2.	Verification of Complex Integrated and Distributed Systems: Theintegration of functions across traditional boundaries (e.g., integration of discrete andcontinuous behaviors, integration of distributed vehicle (and ground-vehicle) functions,novel distributions of functions between air and ground and between human and automation)demands new methods for predicting, assuring and proving the safety levels demanded ofNextGen.  The objective is to develop a collection of technologies and mathematicalmodels that enable rigorous, comprehensive analysis of new integrated (and distributed)systems interacting through various structures such communication networks andhuman-automation and human-human interaction.  Topic 3.	Software Safety Assurance: Establishing sufficient confidence in thesafety of complex software-intensive systems, such as those envisioned for NextGen, is asignificant challenge.	While this problem has been widely recognized, it is generallyviewed as incremental changes to a current process that is cost-prohibitive andautomatically precludes a wide range of functions and capabilities; thus, atransformative view of software safety assurance is needed.  The objective is to developtechniques, tools, and policies to enable efficient and accurate analysis of safetyaspects of software-intensive systems; ultimately reducing the cost of software V & V tothe point where it no longer obstructs many safety innovations and NextGen developments,and ultimately enable in-the-field assurance of composed software-intensive systems. 3. Process The NASA Aviation Safety Program, based at NASA Headquarters in Washington DC, overseesprogram research conducted largely at four NASA field centers (Ames Research Center,Dryden Flight Research Center, Glenn Research Center, and Langley Research Center), andat a variety of partners facilities. In Fiscal Year 2009 a four-step process will beused to define a research effort in V & V of Flight Critical Systems within the AviationSafety Program: Step 1: Assess the long-term research needs and goals in the aviation community for V & Vof flight-critical systems and establish technical roadmaps to accomplish those goals. Indeveloping those roadmaps, prioritize according to NASAs unique strengths andcapabilities. Establish a multi-center, multidisciplinary planning team. Step 2: Solicit information through this RFI on the key areas of interest from theexternal community. Step 3: Develop a research plan and establish NASA research teams. The responses to thisRFI will provide important source material to the NASA research teams. Step 4: Identify key partnerships with other federal agencies, international agenciescoordinating aviation safety, industry, not-for-profit research groups and academia.  Anumber of partnerships may be considered, including research conducted by NASA on areimbursable basis, non-reimbursable inter-agency or space act agreements, and directsponsorship of research through competitively-selected on-site and off-site contractingmechanisms and cooperative agreements.	Note that NASA, at the time of issuing this RFI,has not committed to any of these mechanisms.4. Information for Respondents 4.1 How to Respond Respondents are requested to submit a white paper of ten (10) pages maximum, with minimum12-point Times font. All white papers shall include the company or institute name,point-of-contact, address, phone number and email.  These responses may includereferences to material available in the public literature; NASAs consideration of thesereferences will be aided by the respondent discussing the importance of and uniquecapabilities described by any cited material.Please submit all responses in electronic format to the Point-of-Contact listed below byNOON Eastern Standard Time, April 24, 2009: Name: Dawn McIntosh Title: Associate Technical Integration Manager, Aviation Safety Program Email: hq-vnv-rfi@mail.nasa.govQuestions regarding this RFI should also be emailed to the above Point-of-Contact. 4.2 Proprietary or Confidential InformationSince provided information will be incorporated into a larger state of the art reviewthat will be published by NASA, respondents are NOT to provide any information that isconsidered proprietary, trade secrets, privileged, or confidential. Any response thatincludes data or information with markings indicating that the data or information isnon-public, proprietary or may not be republished will be considered non-responsive andwill be returned.

Requirement:

The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Winton, NC that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 1172 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 977 contiguous ANSI/BOMA office area square feet (OASF).  The lease term requirement is for Five (5) years.  The space must be available for occupancy by December 1, 2009.  The delineated area is:

The entire city limits of Winton, NC.

Other applicable requirements include:

Study of Concrete Tie Performance on the Northeast Corridor:
Track/Train Forces, Tie Design, and Material Properties

The Federal Railroad Administration has a requirement to conduct a study of concrete tie performance in the Northeast Corridor (NEC) between Washington and Boston, where train operating speeds are at or above 125 mph.  Minimum capabilities to perform this work requires detailed knowledge and actual experience with the various forces imparted to the track structure by the Acela trainsets.  As the NEC is the only location in the U. S. where trains operate at or above 125 mph, and as the Acela trainset design is unique among high speed trains operating anywhere in the world, FRA intends to award a contract through limited competition among the only organizations known to have the required knowledge and actual experience in analyzing the track/train forces from these trainsets. The three organizations are:  LTK Engineering Services, ENSCO, and TTCI.  Other potential offerors having detailed knowledge and actual experience with the forces imparted to the track structure by the Acela trainsets in the North East Corridor may contact the above person (Donald Plotkin) for additional information.

Project Title:  Availability of National Level Poisoning Data in the United States for the Identification and Understanding of Adverse Drug Reactions, and Medication Errors Associated with Therapeutic Products 

Background 

A vital part of FDA and CDERs mission is to protect the public health. The Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (OSE) contributes to this effort by evaluating the safety of marketed drugs and biologic products and promoting their safe use by the American people.  Two major reports, the Institute of Medicines (IOM) Future of Drug Safety and the GAO report Improvement needed in FDAs Decision Making Oversight Process have emphasized the need for more tools, resources, staff and authority to the FDA to improve drug safety. In response to these reports, FDA has devoted greater resources to the area of post marketing safety and has expanded the roles and responsibilities of OSE within CDER. 
The passage of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA, September 27, 2007)) has greatly increased the responsibilities of FDA, provided FDA with new authorities, and reauthorized several FDA critical programs. The act, primarily Title IX, also provides FDA with additional requirements, authorities, and resources with regard to both pre- and postmarket drug safety. The statute contains important new authorities to require postmarket studies and clinical trials, safety labeling changes, and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS). The act requires increased activities for active post market risk identification and analysis particularly those related to tools and methods for data access and analysis. 

FDA currently has several tools and data resources available to address post marketing safety issues. These include a passive surveillance system for medication errors and adverse events related to drug therapy; several drug utilization databases; and access to automated healthcare data of various types for pharmacoepidemiology studies. Passive reporting systems are limited by underreporting, attribution problems, reporting biases, and a lack of denominator information. To strengthen and complement these resources, FDA is soliciting responses from national organizations which collect and expeditiously provide national level data on human poisonings associated with drug products in the United States. 

In the past the FDA has used published national level data on poisonings available in the public domain to help assess the safety of drugs in the postmarketing phase of their lifecycle.  The FDA has used these data in a number of reviews and/or presented these data at important public advisory committee meetings which included discussions of 1) the public health importance of acetaminophen-related poisonings, 2) over-the-counter cough and cold product-related poisonings in children less than 6 years of age, and 3) propoxyphene-related poisonings.  However, the published reports of national level data on poisonings that are available in the public domain have limited or no information that permits comprehensive root cause analyses; additionally, they cannot be customized to preferred age categories.

Purpose

The purpose of this RFI is to identify an organization(s) which collects and has direct access to national level data on poisonings. Such data have the potential to provide the Agency with more complete information about poisonings and overdoses and provide the context required to best analyze poisoning and overdose-associated variables including adverse drug reactions, medication errors, major clinical effects, and outcomes, including deaths, associated with commonly used therapeutic products.  FDA must have timely access to detailed national level data to enable root cause analyses of poisonings and overdose cases.  Through this RFI, FDA is seeking responses to the Research Criteria (below) to determine the feasibility and utility of obtaining poisoning/overdose data from a national resource.

Description of Services

In general, FDA is interested in: 

1) National level data systems with data on human poisonings associated with drug products that can provide the following desirable minimum data elements:

a) Gender and customized age ranges such as 0-5 years; 6-11 years; 12-17; 18-64, >65. 
b) geographic region 
c)  generic and trade name of products involved 
d)  availability of multiple years of data 
e) adverse outcomes including deaths 

2) National level systems or data resources that have the capability to provide information on the following safety areas such as, 

a) abuse or misuse of prescription and over-the counter drugs that have serious public health consequences 

b) drug-related medication errors

c) drug-related deaths and major clinical effects and outcomes 

	3) National level systems or data resources that have direct access to the detailed data themselves and the capability to provide specified customized reports to FDA.

Research Criteria

In general, FDA is interested in organizations that have direct access to multiple years of national level data on human poisonings/overdoses/medication errors and associated outcomes and have the capability to provide the following:

	1) Provide abstract record information about cases of poisonings/overdoses with certain drugs that resulted in deaths.  
	
	2)  Provide the reasons for exposures (unintentional or intentional) for specified drugs that resulted in a major adverse effect with description of the effect.

	3) Provide an analysis of medication errors involving specified drugs with reasons for administration and errors and details about any adverse outcomes.  

	4) Provide information on specific proprietary names (brand) of prescription or over-the-counter medications in which the wrong medication was administered and the root cause of such errors. 

Interested organizations are invited to submit a description of their capabilities for providing this type of information. Submitted information shall include a discussion addressing research criteria, described in a concise review of drug-related and medication error related poisoning systems. 

Cost Estimates

All submissions shall contain cost estimates for FDA to obtain customized data reports on unintentional/intentional poisoning or medication errors.
Responses

Responses are preferred in electronic format (word or PDF).  Responses shall provide their business size status (large, small business, 8(a), HUBZone, Small Disabled Veteran owned Business, Women-owned Small Business, etc.)  The information above shall also include the following:

Submitters Name
Street Address, City, State, Zip code
Point of Contact (POC), 
POC Telephone and facsimile numbers
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 

All information submitted to the FDA will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law.  All information submitted will be reviewed; however, FDA will not acknowledge or respond to any submissions.  Information must be submitted not later than 4:30 PM Eastern Standard time on April 7, 2009  and e-mailed to the attention of Patricia Wright, Contract Specialist at patricia.wright@fda.hhs.gov .  Telephone calls will not be accepted.

Scintillator crystals are used in gamma spectroscopy to convert the gamma rays to light for analysis. These crystals are used in many different industries, such as homeland security and health care, and for various applications such as radiation detectors. These applications have continued to require scintillators with greater energy resolution, higher light yield, fast scintillation decay time, and higher effective atomic number. Ease of crystallization and robustness of the crystals during use are also important properties. Sodium iodide (NaI) scintillators have been used most widely in all applications due to its ease of growth. Bismuth germanate (BGO) is used in medical imaging applications (PET scanners) because of its high Z number and density, although both have poor energy resolution and light yield.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders. Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form). A local order will also be issued for termination or changes to services. Services provided without a local order are not contractually covered. Services may be ordered only as shown on the CSA Schedule B. Orders must be signed by the Communications Systems Officer or designee.<br />(y) Posting Award Documents. Per FAR 5.303 and FAR 15.503(b), local announcements of contract awards, including Schedule Bs, are posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) at https://www.fbo.gov/. Do not include any proprietary markings within Proposal Schedule B's. Such markings shall eliminate vendors from being considered for award. <br />(End of Addendum to Clause 52.212-4)</p>

All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>

The following paragraph(s) of 52-212-4 are amended as indicated below:
1. Paragraph(m), Termination for Cause.
Delete paragraph(m) in its entirety and substitute the following: (m) Termination for Cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If this contract is terminated in whole or in part for cause, and the supplies or services covered by the contract so terminated are repurchased
by the Government, the Government will incur administrative costs in such repurchases. The Contractor and the Government expressly agree that, in
addition to any excess costs of repurchase, or any other damages resulting
from such default, the Contractor shall pay, and the Government shall accept, the sum of $1155.00 as payment in full for the administrative costs of such repurchase. This assessment of damages for administrative costs shall apply for any termination for cause following which the Government repurchases the terminated supplies or services together with any incidental or consequential damages incurred because of the termination. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.

"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) Number" means the DUNS number assigned by D & B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a

<p>Statement of Work (SOW)<br />MCC Emergency Workforce Notification Service<br />1.0 Introduction</p>
<p>The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is a Federal Corporation created under Title VI of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2004.

<p>7.0 Quotation Evaluation<br /><br />7.1 Clause FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in descending order of importance:</p>
<p>(1) Technical Capability<br />&bull; Web-service capability/functionality<br />&bull; Web-service reliability, safeguards, control points<br />&bull; Customer Service Support<br />&bull; Compliance with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), Federal Telecommunication Standards (FED-STDS), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 requirements.<br />(2) Past Performance<br />&bull; Similar notification web-service provided to other federal entities.<br />(3) Price<br />&bull; Contractor's ability to provide web-service experience at the price proposed and current market conditions. <br />(4) The Government will use the following adjectival rating for the technical proposals:</p>
<p><br />Exceptional Offeror's proposal exceeds requirements and demonstrates an exceptional understanding of goals and objectives of the acquisition. One or more major strengths exist. No significant weaknesses or deficiencies exist.<br />Acceptable Offeror's proposal demonstrates an acceptable understanding of goals and objectives of the acquisition. There may be strengths and weaknesses. Strengths outbalance any weaknesses that exist and there are no deficiencies.<br />Marginal Offeror's proposal demonstrates a marginal understanding of the goals and objectives of the acquisition. Weaknesses have been found that outbalance any strengths that exist. Weaknesses will be difficult to correct. Deficiencies must be corrected prior to award.<br />Unacceptable Offeror's proposal demonstrates an unacceptable understanding of the goals and objectives of the acquisition. The proposal has one or more significant weaknesses or deficiencies that will be very difficult to correct, or are not correctable.</p>
<p>(5)Past performance shall be evaluated with respect to an offeror's probability of successfully completing the solicitation requirements based on the offeror's performance on similar contract efforts.</p>
<p>If the Offeror has no relevant corporate or organizational past performance, the Offeror may provide past performance on an Offeror's proposed key personnel who have relevant experience. An Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, will receive a neutral rating on past performance.</p>
<p>Offerors are cautioned that the Government will use data provided by each Offeror and data obtained from other sources in the evaluation of past and present performance.</p>
<p>The Past performance references should be included as a separate section in the Technical proposal and should include the following: contract Number, contract dollar value, period of performance, description of services, and name of agency or company point of contact for contract to include name, telephone number and email address. The Offeror shall provide completed work assignments during the last three years similar in nature, or directly related to the requirements of the statement of work.</p>
<p>Past Performance - Adjectival Ratings: The Government will use the following ratings: High Risk, Medium Risk, Low Risk, and Unknown Risk<br />High Risk Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.<br />Medium Risk Can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increased cost, or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.<br />Low Risk Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.<br />Unknown Risk No relevant performance record is identifiable upon which to base a meaningful performance risk prediction. A search was unable to identify any relevant past performance information for the Offeror or key team members/subcontractors or their key personnel. This is neither a negative or positive assessment.</p>
<p><br />8.0 Quotations Submission Requirements <br />Provide sufficient information for the evaluation to be conducted as described in the above Statement of Work. Page limit - 8. Provide your proposed firm fixed price for one base year with 3 one year priced options to provide the service described in the Statement of Work. Be explicit and explain the pricing proposed. Please note, any travel incurred for transportation and per diem (lodging, meals and incidental expenses) is not reimbursable by MCC. Volume 1. Technical Proposal: One (1) original and 3 additional paper copies, One (1) CD or electronic copy. Volume 2: Price Proposal: One (1) Original and 3 additional paper copies, One (1) CD or electronic copy. This is a best value procurement. Offerors are cautioned that failure to provide all the required information may make the offer non-responsive and may result in elimination of the Offeror from further consideration for award. Also, Offerors are cautioned of the possibility that award may be made without discussion of the proposal received; therefore, the initial offer should be submitted on the most favorable terms from a price and technical standpoint which the Offeror can submit to the Government. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed, or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration is issuing this combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5 ?V Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

If the Government chooses this alternative, the awards will be for the CLINs or combination of CLINs that result in the lowest aggregate cost to the Government, including the assumed administrative cost. For the purposes of this procurement, there would, at most, be two awards broken down as follows: Lee??s Summit, MO, CLIN 0001 through CLIN 0005 and Lenexa, KS, CLIN 0006 through CLIN 0010.

<DESC>The Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center (CRTC), Alpena, MI 49707-8125 herby formally announces the intent to award a firm-fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to Systems Atlanta, Inc (SAI). This is an upgrade and replacement of equipment that has met the end of its projected life cycle. The equipment and software required are (1) SAIs Information Display/Dissemination System (IDS5) software on a pre-configured workstation hardware platform (Air Force nomenclature is Airfield Automation System (AFAS); (2) SAIs IDS5 interface software for the Starcaster Digital Automated Terminal Information Service (D-ATIS); ELO touch Monitors (19) and associated supported. The total solution is required at the Alpena CRTC control tower and Radar Approach Control (RAPCON).<BR><BR>The proposed contract action is for Non-Developmental, commercially available equipment/software with incidental installation services for which the Air Force intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. This acquisition is a follow-on effort to Purchase Order DAHA20-03-P-9007 for the original purchase of the IDS5 system. The IDS5 systems capabilities include the ability to reduce controller workload by consolidating multiple segregated displays and control systems into one single focal point for data access, a key feature of the IDS5 is the ability to directly interface with AF weather equipment and display critical weather information used by ATC to formulate manual broadcasters of weather information to aviators using legacy ATIS equipment. The task of manually formulating and broadcasting ATIS messages becomes especially demanding during inclement or rapidly changing weather conditions since ATC must always ensure the most current weather information is continuously and accurately relayed to pilots. This system also seeks to further reduce ATCs workload while simultaneously enhancing flight safety by automating ATIS message broadcasts through purchase and installation of SAIs IDS5 Starcaster ATIS interface software, in conjunction with purchase and installation of the Starcaster D-ATIS and associated  peripherals on a common IDS5 workstation hardware platform, which is the only method for achieving the desired level of automation due to SAIs proprietary design of both IDS5 and the IDS5 Starcaster ATIS interface software. Acquisition of touch monitors to replace previously installed display monitors used with IDS5 will complete this system upgrade and replacement. Providing touch screen monitors is to replace current touch screen monitors used by the ATC staff. Questions may be directed by E-Mail. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(4) * Have, *have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3692.

Closing Date and time for receipt of offers is 15 April 2009, 2:00P.M., Eastern Standard Time. Electronic mail offers are acceptable and may be forwarded to jean-claude.amisial@uscg.mil. 

All questions must be submitted in writing to Jean-Claude Amisial via e-mail at jean-claude.amisial@uscg.mil or via fax 410-762-6008.

Questions must be received NLT 12:00PM EST ON 09 April 2009.  POC is Jean-Claude Amisial, USCG Contracts Specialist, 410-762-6582.

<DESC><p>The following are questions that arose&nbsp;during the site visit on 23 March 2009 along with the answers:</p>
<p>1. Can any of the existing electrical disconnect boxes be relocated or deleted?</p>
<p>ANS. The disconnect labeled "Breaker Box for The Circulation Pump" has power running to it however it is no longer connected to a load so it can be removed along with the feed running to it.<br /><br />ANS. The disconnect labeled for the Vibration System is located just north of the Circulation Pump Disconnect. This disconnect is in use but it will be moved approximately 6 ft north along the west wall and reinstalled there.</p>
<p>ANS. The disconnect which powered the chiller and is now the source of power for the blower/sucker fan will require reinstallation to the north approximately 8 feet.</p>
<p>2. If the large air duct can be relocated?</p>
<p>ANS. The large air duct can be relocated to the north and reconnected to the blower/sucker fan in its present location provided C.E. grants permission for the additional penetration of the wall and the old vacant hole is properly sealed to their standards.</p>
<p><br />3. Can the chilled water lines be relocated to the south wall?</p>
<p>ANS. In room 119 the chill water lines can be located to the south wall if they are then run north into the trench as they provide cooling for the shaker and the environmental chamber via their path through the trench.</p>
<p><br />4. Will there be a requirement for any pass-thru conduit to the outside?</p>
<p>ANS. I see the possible necessity for two conduits. One would be for transducer wiring from the accumulator tank, air duct, and vacuum pumps to the control system located in room 119. The other would be for a compressed air line if the design calls for pneumatic actuators to be used on the system.</p>
<p><br />5. Can we either come out and take some photo's or if Mr. Fleenor has already taken some can he send them to us?</p>
<p>ANS.I have provided the photos which I took and annotated to Michelle Syth. She will make copies available in accordance with their procedures. If she or her supervisors have no objections I am agreeable to someone coming to take additional photos, measurements, or asking questions whenever I am present.</p>
<p>**The photos are posted as an attachment to this notice**</p>

<DESC>THIS PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO CANCEL THIS SOLICITATION. (i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

(iii)  This combined synopsis/solicitation will result in a firm fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity commercial supply reagent rental/lease to own contract.  (iv) This combined synopsis/solicitation Request for Quote is being issued as a full and open competition.  (v)  This requirement is for The United States Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Medical Center Microbiology/Molecular laboratory which requires a Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Genotyping system using Analyte Specific Reagents (ASR) to conduct HCV genotype testing. Hepatitis C virus infection is relatively prevalent amongst the US veteran population and is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Determination of viral load and viral genotype (there are 6 main HCV genotypes) are routinely used laboratory guides to clinical management. Our laboratory performs viral load determination and genotyping assays in-house and serves as a reference lab to the VA system. Existing genotyping methodologies require prior PCR amplification of viral nucleic acid, which is most commonly and most efficiently, accomplished using the very same PCR reaction that is also used for viral load determination in the performing laboratory.  We have performed HCV genotyping for many years, however, the current procedure uses components that are classified as RUO (Research Only Use) by the US FDA. We have to change the methodology for a variety reasons, one of which is we cannot continue the RUO methodology without greatly increased cost and complexity, since the current methodology does not work off of the PCR products of our newly implemented Roche HCV viral load assay. (vi) REQUIREMENT AND QUANTITIES: The genotyping estimated annual volume is 230 tests.This requirement consists of one (1) line item to perform the services described in this solicitation.

Yes, He could park at the loading dock which is close to the mailroom.

11.  How soon do you expect to award this?   As soon as 17 April 2009.

12.  How many trips per day are required? - There will be one multi-stop trip per day guaranteed.  Anything over that may happen 20 to 30 times a year on an adhoc basis where we would give 90 minutes notice as described in the SOW.

14.   Does my company need to have a surety bond for this? If so how much?  We never required a surety bond in the past.

<DESC>RECOVERY: Digital Television (DTV) Transition, Basic In-Home Installation Assistance for Southwest Region (AR, LA, NM, OK, PR and TX).  This amendment adds Puerto Rico to the states listed in the Southwest Region solicitation.  All other requirements remain unchanged.

PAPER COPIES OF THIS SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND TELEPHONE REQUEST OR FAX REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12 and FAR Subpart 13.5 simplified acquisition procedures. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov). North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) 811211 and Size Standard of $7 Million apply to this solicitation. 

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is in the final stage of implementing the congressionally mandated nationwide transition to digital broadcast television.  Approximately one-third of the Nations 1800 full-power television stations have already completed this transition.  The remaining two-thirds of full-power broadcast television stations will transition on or before June 12, 2009.

In the television markets where the digital television (DTV) transition has been completed, the FCC has learned that most individuals and households can successfully make the transition by following instructions provided with their digital-to-analog converter box or by accessing mass media materials (such as information found on the FCCs and other entities Internet sites, fact sheets and other printed materials available in libraries and community centers, calls to FCC or broadcast station help lines, or informational/demonstration programs presented by FCC staff, local television stations, and community groups).

This request for quotation (RFQ) seeks proposals for basic, in-home digital-to-analog converter box installation services.  Such services are composed of the following elements: connecting up to two of a households existing coupon-eligible digital-to-analog converter boxes to existing broadcast antenna(s) and analog TVs, providing a basic level of orienting/reorienting the households antenna(s) and scanning/rescanning the converter box(es) in order to receive digital broadcast TV stations in the area, and providing basic guidance to the consumer on the operation of their converter box(es). Statistical evidence suggests that certain geographical areas of the country are less prepared than others.  Thus, this solicitation also prefers proposals targeted to the geographical communities identified in the attached statement of work and is seeking proposals that focus on providing digital transition assistance to low-income individuals, minority communities, non-English speaking consumers, senior citizens, consumers living in rural areas or on tribal lands, and consumers with disabilities.   

Proposals are requested from all potential offerors, regardless of whether they qualify as small business concerns or Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business concerns under Small Business Administration regulations, 13 C.F.R. Parts 121 and 126. However, the FCC will make awards using cascading HUBZone and small business set-asides, as described in Method for Award-Cascading Set Asides, before considering awards to offerors other than small businesses. METHOD FOR AWARDCASCADING SET-ASIDES Multiple awards will be made resulting from this solicitation using the following cascading set-aside order of preference: (1) In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.13, awards will be made on a competitive basis first to responsible, certified HUBZone small business concerns. (2) Following step (1), additional awards will be made on a competitive basis in accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5 to responsible, eligible small business concerns.

<DESC>Q79: Does the USCG have engine cart to move the T700 and CTF engines in and out of the Shaft Cell? If no would you like a quote for this equipment?

A79: Yes, the CG has one.  No quote needed.

Q80: Per a previous answer to the regarding the water drain, A58: The water system should be a closed loop system to re-circulate water from a dynamometer back to the cooling system. The facility currently has a drain system that feeds back to the oily-water separator. Question: based on the drawings it looks like the drain system feeds back to the sump in the water tower  please verify if this is incorrect.

A80:  Incorrect, the answer given to A58 is correct in its wording.

Q81: Is the length of the augmentor section in the test cell fixed at 4'1" or does this telescope in and out? If so, what is the shortest length when it is fully contracted?

A81: The exhaust tube does not telescope out, it is fixed.  

Q82: The February 10, 2009 synopsis specifies FAR 42.212-5 are applicable.  Paragraph (b) of that FAR requires the Contractor to comply with the clauses that the Contracting Officer has indicated as being incorporated.  The FAR further stipulates [Contracting Officer to check as appropriate.] clauses to be incorporated.  Since none of the clauses have been checked, can we assume that none of the clauses apply?

A82:  No, see response to Q78.  The CG typically lists the clauses this way in a synopsis.  If a Statement of Work had been issued the entire clause would have been included.

Q83: We have been trying to obtain the AFT3 Jet Test Cell Publications as listed on page 3 of the Statement of Objectives (Sec 3.0): 2J-ATF3-10, -2-1, -2-2, -2-3, -4 and TI-8084H.  Answer 18 provided on March 18th listed Honeywell Technical Operations Center, 1-800-601-3099 as the source.   We have been in contact with Honeywell through numerous phone conversations and have now been told definitively that the ATF3 publications listed (above) in the SOO are not cataloged, maintained or available by Honeywell.  They stated that the documents were likely prepared for the U.S. Coast Guard under contract and are maintained and distributed only by the USCG.  We request your assistance in obtaining the ATF3 manuals as listed in the SOO Section 3.0 from the USCG.

A83: Honeywell Document Numbers: 72-00-51 Illustrated Parts Catalog rev 25; 72-00-52 Light Maintenance Manual rev 22; 72-00-53 Heavy Maintenance Manual rev 17; TI 8048 rev K.
Point of contact: Jeffrey Tormanen, Honeywell Aerospace, Global Customer Care, 1-800-601-3099, pubs@honeywell.com.

There are several more questions/answers to be provided later this week.

4.  POSITION TITLE: Program Assistant / Program Manager

5. MARKET VALUE: This position has been designated as a tandem/ladder position.  The highest level of this position is a GS-12; however, USAID intends to fill this position at the GS-9 or GS-11 equivalent level.  The entry level for this position has been established at either the GS-9 level (Salary range: $50,408 - $65,531 per year) or the GS-11 level (Salary range: $60,989  $79,280 per year).  The actual salary of the successful candidate will be negotiated within the pay range of the GS-9 or GS-11 level depending on qualifications, previous relevant experience and work history, salary and educational background.  Salaries over and above the top of the pay range will not be entertained or negotiated.  

The title of the position at the GS-9 level will be Program Assistant.  Following at least one (1) year at the GS-9 equivalent grade the candidate may have the opportunity for advancement to a GS-11 equivalent grade.  To be eligible for promotion to the GS-11 level, the incumbent must meet the minimum qualifications of the GS-11 grade, and receive an Excellent performance rating in the annual performance evaluation.  The evaluation must include a statement by the supervisor that the employee is performing successfully at the current grade and is considered ready to perform at the higher grade level.  Neither advancement nor extension of the contract is guaranteed.

The title of the position at the GS-11 level will be Program Manager.  Following one (1) year at the GS-11 equivalent grade the candidate will have the opportunity for advancement to a GS-12 equivalent grade.  To be eligible for promotion to the GS-12 level, the incumbent must meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-12 grade, and receive an Excellent performance rating in the annual performance evaluation.  The evaluation must include a statement by the supervisor that the employee is performing successfully at the current grade and is considered ready to perform at the higher grade level.  Neither advancement nor extension of the contract is guaranteed.

Applicants must review their experience/education against the required minimum qualifications for both the GS-9 and GS-11 positions carefully.  Applicants may submit for more than one position/grade level (only at the GS-9 or GS-11 levels), but must submit a separate application for each position.  No applications will be accepted for the GS-12 level.  Applicants must be cautious:  those who submit an application for the GS-11 grade level, but do not meet the minimum qualifications as reviewed by the Technical Evaluation Panel (TEC) will not be considered for the GS-9 position unless they submitted a complete separate application for the GS-9 grade level and meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-9 position as reviewed by the TEC.  On the other hand, applicants who apply for only the GS-9 position even though they might meet the minimum qualifications for the GS-11 position will not be considered for the GS-11 position unless they also apply for that position.

8.  STATEMENT OF WORK

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organizations programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/.

FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.

MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>FA8202-09-R-1000<br />A-10 European and Pacific In-theater Depots<br />Draft RFP and Pre-Proposal Conference</strong></p>
<p>The A-10 System Program Office (SPO) hereby posts the attached draft RFP for industry consideration and would also like to announce a pre-proposal conference to discuss the United States Air Force requirement for in-theater contract depot repair support for A-10 aircraft based overseas at Spangdahlem AB, Germany (USAFE) and Osan AB, Republic of South Korea (PACAF). The A-10 SPO is interested in meeting with industry representatives to answer questions and receive feedback regarding this requirement to assist with acquisition planning and program strategy.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br />There are two separate contracts associated with this Pre-Proposal Conference. For each region of operation, Europe and the Republic of South Korea, the U.S Government intends to make a single award to a technically responsive source with a 5-year Requirements type contract. The estimated workload is 3-6 aircraft inductions per fiscal year for SLEP/SSI plus occasional drop-in maintenance and Contract Field Team deployments as necessary. Future aircraft modification programs may also be a requirement for these contracts. Best Estimated Quantities are included in the attached RFP. Please note that although Precision Engagement modifications will be included as a requirement for PACAF, this will be an optional CLIN. As of this time, the USAF has not made a final decision on whether to accomplish PE at the in-theater contract depot.</p>
<p>In order to be considered for this workload, a qualified offeror must operate the proposed depot maintenance facility within unrefueled A-10 flight range (400 Nautical Miles) of the respective A-10 operating location (Spangdahlem or Osan AB).</p>
<p><strong>Draft RFP</strong></p>
<p><br />The attached draft RFP is being included for industry comment/consideration and IS NOT a formal Request for Proposal. The government seeks industry feedback on all aspects of this draft solicitation including the PWS. In addition, the government is seeking input on the following items of interest:<br />1. The number of flow days the contractors feel that each FFP task will require as set forth in Section B. <br />2. The feasibility of providing past performance that meets the relevancy criteria in Section M, para 2.1.2.<br />3. The clarity of technical evaluation subfactors in Section M, para 2.4 - 2.6.<br />4. The clarity of Section L, Instructions to Offeror</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please provide written comments on the draft RFP by 1600 MST 13 Mar 2009.</span></strong></p>
<p>Not all portions of the draft-RFP are being posted at this time. Updates/additions will be posted when and if they become available. Please check FBO often for updates.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Proposal Conference</strong></p>
<p>1. The purpose of this conference is to provide open dialogue between government and industry in response to the draft RFP. In order for this to be an effective exchange, the government requests a list of agenda topics and specific questions that industry would like the Government to address. The Government does not intend to present additional information beyond what has been made available in the draft RFP and previous FBO postings. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please submit your agenda topic recommendations and specific questions to the industry day POC not later than 13 March 2009.</span></strong> Early submissions are encouraged.</p>
<p><br />2. At this time the government does not intend to limit the number of representatives attending from each contractor's firm. However, depending on responses from industry, the government may be forced to impose limits due to room capacity.</p>
<p><br />3. In order to attend Industry Day, each contractor must provide the following for each attendee:</p>
<p><br />a. Name, address and CAGE code of firm<br />b. Indicate status of company - Small Business or Large Business<br />c. Full Name of individual, citizenship status and contact information<br />This information must be received by the Pre-Proposal Conference POC via email not later than 13 March 2009.<br />In addition, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">all foreign national attendees must submit a Foreign Visit Request through their respective embassy and provide a clearance number.</span></strong> Please contact the Pre-Proposal Conference POC with any questions or concerns.</p>
<p><br />4. If time permits, one-on-one sessions may be offered on 17 March after the open sessions. These sessions will be coordinated at the conclusion of the open session.</p>
<p><br />5. An optional tour of the Ogden Air Logistics Center A-10 Depot Repair Line is being considered. Please indicate your interest in attending a tour and the names of attendees by <strong>13 Mar 2009</strong>. Note: this tour will be identical to the tour given at the Nov 2008 industry day. No new information will be provided and this is primarily geared towards contractors who were unable to attend the November 2008 industry day tour.</p>
<p><br />6. A Base Access Letter will be coordinated in advance once your RSVP and Foreign Visit Request (if applicable) have been received. If you require any assistance obtaining base access or directions to Hill AFB please advise the Industry Day POC.</p>
<p><br />7. Additional details regarding this Industry Day will be posted once they become available. Please check back for updates.

<DESC>Amendment A001 issued to correct the clause reference in the Travel and Subsistence CLINs to H.8, rather than H.12.
The FAA Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center has a requirement for environmental architecture and engineering (A&E) services.  Prospective activities include field investigations, production of plans, specifications, studies, calculations, estimates, laboratory analyses, preparation of worker health and safety, sampling and other plans, field sampling (including groundwater, soil, sediment, surface water and air), and detailed counter-measure plans; noise evaluations; industrial waste water pretreatment; air quality (including indoor air quality; environmental assessments (EAs) and environmental due diligence audits (EDDAs); hazardous material storage and handling; groundwater assessments; SARA Title III program; PCB abatement; pollution prevention opportunity assessment, and fuel storage tank management. (See attached Statement of Work.)
It is anticipated than an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type contract, with fixed labor hour provisions, will be awarded covering these environmental A&E services.  Requirements are estimated at $200,000 per year.  The resultant contract will include a base year and four 1-year renewal options.  These options may or may not be exercised, at the sole discretion of the FAA.
This requirement is available for full-and-open competition.
A technical, as well as cost, evaluation will be conducted to determine "Best Value" to the FAA.  A description of the technical submittal and subsequent evaluation can be found in Sections L and M of the Screening Information Request/Request for Offer (SIR/RFO).
The A&E firm's submission of Standard Form (SF) 330 must demonstrate its qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors.  The evaluation factors are listed in descending order of importance.  Specific evaluation factors include: 
1. Specialized Experience and Technical Competence-Offeror shall submit examples (detailed reviews) illustrating technical and managerial capabilities utilized in each of the following areas: (i) environmental assessment (NEPA) or environmental due diligence audit, (ii) pollution prevention project implementation (can include permit compliance projects), (iii) environmental management system implementation (can include ISO 14001 implementation), and (iv) environmental remedial investigation and design (CERCLA) performed within the last ten (10) years.  These reviews must illustrate the scope of each effort, their complexity, how schedules were implemented and how objectives were met (include timetables.)  Projects completed for the Federal Government, in particular, should be included, if any.
2. Past Performance-For each of the examples presented in response to Factor 1 above, offerors shall provide information on past performance in terms of cost control, quality of work, accuracy of construction cost estimates, and the number, dollar amounts, and reasons for construction change orders.
3.

Rsums should include:  name, educational background, present position or title, types of experience by years, and any other information in sufficient detail to facilitate evaluation of qualifications and administrative or technical competence.  Rsums of key individuals employed by subcontracted firms shall also be included.  For executive/supervisory personnel, a minimum of three years of direct executive/supervisory control of an organization involved in the planning and implementation of complex environmental projects is required.  The project manager or supervisor must be a registered Professional Engineer currently registered in the state of Oklahoma or able to obtain such registration within thirty (30) days of contract award.  For technical personnel, a minimum of three years experience in the design and execution of a variety of complex environmental investigations is required.  Offeror shall provide documentation as to laboratory capability for one or more primary laboratories and one or more quality assu7rance laboratories.  Documentation should be sufficient to indicate that laboratory capabilities in such areas as analytical methodology, quality assurance and reporting are equivalent to those required of laboratories participating in the EPA Contract Laboratory Program (CLP.)  Evidence of current participation, as a CLP laboratory, will be sufficient to meet this requirement.
4. Capacity to Accomplish the Work in the Required Time-Offeror shall submit a description of the firm's current workload; i.e. total number of on-going projects, their value or fee and their percentage of completion.  In addition, examples of completed projects and time tables associated with their completion should be provided.  Clearly indicate how the workload of this contract can be accomplished within present resources or a plan should be submitted which demonstrates growth capability commensurate with workload requirements and the effect of this contract.  If offeror does not presently employ sufficient executive/supervisory or technical personnel to meet the requirements, submit a plan for recruitment along with minimum experience levels that are required.  Employment of subcontractors shall be considered recruitment for the purpose of the criterion.  In addition, offeror shall provide a description of its cost accounting and control system.
5. Geographic Location-The offeror's geographic location relative to the Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, will be evaluated in this element, with higher scores given to those firms closest to the Aeronautical Center.
6. Minority and Women Employment-The percentage of minority employees in all job classifications and pay scales, noting the percentage of minorities in the immediate locality and general surrounding area, and the number of women in all job classifications and pay scales, will be evaluated.
Should subcontracting arrangements be required to perform under the proposed contract, all subcontractors must also complete the SF330, with the prime contractor submitting them as a part of their technical proposal.  
Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration, www.ccr.gov on the date established for receipt of offers (April 23, 2009).  Reference AMS clause 3.3.1-33, paragraph (d), "if the offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer may proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."
In addition, offerors must complete and return the attached Business Declaration Form.  The form is provided as a separate document under this announcement.  The FAA reserves the right to review and verify each offeror's program eligibility.
Complete submittals, both technical and cost proposals, must be received by the FAA, no later than 3:00 p.m. CST, Thursday, April 23, 2009.  Any responses received after that date and time will not be considered in accordance with AMS provision 3.2.2.3-14, Late Submissions, Modifications, and Withdrawals of Submittals.  If all requested information is not furnished, the vendor's response may be determined ineligible.
Hand-delivered responses will need to allow sufficient time to process through security procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.

<DESC>Availability of a prospectus for solicitation to sell convenience items within certain parks located in the southeast region.  The sales locations are geographically dispersed; the allotted spaces for the visitor convenience items are small and potential gross revenue is very limited.  Gross revenues over the past five years have been from $1,297,052 to $694,022  annually.
The term of this contract is expected to be fen years, and will require a minimum franchise fee to paid to the National Park Service of 2% of gross receipts, or $200 whichever is greater.  The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR 51 has determined that this is not a qualified contract, within the meaning regarding determination of a preferred offeror.  The current concessioner has been determined to have been a 'satisfactory' operator. The current concessioner is considered not to be a 'preferred offeror' which basically means that they do not have the right to match the terms of any better offers. Offers must be received by June 1, 2009 by 4:00 p.m.  
The Prospectus will explain the business opportunity, the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract, the opportunity, the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract, the proposal instructions, and the proposal package (including the selection factors). There will be an administrative charge to recoup printing cost of $50.00 plus a $5.00 mailing fee for each prospectus. Please make checks for $55.00 payable to the National Park Service.

All requests for prospectuses should be made in writing to Cherrie Brice, Concessions Management Specialist, National Park Service, AFC, 1924 Building, 100 Alabama Street, S.W., Atlanta, GA  30303. No telephone requests for the prospectus will be honored. Please note that no further information than that provided above is available through any other internet resources or links. Concession contracts are not contracts within the meaning of 41 USC 601 et seq. (The Contract Dispute Act) and are not service or procurement contracts within the meaning of statutes, regulations or policies that apply only to federal servicecontracts or other types of federal procurement actions.

<DESC>CLARIFICATIONS:

Potential offerors have requested clarification on several issues:

1.  The existing conditions drawings provided were limited, and in particular electrical drawings were missing.  We will not require reconstruction of plant MEP drawings as part of the record drawings process.  Record drawings must accurately reflect all equipment installed as part of this project, and must contain plant layouts to the extent that GSA can provide existing plant drawings as a basis for this.  

2.  Design drawings (submitted during the design phase, not as part of proposals) must be stamped by an appropriate PE registered in any state.

3.  The Contractor will be expected to commission the systems impacted regardless of whether GSA hires a third-party commissioning agent.  The Contractor will not be required to hire a third party commissioning agent, but is expected to have competent personnel perform pre-functional and functional performance testing.  Functional performance testing must thorougly test all sequences of operation.  Because this project includes new plant controls and programming, all plant sequences (chilled and hot water systems) must be tested.  If GSA hires a third party commissioning agent, such commissioning agent will be given authority to approve in advance the commissioning process and tests proposed by the Contractor.

<DESC><p>Q&amp;A from conference held 18 Mar 2009
<p><br />Are design services expected in addition to Construction Management Services (CMS)? Design services are not part of the CMS solicitations. Design services are covered under separate AE IDIQ or C contracts. There will be a forthcoming solicitation for Large Army Projects SAD - wide. The Sources Sought response for this solicitation will determine if there will be a SB set aside in addition to the unrestricted contract(s).</p>
<p>Are CMS projects for the Corps contracted with General Contractors only or are there opportunities for SDV Architecture/Engineering/Project Management firms? No, CMS is not targeted at GCs only. There certainly are opportunities for SDV AE/PM firms. The purpose of the current CMS solicitations (other than the one for the Savannah River Site) is to augment resources for the SAS Construction Division.</p>
<p>Will Construction Management Services encompass augmenting or supplanting USACE Savannah staff in only the management of construction work; or do the Services encompass providing General Contractor capabilities including providing labor to complete construction work? i.e. Will construction work be bid separate from management? Yes, CMS will augment the USACE staff as if they were one of us. It will be in the oversight of construction contracts and does not encompass providing actual construction work. There is no construction work under this contract.</p>
<p><br />Are design services expected in addition to Construction Management Services? No, we use the CMS contracts to provide additional staff to do construction oversight. Design services are obtained from other vehicles.</p>
<p>Will BIM expertise be a requirement? BIM expertise is not a requirement for selection. If we needed a CMS individual with BIM expertise this would be obtained by so stating in an individual task order scope.</p>
<p>Will the solicitation be administered under the Brooks Act? Yes, CMS is considered an A-E requirement and will be administered under the Brooks Act.</p>
<p>What percentage of the work must be completed by the prime? 50% of the work must be completed by the Prime Contractor.</p>
<p>Can a vendor bid on just a portion of a listing or must they apply for the whole contract? No, a vendor can not submit a bid for a portion of the requirement; however, the Government may award a portion of the total requirement to different entities.</p>
<p>Where can we find names of Prime Contractors for CMS requirements? Refer to the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://fedbizopps.gov) for questions regarding previous contract awards.</p>
<p>Can a contractor not certified as a small business under 541310 be used as a subcontractor and included in a Prime's subcontracting plan? This notice is restricted to small business therefore in accordance with FAR 19.702(b) subcontracting plans are not required from small business concerns.</p>
<p>It is not a role of the Contracting Officer to determine the appropriateness of a subcontractor for a subcontracting plan. A contractor acting in good faith may rely on the written representation of its subcontractor regarding the subcontractor's status as a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or a woman-owned small business concern. The clause at 52.219-25, Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Program-Disadvantaged Status and Reporting, requires the contractor to obtain representations of small disadvantaged status from subcontractors through use of a provision substantially the same as paragraph (b)(1)(i) of the provision at 52.219-22, Small Disadvantaged Business Status. The clause requires the contractor to confirm that a subcontractor representing itself as a small disadvantaged business concern is identified by SBA as a small disadvantaged business concern by accessing SBA's database (PRO-Net) or by contacting the SBA's Office of Small Disadvantaged Business Certification and Eligibility. The contractor, the contracting officer, or any other interested party can challenge a subcontractor's size status representation by filing a protest, in accordance with 13 CFR 121.1601 through 121.1608. Protests challenging a subcontractor's small disadvantaged business representation must be filed in accordance with 13 CFR 124.1015 through 124.1022.</p>

<DESC>The following question has been answered by the Grantee.

Question:
Our interpretation of the RFP is that the feasibility study will include infrastructure/architecture/design for both IT/information infrastructure as well as physical infrastructure such as buildings and floor plans. Please let us know if this is correct.

Answer:
Regarding techology definitions and business model, what we need are details and technical specifications; as to design, the company does not need to produce a blueprint. However, it should provide a  project (in 3D, for example) of the suggested architectonic display for the park (e.g. where each sector should be located, entrances, common areas, the best transportation system, etc.)

<DESC>Question 1:
Based on a review of the RFP there would appear to be a miss-alignment between a) Section 4 AWARD CRITERIA (page 14) of the RFP and description of service needs as discussed in the section titled ELEMENTS OF THE FEASIBILITY STUDY (page 7 and 8 of ANNEX II).  By way of illustration, the RFP AWARD CRITERIA allocates 100 points across four (4) criteria
a)    Technical Expertise (30 pts)  requesting design, construction and management expertise, knowledge of Brazilian public finance, expertise in economic and financial analysis, expertise in urban and regional planning
b)    Work plan and methodology (40 pts)  requesting a detailed work plan
c)    Regional Experience (20pts)  requesting familiarity with technology park design, construction and management in Brazil and Latin America
d)    Financial Experience (10 pts)  requesting project financing and estimating
Yet, in the section ELEMENTS OF THE FEASIBILITY STUDY the communicated needs could be characterized as
a)   Seeking an understanding of the merits of Brasilia as a location for a technology park relative to other competing alternatives both within Brazil , the region, and globe
b)    How the project should be positioned based on the context above
c)    What return on investment is likely

Answer 1:
We have not identified a specific question.
We do not see any misalignment regarding award criteria and the service needs, since the company should meet the criteria in order to best provide the service required

Question 2:
Could you please obtain clarity of the primary focus of the initiative?  Understanding the bullets below are a gross characterization of the need, is it
a)    Design, construction and financing etc, or
b)    Merits of the park and how to strategically position the park versus competing alternative

Answer 2:
Both items A + B.

Question 3:
How many sites are to be considered for Phase 1 & 2.

Answer 3:
Annex I of the RFP states clearly what should be provided. The number of sites visited should be studied by each company and suggested in its final proposal.
 
Question 4:
By Phase 3 and onward, will more than one site be under consideration for further development?

Answer 4:
We expect the company to indicate the best site. Should there be more than one ideal location, we will select the most viable.

Question 5:
Is there already a list of potential tenants, building owners or users identified for this development?

Answer 5:
We expect the consultancy company to produce such list.

Question 6:
We need further explanation about the deliverable items described in TASK 4: DEVELOP FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATIONS, ARCHITECTURE, AND BUSINESS MODEL.  We'd like to know what aspects should be described in terms of details and technical specifications about the project concerning design (does it mean architecture - construction blue print?), technology definitions and business model.  Please advise.

Answer 6:
Regarding techology definitions and business model, what we need are details and technical specifications; as to design, the company does not need to produce a blueprint. However, it should provide a  project (in 3D, for example) of the suggested architectonic display for the park (e.g. where each sector should be located, entrances, common areas, the best transportation system, etc.)
