Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.  
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. 
22.	UID:  If unit price exceeds $5,000.00 then UID requirements will apply.

<DESC>NSN 4820-01-584-3317. Item Description: Sea Water Control Kit. Manufacturer's Code and Part Number: CAGE (1H855) P/N IEC-TEM-9537916.
<p>Quantity: 8. Unit of Issue: AY. Destination Information: Virginia Beach, VA. Delivery Schedule: 145 days.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 14 APR 2017. The Small Business size standard is 750 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved source is: Ives Equipment Corporation (1H855).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days ot the posting of this notice.</p>

Efforts for the SCaN Program include specific expertise in the areas of protocol engineering, design, analysis, networking, modeling and simulation, and communications. <br /><br />NASA/Headquarters intends to purchase the services from MITRE Corporation / National Security Engineering Center (NSEC) Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC).

NASA has previously received approval for these services.</p>
<p>NASA/Headquarters is pursuing this requirement non-competitively as it is highly specialized services which if awarded to any other source would cause (1) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; and (2)unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>
<p>The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 11, 2017. Such capabilities / qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>
<p><br />Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p><br />All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

The NAICS code is 562112 and the small business size standard for this procurement is $38.5 Million.  

This procurement is a 100% set-aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).  
All interested Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms must be registered in the The System for Award Management at http://www.sam.gov/ and registered at the VetBiz Vendor Information Pages: https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/Public/Register/Benefits.aspx as a SDVOSB firm.

A Request for Quote (RFQ) for this service is anticipated to be released on or about August 1, 2017.
*Disclaimer: All data contained herein is for information only and is subject to change. The data is for general purposes ONLY and SHALL NOT be used in preparation of any offer to the Government. 














Performance Work Statement
Regulated Medical Waste
GENERAL
Contractor shall provide complete removal, disposal and transportation of all regulated medical waste (RMW) for the VA Tennessee Valley Healthcare System (TVHS).  The Contractor shall furnish all personnel, materials, tools and equipment necessary to perform the task in accordance with the schedule and to comply with all guidelines established by Federal, State and local laws and ordinances.  
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines RMW as "any solid waste that is generated in the diagnosis, treatment, or immunization of human beings or animals, in research pertaining thereto, or in the production or testing of biologicals."  This may include any waste material or article which harbors, or may reasonably be considered to harbor, pathogens which might be expected to produce disease in healthy individuals.  Medical waste subject to these requirements includes waste that generally has been considered infectious or potentially infectious by the health care community, as well as waste originating from health care or research facilities that are aesthetically objectionable and thus, problematic when disposed of improperly.  "Trace" chemotherapeutic waste shall be included in the scope of this contract. "Bulk" chemotherapeutic waste shall be managed as hazardous waste within the generating facility and disposed of through a separate contract.
One of TVHS s top priorities is the minimization of waste to include significant efforts in recycling and waste diversion.  It is highly encouraged that prospective bidders give significant consideration to recycling and diversion efforts as part of their submittal.  Preference will be given to bidders who consider recycling, diversion and waste minimization efforts as part of their submittal although this alone will not be the deciding factor.  The requested services will render all RMW, chemotherapeutic and pathological waste non-recognizable and non-infectious.  It is preferable that resulting waste be sent for disposal as fuel in electrical co-generation and/or as much of the waste be recycled as possible (e.g. plastic, metal, etc.).  Waste may be incinerated in lieu of co-generation but resulting ash placed in a landfill should be reduced to about 7-10% of the original waste volume.  Submittals that simply identify treated waste as being sent to a landfill may not be considered.
REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE (RMW) REQUIREMENTS
Contractor to provide collection containers that are reusable, sealable, leak proof and puncture resistant with secure lids that can be used at point-of-generation collections/stations throughout TVHS facilities.  In FY16, TVHS generated approximately 343,000 pounds of medical waste at the Nashville Campus and 82,000 pounds of medical waste at the Alvin C. York Campus in Murfreesboro.  The volume of waste at outpatient clinics is nominal.
The contractor shall adhere to the following regulations. Regulations stated should only be used as a guide and are not intended to be all-inclusive regulations that the contractor must comply with.
The contractor shall submit all state department and public reports as required.
Pursuant to codes of the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC), Division of Solid Waste Management.
The contractor must comply with executive order 13101 (SEPTEMBER 14, 1998) GREENING THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH WASTE PREVENTION, RECYCLING AND FEDERAL ACQUISITION.
The contractor shall utilize an on-line manifest system to receipt for materials and certify proper disposal and that is compatible with current VA computer systems. The contractor will submit the proposed manifest system forms for VA approval. After approval of the online system and award of the contract, the Contractor will furnish login information to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) to access the online manifest system.  The contractor will leave one copy of the manifest with the COR at the time of the pick-up showing the quantity picked up. The completed manifests will be returned within Thirty (30) days to the COR. Manifest shall contain at minimum the signature, address and contact information of (1) generator, (2) transporter and (3) final destruction/disposal representative.
Plant must comply with the Clean Air Act of 1991 and produce only safe neutral by-products and the vendor must be able to show compliance with all environmental applicable state and county regulations.
The COR or designee will verify weights/counts of materials being picked up. 
The contractor is responsible for notifying the COR or designee upon arrival and departure at all pick-up locations.
The following is a listing and description of the medical wastes that are, at a minimum, included in the scope of this contract:
Cultures and stocks: Cultures and stocks of infectious agents and associated biologicals, including: cultures from medical and pathological laboratories; cultures and stocks of infectious agents from research and industrial laboratories; wastes from the production of biologicals; discarded live and attenuated vaccines, and culture dishes and devices used to transfer inoculate and mix cultures.
Pathological Waste: Human pathological wastes, including tissues, organs and body parts and body fluids that are removed during surgery or autopsy, or other medical procedures, and specimens of body fluids and their containers.

<DESC>This pre-solicitation synopsis constitutes a pre-solicitation notice and posting of a DRAFT RFP for the acquisition of Joint Force Development (JFD) operations support to the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS or simply JS) and components of the JS. It is anticipated the preponderance of requirements will be generated by the Director J7, whose mission is to develop and enable trained, ready, and adaptable joint and coalition forces for the regional and functional Combatant Commanders. The emphasis will be towards Joint Force Development (JFD) operations support tasks required in simulated and/or real-world events (local, remote, distributed, live, virtual, and constructive; friendly, neutral, and threat forces).
 Tasks include, but are not limited to: cybersecurity, exercise and event design, planning, execution and analysis, concept development, capabilities and solutions, planning, scheduling, logistics, modeling, simulation architecture design, simulation model management and operations, around-the-clock simulation pipeline operations, intelligence, scenario development, database builds and tests, distributed learning, courseware development, event response and control cells, assessment, and facility operations, as well as development of future joint training environments, and the test and evaluation of proposed new equipment using the existing joint training environment resources. Refer to the attached DRAFT RFP for further details concerning the Performance Work Statement (PWS) requirements.
  

This opportunity was previously publicized as a sources sought synopsis under RFP #N0018917RJFD1. The information received in response to the sources sought synopsis coupled with Industry Day conducted on 26 August 2017 has resulted in the determination that the procurement will be processed on a competitive, unrestricted, best value basis in accordance with the procedures set forth at FAR part 15 (Contracting by Negotiation). It is anticipated that Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts where Firm Fixed Price and Cost Plus Fixed Fee task orders can be issued will result from the formal competitive solicitation.  It is anticipated that the ordering period under the resultant contract will commence 01 May 2019 through five years thereafter and include an additional 6 month option pursuant to the authority set forth at FAR clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services.
 The applicable NAICS code and size standard for this procurement are 541330 and $38.5M, respectively. 

The Government will review the feedback and questions received in response to the DRAFT solicitation for the development of the formal Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government anticipates release of the formal RFP during the month of January 2018.  The Government is not soliciting and will not evaluate any offeror proposals received in response to the DRAFT Solicitation. Please direct any and all inquiries to mary.mezzatesta@navy.mil.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS

The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), with University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) to conduct research in areas topical to the subject of designing sustainable supply chains for the recovery of renewable energy and nutrients from post-livestock organic material by (1) applying multi-product network models; (2) developing decision-making framework for multiple stakeholders on conflicting objectives; (3) establishing consensus evaluation indicators and compromise solutions; and (4) providing a computerized application platform and case study demonstration of sustainable supply chains. 
  
The EPA has identified The University of Wisconsin-Madison as the only contractor able to meet the requirements of this procurement. University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) is the only known source able to satisfy the Governments requirement(s) since it has the necessary unique process systems engineering capabilities, including, but not limited to numerical solution and high-performance computing facilities (http://zavalab.engr.wisc.edu/computing), multi-product supply chain network models, risk-averse optimization techniques (conditional value at risk, CVaR), mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) tools, real time simulation and optimization tools for supply chains, superstructures, and other state-of-the-art facilities to conduct this research. UW has a first-tier process systems engineering group with strong emphasis and capabilities in the areas of mathematical optimization model formulation for optimal control, supply-chain design, multi-criteria decision making, and systems design. The Scalable System Laboratory (SSL) housed at UW is being leveraged for performing several unique research projects in the areas of i) the interplay between economic and physical behavior of complex systems and ii) developing decision-making strategies to manage multiple conflicting objectives, multiple time and location scales, and uncertainty. In addition, other areas of interest include chemical production facilities, biogas supply chains, nutrient recovery, electrical power networks, natural gas networks, and buildings. 

This will result in a firm-fixed price contract. We anticipate issuing a solicitation on or about November 15, 2017.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541715 Research and Development in the Physical Engineering and Life Sciences, with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees. It is our intent to award a single fixed price purchase order to procure the required items. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice and does not constitute a solicitation. This synopsis is released pursuant to FAR &sect; 5.2 Synopsis of Proposed Contract Action. <br /><br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has a requirement for a fleet of the Cutter Boat-Large (210/225), hereafter referred to as CB-L, which will replace cutter boats on at least four classes of USCG cutters (210 WMEC, 225 WLB, CGC ALEX HALEY and CGC MACKINAW) and which will interface with the existing single point davits on those cutters. This requirement will be procured through a single award commercial Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Contract with firm-fixed price delivery orders with an ordering period of 5 years from date of award of the contract. The CB-L will perform missions that require the projection of USCG capabilities within line-of-sight range of the cutter while underway. Missions will be performed throughout a spectrum of climates, weather conditions, sea states, and in both day and night environments. This requirement will be conducted under the following U.S. Code provisions, listed in descending order of precedence, regarding the requirement to build boats for the Government within the United States: (a) 14 USC &sect; 665 - Restriction on Construction of Vessels in Foreign Shipyards and (b) 10 USC &sect; 7309 - Construction of Vessels in Foreign Shipyards: Prohibition. <br /><br />The USCG is pursuing the Advisory Multi-Step process described in FAR &sect; 15.202 to allow prospective offerors to give Oral Presentations demonstrating qualifications that will allow the USCG to advise them about their potential to be viable competitors for the CB-L. Participation in the Advisory Multi-Step process is voluntary and is not a prerequisite to responding to the CB-L solicitation. Participation in the Advisory Multi-Step process shall not obligate the USCG to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs of charges or any other remuneration whatsoever.<br /><br />Location - Oral presentations held at CG Headquarters (2703 Martin Luther King Jr Ave SW) 14-16 Nov. Please contact the Contract Specialist by 10 Nov to set up a one-hour time slot (0800, 1000, 1300, 1500). Time slots will be issued first come, first serve.<br /><br />Attendees - Each prospective offeror will be limited to three people. Information regarding visitor access will be distributed by email after a time slot is booked.<br /><br />Time Limit - Oral presentations are limited to one hour. <br /><br />Documentation: Send to the Contract Specialist via AMERDEC SAFE (https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/safe/About.aspx) any digital material needed to be displayed for the presentation at least one day before the presentation. Please provide eight copies of any paper material. <br /><br />Exchanges - The USCG anticipates exchanges with prospective offerors after the completion of the oral presentation. If exchanges are necessary, after completion of the oral presentation, the USCG will excuse the prospective offeror from the presentation room to formulate relevant clarification questions pertaining to the presented material. The prospective offeror will then be notified by the Contracting Officer that they may return back to the presentation room wherein the clarification questions will be communicated by the Contracting Officer to the prospective offeror. The prospective offeror will then be permitted to excuse itself, if needed, to allow for a proper response. The duration of exchanges is expected to be 30 minutes total, with a firm time limit of 45 minutes. <br /><br />Content - A prospective offeror shall address the following in its Oral Presentation:<br />1. Parent craft capabilities: The CB-L shall be based on a proven hull (heretofore called the "parent craft") with two years of operation, meeting the minimum requirements in Attachment 1. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Photos or video clips showing parent craft in operation.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Current applications.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. General arrangement drawings.<br />2. Prospective CB-L: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Proposed modifications to parent craft <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Changes to general arrangements to meet draft requirements in Attachment 1 as well as <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the general arrangements in Attachment 2.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. Proposed changes to major equipment/components.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. How these changes will impact performance and stability.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Ability to perform engineering design work and stability/structural calculations. Provide examples from <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; past projects.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Ability to provide technical documentation in accordance with draft requirements in Attachment 3. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide examples from past projects or a plan for this project.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Production capacity at full rate (minimum of 10/year).<br />3. Supportability and Maintainability<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Ability to manage/control configuration and quality on prior acquisitions.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Ability to provide warranty and logistics support, including lessons learned and corrective action <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; implementation from prior acquisitions.<br />4. Price<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Rough order of magnitude cost estimate per prospective CB-L (cost per boat) in accordance with <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attachments 1 &amp; 2.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Rough order of magnitude cost estimate of technical data package in accordance with Attachment 3.<br /><br />Advisory Evaluation Criteria - The USCG will assess all responses in accordance with the following criteria and advise each respondent in writing (within two weeks of presentation) either that it will be a viable competitor in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor (including a general basis for that opinion). The USCG's advice that a prospective offeror is a non-viable competitor is provided for advisory purposes only; it does not constitute a down-select or removal of the prospective offeror from the competition when a solicitation is issued. Notwithstanding the advice provided by the USCG, offerors identified as unlikely to be viable competitors may still participate in the resultant acquisition once a solicitation is released. The Advisory Multi-Step process is entirely independent of the source selection process for the CB-L. Prospective offerors are advised that the solicitation for the CB-L will differ from previous Request for Information (RFI) requirements and will have more extensive and potentially differing requirements than this pre-solicitation notice. <br /><br />A prospective offeror will be considered viable if its presentation demonstrates:<br />1. The parent craft meets the minimum attributes in Attachment 1 and has been in measurable service (i.e. operational hours per year or number of boats in service) for two years. <br />2. The prospective CB-L design's modifications meet the minimum attributes in Attachment 1 as well as the general arrangements in Attachment 2.<br />3. The degree of parent craft modifications necessary to meet CB-L requirements constitutes a manageable technical risk. <br />4. The prospective offeror has the resources (internally or externally) to perform engineering design work and calculations.<br />5. The prospective offeror has provided or has a plan to provide accurate technical documentation (similar to the documentation listed in Attachment 3) within a timely manner.<br />6. The prospective offeror's production capability can achieve at least 10 CB-Ls per year.<br />7. The prospective offeror has sound configuration, quality control, logistics support, and warranty plans and provides examples of constant improvement based on lessons learned.<br />8. The proposed ROM price per boat is realistic and competitive.

This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify potential manufacturing sources and to determine if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside. This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research. No funds are available to fund the information solicited.
<p>The 421St Supply Chain Management Squadron located at Tinker Air Force Base is requesting information, pursuant to FAR PART 10, in support of Market Research to identify potential sources for the manufacture of the NSN(s) listed below. The government does not have the associated technical data to provide to potential sources. No Qualification requirements exist and No Source Approval Request (SAR) package can be submitted. Consequently, potential sources for this effort are companies who must seek the design approval from the Original Equipment Manufacturer. The design approval will be designated by the OEM adding the part number to the existing technical data. The company must have manufactured the Subject items within the past 36 months for the Original Equipment Manufacturer or Department of Defense and intends to produce Subject item to the Subject technical data.</p>

The Government is interested in all businesses to include, Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Businesses 8(a)s, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Hubzone Businesses, and Women-Owned Small Businesses. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime, and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be capable of furnishing all required labor, material, facilities and equipment to accomplish manufacture, test, preservation and packaging, and return to the government a completely serviceable unit. Contractor will be responsible for supply chain management, logistics, forecasting of parts, long-lead parts procurement, reparable forecasting, obsolescence issues and delivery of serviceable assets. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice in writing including details of your ability to either provide a copy of the OEM's manufacturing data (including disassembly, repair, test and an illustrated parts breakdown including part numbers) or an OEM licensee agreement certifying your business is approved by the OEM to manufacture this equipment.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI), Rock Island, IL on behalf of the Product Director Demilitarization (PdD Demil), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, and Joint Munitions Command (JMC) Rock Island, IL is conducting market research seeking potential business sources with the capabilities to design, build, install and test demilitarization support equipment and performance improvement prototypes at U.S. Government owned Army ammunition facilities. The contractor shall also have the capability to characterize existing and new munitions.
<p>Demil is the act of eliminating the functional capabilities and/or inherent military design features from Department of Defense (DoD) personal material. Methods and degree range from removal and destruction of critical features to total destruction by cutting, crushing, shredding, melting, burning, or other methods. Demil is required to prevent property from being used for its originally intended purpose and to prevent the release of inherent design information that could be used against the United States.</p>
<p>The specific requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT:</p>
<p>Perform assigned research and development (R&amp;D) projects designed to increase munition demilitarization capability and develop processes to address current and future capability gaps.</p>
<p>Given a capability gap, perform literature, patent, and technology searches on munitions systems-related elements and systems. Objectives of literature and technical searches shall be directed in subject areas such as identification of critical technology/components, component manufacturing, synthesis, formulation, generation, hazards, storage, stability, characterization, testing, performance, demilitarization, reclamation, and re-use and recycling of munition subcomponents.</p>
<p>R&amp;D Studies: Perform studies of the theory, synthesis and formulation of energetic materials, systems, components or sub-systems to characterize candidate components, compounds, or combined materials. Typical efforts will include:</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze performance through modeling and simulation of new energetic materials and formulations to better understand the materials.<br />&bull; Analyze selected advanced energetic chemical compounds and compositions within munitions or subcomponents which produce special effects.<br />&bull; Demonstrate scale-up calculations and laboratory scale operations supporting scale-up model and computer simulation concept analysis.<br />&bull; Identification of opportunities to maximize efficiencies and reduce or control costs of demilitarization<br />&bull; Analyze current Government Owned facility capabilities to determine if proper process exists, or whether a process improvement can be performed to expand or convert an existing process into a useable process to address the capability gap.</p>
<p>Munitions Characterization: Perform munition characterization to characterize new candidate energetic compounds used in munitions efforts which may include the following: establish molecular homogeneity, determine molecular weight, confirm molecular structure, ascertain bond angles and interatomic distances and determine molecular crystal densities using ultra-violet, infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectroscopies, x-ray crystallography and other analytical technologies.</p>
<p>R&amp;D Prototype/Low Rate/Full Rate Facilities: Design, build, install, and test pilot demilitarization processes. These facilities may be built and proven out at the Contractor's facility and later moved to the Government owned facility or may be built in place at the Government Owned facility to be used for low rate and then final full rate demilitarization. The Government will rely on the contractor to recommend the location of the prototype and of the final facility. The contractor shall also predict and verify final demilitarization costs, identify system integration issues, limitations, critical components and unique system integration challenges.</p>
<p>ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS:</p>
<p>Conduct a technical analysis of facilities, processes, equipment, ordnance items, software, and munition subcomponents associated with energetic materials, residue, and hardware.</p>
<p>Design and perform testing and analyze test results of the demilitarization and disposal of munitions, energetic devices, components, materials and compounds for determination of the viability of various demil processes.</p>
<p>Conduct technology analyses that consider the best ways to demil specific munitions by completing an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). Conduct evaluations of emerging technologies and impact analyses of these new technologies on various environments. These evaluations and technologies shall include applicability/utility, potential return on investment, reuse opportunities, life cycle support impacts and costs, personnel and infrastructure requirements, and change/configuration management issues. This effort may comprise of research and reports or lab scale demonstration for concept prove outs prior to recommending the demil process. Demil process/AoA recommendations shall be made and shall address strategies necessary to achieve the cost/benefit potential.</p>
<p>DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF DEMIL PROCESSES AND PROTOTYPES:</p>
<p>Assist in constructing a program management plan for development that describes the design approach, management structure, project milestones, and product development flow throughout the design, development, and delivery of systems. This plan shall identify and integrate all tasks required to accomplish the development effort by determining the overall scope and strategy for the program.</p>
<p>Assist in identifying appropriate strategies and design elements consistent with the recommendations resulting from the analysis to support the goals and requirements stated in the specific task orders and scope.</p>
<p>Assist in developing documentation that identifies relevant subject matter content, testing strategies, and process activities. Identify and design the system required to support the testing strategies and the attainment of objectives. <br />SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DELIVERY:</p>
<p>Design, develop, install, test and transition pilot systems and processes which are semi to fully automated and provide a means of downloading, accessing, energetic removal and staging of empty munitions bodies, energetic fill, other item components, and waste streams for final disposal. The contractor must have the capability to separate energetic fill from the munitions, and remove the explosive fill from the munitions in such a manner that not less than 75% of the energetic will be separated from the item, packaged, and sent out of the system in a form suitable for reclamation or resale. In the case where the contractor's system does not include separation or processing of munitions fin and propellant charge components, the system must be forward compatible with the design and addition of such equipment and allot for future installation of said equipment.</p>
<p>Support technology transfer efforts by investigating prototype designs and assess the capability of the new technology in solving energetic problems. This requires identifying new technology and assessing the applicability and feasibility of the new technology to be transferred.</p>

<CONTACT>Arash Seddique, Contract Specialist (C), Phone 3014510095, Email arash.seddique@nih.gov - Arash Seddique, Phone 3014510095, Email arash.seddique@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The National Contract Management Association (NCMA) a corporate sponsorship.
<p>The purpose of the corporate membership with the National Contract Management Association (NCMA) is to gain access to the leading professional resources for those in the field of contract management. There are no resellers of the NCMA membership, therefore a solicitation for quotes from other sources is not applicable. NCMA specifically targets the federal contracting community which is the intended target of the National Institutes of Health Information Technology Acquisition and Assessment Center (NITAAC)program.</p>
<p>NCMA has over 20,000 members, and is dedicated to the professional growth and educational advancement of procurement and acquisition personnel worldwide. NCMA provides a forum for military, Government and industry to collaborate.  This sponsorship would enable NITAAC to further its mission of providing low-cost, high quality IT products and services to every government agency through the efficient and economical use of innovative government-wide acquisition contracts and comply with the OMB mandate to promote its GWACs.</p>
<p>This corporate sponsorship gives NITAAC access to over 20,000 members, and 100 chapters. Benefits include access to the NCMA community through corporate visibility through print, web, social media, newswire, mail and NCMA meetings and events. The sponsorship also allow one of NITAACs Executive level staff members to be on NCMA's Board of Directors who includes experienced and influential Executives from many federal agencies.</p>
<p>Corporate membership would also allow NTAAC the opportunity to connect, network, share and partner with other Government entities, and reach decision makers in a more efficient and cost-effective way by reducing exhibiting rates for events, providing more opportunities to speak at events, providing access to contact information that can be used for follow up after an event that would otherwise not be possible without membership.</p>
<p>The government intends to enter into a contract for these services for a base year and up to 4 option years.<br /><br />Responses:<br />The proposed acquisition action is for items and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1 (b). If you believe you can provide the items or services, please forward capability statements that are tailored to the requirements to the Specialist by July 30th, 2017. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any submitted responses should have the announcement number referenced in the subject line of the email the submission is attached to.<br /><br />This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed. Information provided will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for the potential requirement and may lead to the development of a solicitation. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.<br /><br />Any solicitation resulting from the analysis of information obtained will be announced to the public in Federal Business Opportunities in accordance with the FAR Part 5. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).<br />NAICS 813920</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON PRESSURE VESSELS FOR FACILITIES IN SUPPORT OF ROCKET PROPULSION TESTING AT STENNIS SPACE CENTER MISSISSIPPI
<p>SYNOPSIS<br />The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is seeking current market information from pressure vessel manufacturers on large volume, thick shell pressure vessels for hydrogen and inert gas service. The information requested is related to design, materials of construction, and the time required for construction and transport of nine (9) identical vessels meeting the general requirements and special operating conditions described herein.</p>
<p>GENERAL DESCRIPTION<br />Pressure vessels shall be horizontal on saddle supports with cylindrical single layer shells. The maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) shall be no less than 6000 psig.  The volume of each vessel shall be no less than 1500 cubic feet. A minimum of nine (9) vessels are required to provide a total volume of no less than 13500 cubic feet. Code of construction shall be the ASME Section VIII, Division 2 and each vessel shall be code stamped. Installation will be in the Mississippi Gulf Coast region at Stennis Space Center.  <br />Initial fluid service will be with hydrogen and with special operating conditions. After the initial service period, the vessels will be placed into nitrogen, helium, or missile grade air service.</p>
<p>SPECIAL OPERATING CONDITIONS FOR HYDROGEN SERVICE<br />Initial service for the vessels will be with hydrogen in a process that requires partial depressurization (blowdown) over a relatively short time interval. The nominal conditions under which the vessels undergo depressurization are:<br />&bull;	Nominal Ambient and Hydrogen Temperature: 68 &deg;F<br />&bull;	Initial Pressure:  4500 psig<br />&bull;	Depressurization Time:  7 minutes<br />&bull;	Calculated Final Coincident Pressure and Temperature (cold gas): 1665 psig, -56 &deg;F<br />The final cold gas pressure and temperature are calculated assuming isentropic expansion of para-hydrogen with no heat gain from the surroundings. The final temperature is calculated for the gas only and is not intended to be taken as the final temperature of the vessel shell.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice
<p>1. General: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT and is for informational/market research purposes only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION, OR BID, NOR A SYNOPSIS OF A PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION UNDER FAR SUBPART 5.2. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Northwestern Division, Portland District (CENWP) has been tasked to solicit a contract for the for the supply of two (2) complete sets of access platforms needed for in situ access to the turbine runners at The Dalles Dam. NO SOLICITATION IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. The official Synopsis citing the solicitation number will be issued on Federal Business Opportunities, www.fbo.gov, at a later date.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities, and qualifications of various members of the industry, with emphasis on the Small Business Community. Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses (including 8(a) firms), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HubZone) Businesses, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB), and Woman Owned Small Businesses (WOSB) (including Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Businesses (EDWOSB)) are highly encouraged to respond.</p>
<p>The point of contact for small business questions or assistance is the Portland District Deputy for Small Business, Carol McIntyre, at 503-808-4602 or Carol.A.Mcintyre@usace.army.mil.</p>
<p>2. Contract Information: CENWP expects to solicit a contract for the supply of two complete sets of access platforms needed for in situ access to the turbine runners at The Dalles Dam. The contract will include entail shop fabrication, welding to AWS D1.2, weld inspection, shop load testing, supervision of project (The Dalles) staff during at-site assembly of the platforms for training purposes and preparation of detailed fabrication drawings, O&amp;M manuals, and Final detailed &amp; contract drawings. The contract will also include fabrication of approximately 22 rolling carts used to store the platform components and of all necessary rigging equipment needed to assemble and secure the platforms. The proposed project solicitation will utilize best value trade off (BVTO) in awarding a firm-fixed price (FFP) supply contract.

<p>3. Project Description: CENWP requires the supply of two (2) complete sets of access platforms needed for in situ access to the turbine runners at The Dalles Dam, Oregon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dalles_Dam .</p>
<p>Each set of access platforms consists of a Blade Scaffold which rests on top of the blades, a main Turbine Maintenance Platform (TMP) attached to the runner or the discharge ring, and a Draft Tube Access Platform (DTP) attached to the draft tube access door. The two platform sets are not identical because they are for two different families of turbine runners for which the draft tube diameter varies by at least a foot. The majority of all the components for the platforms are made from aluminum according to the requirements of the government's detailed contract drawings. Fabricators must demonstrate experience and certifications needed to perform complicated fabrications and weld aluminum according to AWS D1.2 Structural Aluminum Welding. The Blade Scaffolding consists of six commercially available painters stages connected together by custom welded aluminum connector plates to form a ring plus an additional painters stage used to cross from the wicket gates to the blade scaffold ring. The TMP consists of six truss members connected by structural aluminum tubes using pinned assembly connections to form the main structural sub-assembly. Thirty aluminum decking panels rest on the TMP sub-assembly forming the working surface. The DTP consists of an aluminum platform with guardrails attached to the draft tube door with an access ladder up to the TMP above. All platform elements will be fabricated according to the government's detailed design per the specification requirements and the requirements of AWS D1.2 Structural Aluminum Welding. The contract drawing package is anticipated to consist of approximately 30 drawings for the required platforms.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. Although the Government is not obligated to and will NOT pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis, industry is strongly encouraged to respond to this sources sought notice as information received may affect future acquisitions for the equipment/systems in question.
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Seattle District, is seeking responses from industry to determine if there are any known United States (U.S.) manufactured or substantially changed Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) Zoning Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems in existence that are being used for commercial applications. This requirement includes, but is not limited to, variable refrigerant flow (VRF) multi&#8208;split heat pump (with or without heat recovery) and air conditioning systems.</p>
<p>The information received will be used in a determination as to whether or not an exception to the Buy America statute exists for construction solicitations and contracts that are being performed in the United States and that are valued at less than $7,358,000, due to non-availability or unreasonable cost of U.S.-made VRF HVAC systems.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to this Contracting Officer is whether there exists a U.S.-made VRF Zoning HVAC System featuring a distributed refrigerant system for quicker, easier installation; capability to apply energy for heating or cooling only where it is needed; capability for simultaneous heating and cooling using multiple wall mounted units, ceiling cassette units, and ceiling concealed ducted units; a roof-mounted inverter-driven compressor for high-speed, high-efficiency heating and cooling; capability to communicate on an integrated centralized control network to combine multiple/all indoor units into an energy effective HVAC system for the entire serviced space. The VRF zoning system shall also interface with multiple energy recovery ventilators to provide adequate ventilation throughout the space. A waiver to the Buy America statute will be pursued for an existing construction project(s) at Joint Base Lewis-McChord if it is determined that there is no U.S.-made system that can meet these requirements.</p>
<p>It is requested that manufacturers, distributors, suppliers, and industry experts either provide confirmation that a U.S.-made Variable Refrigerant Flow Zoning HVAC System exists or does not exist. Submit responses to the Contracting Office at the following email addresses: patricia.a.ortiz@usace.army.mil and shannan.m.jones@usace.army.mil.

<p>The information provided in this RFI is notional and may change. The Government is under no obligation to revise any aspect of this RFI should any information provided herein change. The Government will provide any additional information and issue any additional request for information at its sole discretion.<br />2.0 BACKGROUND<br />2.1 The rapid integration of emerging technologies into Marine Corps program of record (POR) systems has dramatically changed the nature of how Marine Commanders execute command and control (C2) and how individual Marines communicate. The implementation of advancements in technology have compelled the Marine Corps to direct voice, video and data networks be integrated and have everything transmitted over internet protocol (EoIP). While merging voice, video and data capabilities can gain efficiencies by reducing the physical scale of communications infrastructure and hardware, it also introduces new vulnerabilities that can significantly degrade the Commander's C2 capability and restrict the ability of individual Marines to communicate to higher command elements and laterally. Specifically, EoIP networks create gaps in our ability to provide robust, reliable, and redundant communication capabilities to users and limit our ability to assure uninterrupted voice communications in scenarios where tactical radio IP-based networks are compromised, degraded or otherwise unavailable. Historically this gap has been filled by utilizing slash wire and tactical field phones. <br />2.2 The End User Device (EUD) would be implemented at the platoon, company, and battalion level as a primary or secondary communications asset for use in defensive positions, force security and general communication scenarios. It would be employed at the regiment, and Major Subordinate Command (MSC) as a means to provide fail-over, survivable communications in a communication degraded or denied environment. This capability could be included as a part of the Combat Operations Center program of record resident at all commands or it could be a stand-alone POR suite of equipment to enable communications in the defense or degraded communications environments. The operators/maintainers of this equipment would be the 06XX, 03XX, and 28XX community; a limited training requirement would be expected to be levied on the School of Infantry and at Marine Corps Communications Electronics School. Any technical or user manuals and training material would be required for implementation into training curriculum with full government use. <br />2.3 The Marine Corps also has an enduring requirement for a wired device that requires low or no power, yet reliably transmits sound all while not adding to the radio frequency (RF) requirements of a unit on the battlefield. This is a capability that could be used by an individual Marine(s) in a fighting position or as a redundant fail-over means to communicate in a combat operations center (COC). <br />2.4 Given modern manufacturing technologies, a portable, ruggedized, small form-factor, low/no power, point-to-point/point-to-multipoint, fail-over voice communication device with capabilities similar to that of a TA-1 or TA-312 field telephone and a J-1077 distribution box could be provided to the individual Marine, fireteam, observation post/force protection post or used for voice fail-over within a company, battalion, regimental or MEF/MSC COC.<br />3.0 GENERAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The proposed equipment must provide the capability of wired communications in a radio frequency denied, degraded or silent environment and an internet protocol denied or degraded environment for the purpose of providing fail-over/contingency communications. The ideal technical solutions should meet the minimum requirements below.<br />3.1 WIRED END USER DEVICE (EUD) REQUIREMENTS<br />3.1.1 Each EUD shall be light weight and portable by a combat loaded individual Marine. <br />3.1.2 Each EUD shall be ruggedized to survive austere field environments, providing resistance to exposure to water, dirt, shock, heat, cold and other conditions typical to field or combat environments.<br />3.1.3 Each EUD shall require low or no power to operate. If a battery is required, it shall be non-proprietary, light weight, cost effective and commercially available or already in use by the USMC in other communication devices.<br />3.1.4 Each EUD shall function in both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint configurations. <br />3.1.5 Each EUD shall transmit a minimum of 2 km while operating in point-to-point configuration. <br />3.1.6 Each EUD shall transmit in full-duplex voice. <br />3.1.7 Each EUD shall have a loudspeaker with on/off switch and volume control.<br />3.1.8 Each EUD shall be capable of signaling the distant end of an incoming call. Distant end signal shall be user-selectable to either audio or visual notification. <br />3.1.9 Each EUD shall be compatible with current field wire mediums. (WD-1, WF-16, CAT 5, etc.)<br />3.1.10 Each EUD shall function in Radio Frequency denied/degraded environment. <br />3.1.11 Each EUD shall function without adding to existing unit RF requirements or adding to the current RF footprint.<br />3.1.12 Each EUD shall function without the need for an IP network. <br />3.1.13 Each EUD shall be easily repairable using field level maintenance capabiity.<br />3.1.14 Each EUD shall function without the requirement for field service representatives (FSR), upgrades, ongoing maintenance contracts or security technical implementation guide (STIG) compliance to implement.<br />3.1.15 Each EUD shall not require extensive training to operate or implement.<br />3.1.16 As an objective requirement, the EUD will be capable of resisting an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP).<br />3.1.17 As an objective requirement, the EUD will be compatible with existing tactical radio handsets and accessories, such as the H-350/U handset and U-183 6-pin connector. <br />3.2 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS<br />3.2.1 There are no threshold security requirements.<br />3.2.2 As an objective requirement, the EUD will be capable of using encryption.<br />4.0 ADMINISTRATION<br />Interested parties are requested to provide an information package addressing their approach to meeting the requirements listed in Section 3 and detailing:<br />4.1 Your organization's description and its capability to provide an integrated solution which meets the requirements set.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a contract to CGI Federal, Inc., 12601 Fair Lakes Circle, Fairfax, VA 22033 for CGI Momentum&reg; software licenses for the NRC's core financial system, as well as hosting, operations and maintenance and help desk support services for that system. The contract will consist of a base period of December 8, 2017 through December 7, 2018 plus four one-year options to extend the term of the contract.
<p>CGI Federal, Inc. currently hosts and supports a version of CGI Momentum&reg; version 7.4.1 (internally known as NRC's Financial Accounting Information and management System (FAIMIS)) that is customized to satisfy the NRC's requirements. The customized system is hosted in an external FedRAMP-compliant cloud environment. FAIMIS also interfaces with NRC legacy applications as well as Federal e-gov solutions.</p>
<p>The NRC has recently confirmed through its market research that CGI Federal does not authorize any other commercial sources to provide the CGI Momentum&reg; software licenses and related services that the NRC requires. Therefore, the only way that the NRC can satisfy its requirements is to directly procure them from CGI Federal, Inc. The authority for this sole source procurement is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1), as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>

<SUBJECT>GSPS Basic IDIQ - 1 Year Extension
<SOLNBR>FA8730-13-D-0009P00009
<RESPDATE>030317
<CONTACT>Mark Luckritz, Contracting Officer, Phone 4022948393, Email mark.r.luckritz.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The AFLCMC/HBCK Air Force procuring contracting office located at Offutt AFB in Nebraska, intends to execute a sole source contract (extension) to Lockheed Martin Services Incorporated (LMSI) under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The subject contract referred to herein on this notice is for an Extension (Contract Extension).
<p>The Government has a valid requirement for continued Global Strike and Product Support (GSPS) software deliveries and related systems engineering for 1 February 2019 - 1 February 2020, to include maintenance/sustainment (M&amp;S), future potential efforts (development), other direct costs (prop prep and travel), special studies/analysis, operational baseline deliveries, and onsite support. The subject contract is not for new work and it can be accomplished within the previously established dollar scope (authorized ceiling value and requirements) of the current GSPS Basic Indefinite-Delivery--Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract with LMSI (Contract Number FA8730-13-D-0009). The Government intends to modify the existing single-award GSPS Basic IDIQ Contract with LMSI by extending the schedule from ending on 31 January 2019 to ending on 31 January 2020 (1 year extension). The current GSPS Basic IDIQ Contract was solicited under full and open procedures where all interested parties were made aware of the potential contract value and contemplated contract scope. Competitive award of the current GSPS contract to LMSI established competitive pricing for IDIQ ordering.</p>
<p>This contract requires significant technical expertise of past, present and future GSPS sub-systems and all other associated Mission Planning and Analysis System (MPAS) sub-systems. This contract is required in order to mitigate GSPS technical, performance, schedule, cost and mission risks so Integrated Strategic Planning and Analysis Network (ISPAN) Increment 4 (Inc4) MPAS Modernization (i.e. development), which encompasses other MPAS sub-systems in addition to GSPS, can be accredited and fielded as fully-operational within Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) timelines. This contract also mitigates GSPS technical, performance, schedule, cost and mission risks as sustainment of a functional maintenance baseline transpires based on real-time needs and so Inc4 MPAS development is consistent with software delivered for the MPAS M&amp;S baseline. This contract requires specific security clearance at the secret classification level and higher for all assigned personnel as well as strict information assurance/cyber security requirements which must be germane on all GSPS software deliveries. This contract requires all GSPS software developers/contractors to be physically located within the USSTRATCOM building located in Omaha, NE.</p>
<p>Conducting a source selection for a new GSPS follow-on contract is not feasible for the Government at this time because the subject Extension to the current GSPS Basic IDIQ Contract offers the most efficient and effective acquisition solution available for continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment and because award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs (which the Government could not recover through competition) and unacceptable delays in the Air Force fulfilling USSTRATCOM mission requirements and Increment 4 MPAS Modernization.</p>
<p>This notice is neither a request for a competitive proposal nor a solicitation for offerors. A determination by the Government to not compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government. Additional requests for information, status or clarification pertaining to this notice shall be declined by the Government. If your company can meet the continuation of all GSPS contract requirements by 3 MARCH 2017, please provide a capability package via electronic commerce to the Contracting Officer at mark.r.luckritz.civ@mail.mil and the Contract Specialist cindy.m.parks.civ@mail.mil by the close of business on FRIDAY, MARCH 3, 2017.</p>

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13) with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM)<br />6710 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20817, as the only responsible source that can provide IBM Kenexa Learning Content Management System (LCMS) Premier on Cloud for FEMA. Specifically, the contractor shall provide a (103) one year licenses for LCMS Premier on Cloud, as well as customization professional services and FedRamp Data Center to FEMA. The period of performance will include a base year and four one-year option periods.<br />&nbsp;
<p>IBM is the sole source capable of meeting FEMA's unique requirements. The Government intends to continue its use of an Enterprise-wide FEMA LCMS through an acquisition of content authoring licenses and accompanying training, support and maintenance. The objective of this procurement is to retain reliable, efficient and effective services through application of a sound management and technical approach that provides the best value and meets the objectives of the Enterprise.</p>
<p>IBM Kenexa has provided an LCMS with annual software licensing to support an organization of over 100 course/content authors across the nation. Software subscriptions are inclusive of all accompanying support, including customer training, maintenance, and version upgrades. The IBM Kenexa LCMS has the capabilities to reduce or expand its licensed course/content authoring end user base. Additionally, the IBM Kenexa LCMS continues to provide the following general capabilities to its FEMA customer:</p>
<p>Note: An exhaustive list of capabilities/requirements is located within the LCMS Statement of Work. Below is a summary of those requirements:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Licenses to support content authoring, quantities of which may change through option years.<br />-&nbsp;Potentiality of delivering e-Learning for up to 10,000 concurrent learners.<br />- Creation of content objects at all levels of aggregation, including raw assets, launchable resources, assignable units, and structured training packages, as in lessons and courses.<br />-&nbsp;Tagging objects with default and user-defined metadata assigned to the aggregation level and retrieving objects at any level for reuse and repurposing in any Content Package.<br />-&nbsp;Page layout support.<br />-&nbsp;Drag and drop interface support.<br />-&nbsp;Document management support.<br />-&nbsp;Personalization support.<br />-&nbsp;Content object search capabilities.<br />-&nbsp;Ability to define, manage, and track critical training projects.<br />-&nbsp;Comprehensive range of content import and content output.<br />-&nbsp;Leverages FEMA customer's Learning Management Systems (LMS).<br />-&nbsp;Supports dynamic content delivery.<br />-&nbsp;Hosted in a FedRAMP authorized environment.<br />-&nbsp;Software application meets accessibility requirements required under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (as amended).</p>
<p>The subject requirement will allow the FEMA Enterprise to maintain continuity within its learning content management established in September 2013 following the competitive procurement of an LCMS that was awarded to IBM Kenexa under commercial purchase order # HSFE20-13-P-0257. IBM Kenexa Premier on Cloud is proprietary and only IBM Kenexa may effect modifications and provide maintenance, support and services. Procurement of a competing LCMS entails far more than procuring new software and content authoring licenses. Procuring and implementing an alternate LCMS at this juncture entails a wholesale revision of a content management strategy developed and nurtured since inception of the current contract with IBM Kenexa. Premier has been implemented in unique fashion within the Enterprise. Resultant risk and certainty of cost duplication to the Government points convincingly toward a procurement avenue representing the best value to the Government and aligned with FAR 13.501(a).</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures (IAW FAR 13). There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 511210 with a Small Business Size Standard of $38.5 million. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement. However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. (IAW FAR 13.501(a)(1)(iii)) The sole source justification will be posted to FedBizOpps within 14 days after contract award</p>
<p>Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to James Suerdieck at james.suerdieck@fema.dhs.gov. <strong>Statements are due by 4:00 PM Eastern, 13 NOV 2017</strong>. No phone calls accepted.</p>

<RESPDATE>113017
<CONTACT>Wendy Paulo, Contracting Officer, Phone 3019753976, Email Wendy.Paulo@nist.gov - Grace H. Garrity, Contracting Officer, Phone 3019752345, Email grace.garrity@nist.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology is conducting market research to obtain information regarding the capability of companies with technologies that can detect trace amounts of synthetic opioids, specifically fentanyl analogs, across a wide range of operational settings.<br />This announcement is not a Request for Proposals or Quotes (RFP/RFQ) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. The information contained in this notice is a DRAFT only and, as such, is subject to change prior to issuance of a solicitation. No solicitation is available at this time. NIST is working with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to identify pre-market or market solutions that fill the needs described here. Pre-market solutions should identify the stage of product development and steps necessary to achieve marketability. A table of device characteristics is included to provide a framework to supply information.<br />Background. The rapidly increasing presence of synthetic opioids, including fentanyl and its analogs, creates a need for rapid trace detection technologies for a range of civilian and military applications. The nature of the samples, specifically the low concentration of the opioid in a complex matrix of excipients, other narcotics, and environmental background, makes detection difficult by standard field and lab technologies. To add to the complication, there are a large number of possible analogs, making detection and differentiation even more difficult. There are two applications where trace detection would be required: 1) in a fieldable device and 2) for a laboratory-based device. An ideal fieldable device would allow first responders and/or warfighters rapid determination of the presence of an opioid threat in a fieldable package while minimizing exposure to non-safe levels of material. Subsequent analysis on a laboratory-based device should be able to detect and determine the exact analog(s) down to 0.1 % by weight levels in the presence of the complex matrix. <br />Requirements. NIST is seeking information on fieldable (handheld or tabletop) or laboratory-based technologies, either in a pre-market or marketable state, that can be used for trace detection of fentanyl and its analogs across a wide range of operational environments. <br />The Government requests potential performers provide up to a five (5) page response containing the following information regarding detection technologies for synthetic opioid threats:<br />1.

<DESC><p>This announcement is associated with a previously posted Sources Sought under N0002416R6413.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION<br />This Industry Day announcement is for market research and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a solicitation and shall not be construed as a commitment by the government to award a contract from responses to this announcement. Any information submitted by interested parties is strictly voluntary and no monetary compensation will be provided for response preparation.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br />The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) is conducting an Industry Day to identify potential sources that possess the capability to perform development of the Tactical Control System (TCS) subsystem within the AN/BYG-1 Combat System.</p>
<p>The TCS subsystem includes applications that provide the warfighter the ability to localize, track, and manage contacts based on sensor inputs provided by other subsystems. Additionally, TCS integrates other tools to help the warfighter plan and execute their missions. Some of these tools will be developed under this contract, and others will be provided to the contractor to be integrated into TCS. TCS will be delivered via the Technology Insertion (TI)/Advanced Processing Build (APB) process as a separate Subsystem.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />TCS is a component of the AN/BYG-1 Submarine Combat Control System (SCCS) that provides fundamental capability essential for safe, submerged operations during all types of submarine missions. The focus of TCS is to provide timely and accurate information to the Commanding Officer and/or Officer of the Deck so that they can position ownship in a tactically advantageous manner, optimally employ ownship's sensors and weapons, and effectively prosecute contacts of interest for intelligence collection (or to engage and destroy them if required). TCS development leverages the Navy's proven Rapid Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) Insertion Business Model which is underpinned by Open Architecture (OA) Principles. TCS improvements will be retrofitted into the current force of US and Royal Australian Navy submarines and will be installed in all new-construction submarines (VIRGINIA Class Attack and Columbia Class Ballistic Missile Submarines (SSBNS)).<br /><br />ACQUISITION STRATEGY<br />The Government is contemplating procuring this effort for a contract duration of one (1) 12-month base year and seven (7) 12-month option years.</p>
<p>This contract will cover the following baselines for the AN/BYG-1 Combat System:<br />TI18/APB19<br />TI20/APB19<br />TI20/APB21<br />TI22/APB21<br />TI22/APB23<br />TI24/APB23</p>

<DESC>N00164-18-S-NB12 - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/SOURCES SOUGHT - WIDEBAND RADIO COMMUNICATION TESTER - FSC 6625 - NAICS 334220
<p><br />Issue Date: 27 OCT 2017 - Closing Date: 03 NOV 2017 - 2:00 PM EDT</p>
<p><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - The Government is issuing this RFI/sources sought announcement as part of market research for a Wideband Radio Communications Tester to support testing at NSWC Crane.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division located at Naval Support Activity, Crane, IN intends to award a sole source contract to the original equipment manufacturer of the CMW500 Wideband Radio Communications Tester, Rohde-Schwarz USA, Inc., Columbia, MD 21046.   This effort will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is the fact that Rhode-Schwarz tester is integrated into an automated test bench and the government has already produced test program sets. To use any other manufacturer's Wideband Radio Communication Tester in this automated test bench would require the Government personnel to re-write the test program set and would take an estimated two years to develop the test program sets.</p>
<p>In accordance with Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) Procedures, Guidance, and Information (PGI) 206.302-1, the Government is accepting information from companies potentially capable of meeting the requirements as described above.  Companies with the capabilities and facilities to that would enable them to meet the Government's requirements may respond.  Responses shall address how respondents would propose to overcome the duplication of cost that the Government would incur from having to re-write the test program sets. Responses should include availability, budgetary cost estimate, and lead time of the solution.</p>
<p>All interested parties may submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than 5 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, a budgetary estimate of test articles, and an explanation as to why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above given the requirement to have access to Rohde-Schwarz USA proprietary hardware and software to meet the requirement.</p>
<p>Responses to the Market Survey shall include the following:</p>
<p>Submitter's Name<br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size<br />Point of Contact (POC)<br />POC Telephone<br />Announcement Number:  N00164-18-S-NB12</p>
<p>Please include the purpose/explanation of the response to the Market Survey, i.e. to better understand the Government requirements; to potentially become a viable source for future requirements; to take exception to the anticipated sole source as your company currently meets all of the Government requirements and can successfully offset the projected cost duplication and schedule delays. The Government may contact RFI respondents to get clarification on the information submitted.</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the Government System for Award Management database (SAM).  Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation of requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the internet at www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>At the current time, NO FUNDING IS AVAILABLE for contractual efforts.  This RFI/sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.</p>
<p>Market Survey information may be submitted to the Point of Contact (POC) any time prior to the expiration of this announcement.  The POC for this effort is Mr. David Stuffle david.stuffle@navy.mil or 812-854-5550.  The mailing address is:</p>
<p>NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane<br />Attention David Stuffle, Code 0242, Bldg 121<br />300 Highway 361, Crane, IN 47522-5001.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI/sources sought may be emailed to the POC above.</p>
<p>If any part of the submittal is classified, please contact the POC for appropriate submission information.</p>
<p>All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTIFICATION REGARDING A HUD INDUSTRY DAY ONLY. This is not a request for offers, quotes or proposals. This notice does not represent a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or award a contract. This is a market research tool only.
<p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will hold an Industry Day on November 16, 2017 from 9:30 am EST at 451 7th Street SW, Washington, DC 20410. The event will also be available for attendance via webcast. The Industry Day will brief interested parties on HUD's requirement for Manufacturing Housing Monitoring Services.</p>
<p><br />Requirement Description:<br />&bull; HUD regulates the design and construction of manufactured housing. The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (the Act), implemented in June 1976, established the framework for the preemptive Federal Standards and the related manufactured housing regulatory programs (HUD programs) in use today.<br />&bull; The Office of Manufactured Housing Programs (OMHP) mission is "to protect the quality, durability, safety and affordability of manufactured homes and facilitate the availably of affordable manufactured homes and to increase homeownership for all Americans." (National Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (as amended in 2000), 42 U.S.C. 5401)<br />&bull; Through HUD's manufactured housing program, unsubsidized affordable housing is available for many families who might otherwise not be able to afford home ownership. Manufactured housing sales comprises of approximately one-in-eleven new single-family homes each year. Approximately Eight (8) million HUD Code homes have been built since 1976, and the overall quality and safety of manufactured homes has continued to improve under the HUD program. About 60 companies produce manufactured housing in about 120 plants (production lines). In fiscal year 2016, 121,731 floors were produced which totaled 78,372 homes.<br />&bull; HUD relies highly upon Contractor services to assist the Department in performing assessment inspections, monitoring and enforcement of manufacturers, private and state agents of HUD responsible for oversight of design and construction of manufactured housing. <br />&bull; HUD is committed to meeting its mission by creating strong, sustainable, inclusive communities and quality affordable homes for all. These services support this overall mission as it will strengthen the Nation's Housing Market to bolster the economy and protect consumers.</p>
<p><br />This is an opportunity for you to review HUD's draft work requirements attached to this announcement and provide comments on how to meet the government's needs.</p>
<p>Acquisition information concerning specific program areas of the proposed acquisition vehicle will be highlighted.</p>
<p>While the event is free to attend, registration is required. Please limit attendance to two (2) representatives per company. In person attendance space is limited. Attendance will also be available via webcast.</p>
<p>To register, e-mail Jerl.S.Traylor@hud.gov and Brandon.A.Carson@hud.gov with the (1) full name, (2) title, (3) company/organization, (4) address, (5) CCR Number, (6) Business size and socio-economic category, (7) e-mail, and (8) phone number for each attendee.</p>

<SOLNBR>140G0118Q0027
<ARCHDATE>11152017
<CONTACT>Demby, Nicole
<DESC>The Department of Interior (DOI), United States Geological Survey (USGS) Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS), Center, Sioux Falls, SD, has a requirement to purchase five (5) fiber optic transmit and receive pairs (10 total items).  The fiber optic links between the antennas and the control room are mission critical items. These pairs connect the control room with the antenna and transmit the data received from the satellite to the control room for transmission to the respective Mission Operation Center (MOC) and receive commands from the MOC for transmission to the respective spacecraft. Due to a failure of a custom production unit, the Landsat Ground Station (LGS) has reduced sparing.  Having the shelf spare reduces the time to repair the link and minimizes the risk of data loss.  Moving away from the currently installed custom units to a standard product allows for reduced cost for each fiber link, and allows for reduce sparing as all links use the same fiber components. 

The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above.  Therefore, it intends to make an award to Narda Miteq, unless it is contacted by any vendor who believes they can provide the same service.  Vendors are invited to contact the Contract Specialist, Nicole Demby (ndemby@usgs.gov) no later than 2:00PM EST, Wednesday, November 15, 2017 with an affirmative answer.

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION STATES THE FOLLOWING PART:

The following information is provided to demonstrate the proposed contractor's unique qualifications:

The units are component fiber optic transmitters and receivers that fit into a multi-unit chassis that provides power, monitoring, and interfaces. In spring 2017, a unit failed, which required use of the offline spare unit (shelf spare) to be placed into operations. When the failed unit was evaluated, it was determined that repair was not possible and a procurement was initiated for replacement units. Additional spares and replacement units are being sought to address a concern about multiple-unit failures impacting the ability of the ground station at USGS/EROS to receive Landsat satellite data, as the receivers and transmitters are the key component use to transfer signals between the remotely-located antennas and the rest of the ground station equipment in computer room 2.

Replacement units are sought from the same vendor for compatibility with existing chassis, cabling, and infrastructure to maximize the current investment of approximately $XXXX. While there are functional replacement units available from other vendors, using another vendor would require procurement of not just the transmitters and receivers, but instead would necessitate the procurement of supporting chassis, potential modifications to existing cabling and monitoring systems, as well as the procurement of spare units, which could increase the size of the proposed procurement by at least double. A multi-vendor solution is not possible as the units would not be inter-compatible and multiple parallel systems would be needed, one from each vendor, and there would also be additional costs required to provide multiple sparing for each vendor's equipment in order meet the required station availability requirement.

All required hardware will be additions to equipment currently installed and operational.

These modules must be compatible with existing installed equipment and infrastructure. 

No other resellers are known to exist for this requirement. 

Availability of this requirement has been investigated with the result that only this product can meet the EROS functional and technical requirements noted above.   Competition does not currently exist in the reseller market based on an informal market survey using the internet and industry trade journals (a formal RFI was not conducted as this is a procurement for spares and replacements to fit into an existing system, not a new requirement for a complete system). Additionally, the vendor was contacted to see if the products were available from any authorized resellers, but they only have third-party manufacturers (sales) representatives.

This procurement is expected to be a one-time requirement.  When the infrastructure reaches end of life, the replacement will be competed to the maximum extent practical.

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">1.0&nbsp;Background&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Marine Corps Operating Concept (MOC) describes, in broad terms, how Marine Corps forces will conduct the range of military operations in accordance with established Title 10 responsibilities. It defines the central problem: "<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">The Marine Corps is currently not organized, trained, and equipped to meet the demands of a future operating environment characterized by complex terrain, technology proliferation, information warfare, the need to shield and exploit signatures, and an increasingly non-permissive maritime domain." And, it affirms "The 21st century Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) operates and fights at sea, from the sea, and ashore as an integrated part of the Naval force and the larger Combined/Joint force." The MOC posits a role for the MAGTF in Sea Control that "</span>Marine forces can also support sea control through anti-surface warfare missions and counter-fast attack craft/fast inshore attack craft missions..."</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">2.0 Description</strong></p>
<p>Accordingly the Marine Corps is interested in readily available shore-based, coastal defense capabilities designed to provide precision kinetic fires against ships at ranges of 80 miles or greater. Preferred systems would:</p>

<p>A complete coastal defense system would be composed of a command and control center, and a surveillance and Over the Horizon (OTH) target acquisition capability, in addition to the kinetic launch system. Provide a short narrative on how the proposed system integrates with USMC systems that provide some or all of these functions.</p>

<DESC><p>The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) desires to exchange CCC-owned bulk peanuts for up to 224 trucks of commercial peanut butter. The peanut butter will be in 12/18 ounce containers, produced and packaged in accordance with USDA specification as outlined in Attachment 1, and destined for various US locations. Bidders may submit offers for less than the quantity indicated. CCC may make award to multiple bidders to fulfill the requested quantity.</p>
<p>All CCC-owned bulk peanuts are available for the exchange and will be released in-store at the primary code and location listed on the catalog, using the factors shown on the warehouse receipt(s). Although CCC does not guarantee the quality of the peanuts that will be loaded out, warehouse operators are obligated to deliver the total CCC receipt value of peanuts represented on the warehouse receipt, based on the factors on the warehouse receipt. CCC will not pay the load out charges. Prospective contractors are strongly urged to contact the storing warehouse operator regarding scheduling, quality, and any applicable charges including fumigation and grading/inspection fees. The contractor will be responsible for any fees that apply. Any differences must be settled between the contractor and the warehouse operator.</p>
<p>The warehouse operator is obligated to load out of the advertised location, unless otherwise agreed upon by the contractor. Please be advised that due to the existence of merged agreements, the CCC-owned bulk peanuts may or may not be located in the exact advertised location. However, the warehouse operator is responsible for any freight differential from a location other than the advertised location. CCC may reject any or all offers.</p>
<p>The contractor will specify the line items of commercial peanut butter they are willing to deliver in exchange for any number and combination of available lots of CCC-owned bulk peanuts. No offer on any one catalog lot number will be contingent upon the acceptance of another catalog lot number. Offers on partial lots are unacceptable, lots must be bid on in full. Additionally, offers including partial line items are also unacceptable. If the line item has more than one part (multiple destinations), all parts must be included in the offer. Any differences between the quantity and quality of CCC-owned bulk peanuts received by the contractor are to be settled between the storing warehouse and the contractor. CCC will not facilitate this settlement.</p>
<p>All costs for transportation/manufacturing/handling of peanut butter from the contractor's plant to the final destination are for the contractor's account.</p>
<p>Commercial peanut butter shall be delivered between January 15, 2018 and June 30, 2018, depending on the line item.</p>

<p align="left">COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION NOTICE:</p>
</strong>
<p align="left">This is a combined synopsis/solicitation notice for commercial product/services prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This <strong>announcement </strong>constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation is attached. Solicitation RFQ FA9401-18-R-0003 incorporates provisions and clauses effective through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-95, dated 13 Jan 17. This requirement is set-aside 100% for Small Business. North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 339113 - Vacuum pumps, laboratory-type, manufacturing, with a size standard of 750 employees. All qualified small businesses under this industry are encouraged to submit quotes.</p>
<strong>
<p align="left">DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:</p>
</strong>
<p align="left">The acquisition of the multi-stage roots pumps will provide significant advances to the SEEM program by providing redundancy in an existing DC discharge/flow tube ion source apparatus. The current set-up requires down time to maintain the existing vacuum setup and is subject to extended downtime should a single vacuum pump fail and require repair or replacement. Acquisition of the roots pump allows for continued operation during routine maintenance as well as providing necessary redundancy for these experimental analyses that allow us to measure reaction kinetics and products of chemistry processes as they relate to the ionosphere, re-entry, combustion, solar fuels, and high energy materials. This acquisition will significantly improve the scope and productivity of our research.</p>

<DESC>Description starts with 3.1, no information has been omitted.
<p>3.1. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br /><br />3.2. The solicitation number for this streamlined acquisition is W31P4Q-18-R-0023 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-22. This acquisition is a Small Business Set-Aside (SBSA).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.3. The requirements will be fulfilled using the Simplified Acquisition procedures, Part 13 of the FAR. Individual purchases under this BPA will not exceed the Simplified Acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>3.4. The associated North American Classification System (NAICS) code is 334419. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>3.5. The Army Contracting Command, - Redstone on behalf of the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center's (AMRDEC's) Software Engineering Directorate (SED) intends to establish a constellation of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for the future competitive acquisition of commercial equipment, hardware and software on a SBSA basis within a 60 mile radius of Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. The SED is a center of technical excellence to Service-specific and Joint Service technologies and programs throughout the Department of Defense (DoD) and Other Government Agencies (OGAs). The SED provides a Government test bed for emerging concepts experimentation; architecture development and refinement; rapid prototyping; technology insertion and transition; multi-service weapon system interoperability, systems engineering and integration; modeling/simulation; training; test and evaluation; and Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) optimization in support of Combat Developers, Materiel Developers, Warfighters and other customers including requirements supporting Foreign Military Sales (FMS). The proposed ITECS BPA constellation will support the Software Engineering Directorate and its customers, Army and Other Services' Program Managers, Program Executive Offices, and Other Government Agencies (OGAs) across the lifecycle of supported weapon systems and technology development and integration efforts. The proposed ITECS BPA constellation is used to support Government-direct acquisition of equipment required to accomplish the SED mission. The ITECS BPA constellation is just one acquisition strategy available to the Government for acquiring material needed to accomplish its mission. The Government may also elect to acquire material through services contracts that is the culmination of material adaptation and modification that provides the Government with a turn-key technical solution.</p>
<p>3.6. Following establishment of the ITECS BPA constellation, the U.S. Army Contracting Command reserves the right to compete individual requirements below the simplified acquisition threshold with small businesses, woman owned businesses, HUBZone or Service Disabled Veteran-owned small businesses to accomplish its socio-economic goals.</p>
<p>3.7. The initial BPAs will be issued for a period of six (6) months, with one six (6) month option period and four (4) one-year option periods to renew. The Contracting Command - Redstone reserves the right to cancel any company's BPA for any reason including poor performance and/or if the company's prices are determined to be no longer competitive. In addition, the Army Contracting Command - Redstone may solicit additional companies at any time to replace or increase existing BPAs to fulfill the Army Contracting Command - Redstone's requirements.</p>
<p>3.8. The Government is seeking a centralized vehicle, which offers a wide array of commercial computer hardware and software products, electronic/electrical products, communications equipment and other equipment required to support the SED mission and customers that may be used in developing, acquiring and sustaining new technical capabilities through the integrated use of these products and to fulfill customer requirements.

BPA holders may be required to provide quotations in some instances based on an equipment specification provided by the Government.</p>
<p>3.9. Currently, the Army Contracting Command - Redstone and AMRDEC has access to existing contract vehicles through the USA Communications and Electronics Command (USACECOM) through which it procures Army customer office automation/Information Technology (IT) equipment through the U.S. Army Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (CHESS) Enterprise IDIQ contracts in compliance with SAIS-GKP memorandum, 04 May 09, subject: Use of CHESS as the Primary Source for Procuring Commercial IT Hardware and Software. Specific hardware items that are available through CHESS sources that meet SED specifications for Army requirements will not be ordered through ITECS BPAs resulting from this synopsis and solicitation. Other Services or OGA requirements for IT may be acquired through BPAs awarded through this synopsis and solicitation. Software items for Army requirements that are available through CHESS Enterprise contracts will not be ordered through BPAs resulting from this synopsis and solicitation.</p>
<p>3.10. Following the establishment of the BPAs resulting from this synopsis and solicitation, the Army Contracting Command will compete any future ITECS requirements among a subset of BPA holders, using vendor rotation as determined by the Ordering Officer/Contracting Officer. In accordance with AFARS 5113.303-1, the Government reserves the right to conduct Reverse Auctions. Exact future requirements are not known at this time and there is no guarantee of requirements in the future. Future requirement Call Orders will be identified by a Call Order numbering system determined by the Government. BPA holders selected through the BPA Holder vendor rotation established by the Ordering Officer/Contracting Officer will be notified electronically of new Call Order requirements through the issuance of a Call Order Request for Quotation (RFQ) email from either the Ordering Officer/Contracting Officer, identifying by the part number, description, quantity, required delivery date and date/time for submission of the quotation. The BPA contractors shall submit through the forum identified in the Call Order RFQ email its quotation for price and delivery in response to the Call Order RFQ. The Contracting Officer or their designated Ordering Officer shall specify the Call Order Quotation response time for each Call Order RFQ dependent upon the size, complexity and urgency of the requirement. Failure to submit a complete and timely response to a BPA Call Order RFQ may result in it being determined non-responsive to the Call Order RFQ and may serve as the basis for reduced use of the contractor during subsequent vendor rotation or cancellation of the BPA in it entirety. The award of all Call Orders issued under BPAs established through this solicitation and synopsis will be based on best value, considering price and delivery and will be for the entire Call Order requirement unless otherwise specified by the Contracting Officer. Contractors submitting a timely response and adequate documentation required in response to this synopsis and solicitation, and to whom a BPA is ultimately awarded, agree to waive their right to protest the award of all future Call Orders. Following issuance of a specific Call Order to the BPA Holder, that contractor shall assume responsibility for (1) providing within 3 working days an email to the ITECS Ordering Officer/Contracting Officer, verifying that the ITECS BPA Holder has issued the necessary Purchase Order(s) for all required equipment and providing in that email a copy of its vendor Purchase Order(s) with the line item. The ITECS BPA Holder is responsible for updating the appropriate ITECS Ordering Officer regarding changes in vendor delivery schedules that exceed Call Order delivery dates and will be reflected in the contractor's past performance assessment. All BPA Holders determined under this synopsis and solicitation will be required to bill and accept payment through both the Government Purchase Card and the Government's Wide Area Work Flow iRAPT system. It is currently planned that actions with a value up to $150,000 will be processed by the Ordering Officer. The Contracting Officer may also elect in some instances to issue ITECS Delivery Orders against the respective ITECS BPA.</p>
<p>3.11 Place of delivery will vary, but most deliveries will go to the</p>
<p>U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command<br />JSIL ATTN: RDMR-BAJ/Rita Owens 256-876-8830<br />BLDG 6263<br />Hackberry Road<br />Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5280</p>
<p>However, the Government may require delivery at other CONUS and OCONUS locations. The delivery location will be specified in each Call Order RFQ issued under the authority of the BPA.</p>
<p>3.12. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. In addition, Offerors are required to submit through email, by the date and time specified below, the following information in response to this synopsis and solicitation:</p>

<p>(2) Contractor certification that it will accept payment for ITECS equipment acquired through any BPA Call Order(s) for each Call Order executed against its BPA through a Government Credit Card and thru Wide Area Work Flow iRAPT.</p>
<p>(3) The contractor will be required to identify the location of its corporate address to verify through its response to this synopsis and solicitation that is within a 60 mile radius of Redstone Arsenal, AL as determined by the Contracting Officer. All responses to this synopsis and solicitation provided by contractors determined to be outside this radius will be non-responsive to the requirements of the synopsis/solicitation and not evaluated for subsequent award. The determination of the Government concerning the mile radius of Redstone Arsenal, AL is under the sole purview of the Contracting Officer and may be disputed by the contractor determined to be not within the 60 mile radius, but will not be the basis of restraining the issuance of BPAs to otherwise successful contractors. Contractors determined by the Contracting Officer to be within the required 60 mile radius of Redstone Arsenal, AL, may not be disputed by other contractors.</p>
<p>(4) Contractor certification that it is registered in System for Award Management (SAM) and that at the time of its response to this synopsis and solicitation that it is compliant with the synopsis and solicitation NAICS Code.</p>
<p>(5) The contractor shall furnish in its email response to this synopsis and solicitation a digital copy of a letter of credit from its banking institution furnished on banking institution letter head and signed by an authorized representative of that institution identifying in whole U.S. dollars the amount of the contractor's line of credit.</p>

<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: The Savannah District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers requires the services of Architect-Engineer (A-E) firms for a minimum of one and a maximum of three multidiscipline Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for general design services on large projects. These contracts are being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act, as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. All Architects and Engineers (A-E), including subcontractors, are cautioned to review the restrictions of FAR 9.5 Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest and 36.209 - Construction Contracts with Architect-Engineer Firms. Any A-E, including subcontractors, that prepares a Design-Build Request for Proposal for a particular project will be restricted from participating in any contractor task order for the Design-Build of that particular project. Firms will be selected for negotiations based on demonstrated competence for the required work. Contracts may be issued up to one year after selection approval. Offerors are cautioned to read this announcement in its entirety. Contracts awarded as a result of this announcement will be administered by Savannah District for use on federal projects under its jurisdiction and if requested other Corps of Engineers Districts. Typically, the contract will be for one basic ordering period (three years) and one option period (two years) with a total contract limit of five years or $20,000,000. Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed price task orders. Task Orders will be primarily for large projects with a construction value greater than $2 million, however as required, smaller projects will be executed under these contracts. These task orders are firm fixed price. Projects to be designed are not yet determined and funds are not presently available. Assignment of individual task orders to the contracts with identical scopes of work will be based on the following factors: (1) Performance and quality of deliverables under the current IDC, (2) Current capacity of the firm to accomplish the task order in the required time, and (3) Equitable distribution of work among identical contracts. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541330 size standard $15.0 million. This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size. Small businesses are encouraged to team with other businesses. The firm must be capable of responding to and working on multiple task orders concurrently. Large business firms that intend to do any subcontracting must convey their intent to meet the minimum small business goals on the SF 330, Section C, by identifying subcontracting opportunities with small business. If selected, the large business offeror will be required to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9 and DFARS 219.7004 as part of the Request for Proposal package. The following subcontracting goals are the minimum acceptable goals to be included in the subcontracting plan to meet the Savannah District small business targets. Of the subcontracted work, 50% of the work would go to small business; 17% to small disadvantaged business (a composite of small business); 18% to women-owned business (a composite of small business); 10% to HUBZone small business (a composite of small business); 4% to service-disabled veteran-owned small business (a composite of small business and veteran-owned small business); and 8.5% to Veteran-owned small business (a composite of small business). The small business subcontracting plan will be evaluated in accordance with AFARs Subpart 5119.7 and AFARS Appendix DD. The plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations. To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM).

<p><br />8. 25.101 BUY AMERICA ACT</p>
<p>(a) The Buy American Act restricts the purchase of supplies that are not domestic end products. For manufactured end products, the Buy American Act uses a two-part test to define a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(1) The article must be manufactured in the United States; and</p>
<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>
<p>(b) The Buy American Act applies to small business set-asides. A manufactured product of a small business concern is a U.S.-made end product, but is not a domestic end product unless it meets the component test in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103. The unreasonable cost exception is implemented through the use of an evaluation factor applied to low foreign offers that are not eligible offers. The evaluation factor is not used to provide a preference for one foreign offer over another. Evaluation procedures and examples are provided in Subpart 25.5.</p>

NAS operates the primary HPC facility in support of all NASA mission areas, whereas the NCCS primarily supports the Science Mission Directorate (SMD).&nbsp; Users of both facilities are broadly distributed across most NASA Centers and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), numerous partner organizations, including other federal agencies, universities, corporations, and other organizations performing work for or with NASA. NASA/ARC and GSFC will consolidate the NAS and NCCS requirements. The consolidated requirement will be known as the NASA Advanced Computing Services (NACS).&nbsp; The consolidation of requirements will enhance best value to NASA by reducing transaction costs, ensure a streamlined acquisition, and improve the overall effectiveness of NACS services. NACS defines the scope of activities required to support advanced computing services for NASA.&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to supporting the NAS at ARC and the NCCS at GSFC, the NACS may be used to provide advanced computing services to other NASA Centers and the JPL as required by the Government.&nbsp; The primary advanced computing service provided by both NAS and the NCCS is high performance computing (HPC, also known as supercomputing, high end computing, or HEC). Other areas, including high-end applications, data-intensive computing, collaborative computing, and emerging computing paradigms (such as quantum computing) are becoming increasingly important services. In addition, NACS will support NASA mission-driven science and engineering using these advanced computing services.</span></p>

<DESC>Attached are questions and answers received from interested parties at the process demonstration at Gradient Technologies on 3 October 2017 and pictures of the equipment discussed.
<p>Based on the information provided by the U.S. Government regarding the potential procurement for the demil and disposal of various Navy Projectiles and Cartridges, we request input on the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Would your company prefer the U.S. Government to include the equipment that was demonstrated at Gradient Technologies on 3 October 2017 for your use during performance of this contract? This equipment would be offered as Government Furnished Property (GFP) and all applicable clauses would apply, to include, but not limited to, FAR 52.247-55, DFARS 252.211-7007, and DFARS 252.245-7001. The rental charge shall be calculated in accordance with FAR 52.245-9(e)(3).</p>
<p><br />2. As briefed at the Industry Day on 07 June 2017 the U.S. Government intends include three CLIN Groups in the possible solicitation to all be awarded at the same time. If a contractor would be the successful awarded for more than one CLIN Group they would be expected to complete ALL awarded CLIN groups within the same period of performance which is typically 12-18 months after award date. The following CLIN Groups are intended to be included in the possible solicitation:</p>
<p>CLIN GROUP 1:<br />16 inch Projectile</p>
<p>CLIN GROUP 2:<br />3 inch Cartridge<br />90 mm Cartridge<br />6 inch Projectile<br />8 inch Projectile</p>
<p>CLIN GROUP 3:<br />5 inch Projectile</p>
<p>The Government is contemplating restructure of the solicitation to allow two, SEQUENTIAL closing dates and awards.</p>
<p>For instance, the U.S. Government would request/evaluate proposals and award contracts(s) for the demil of entire quantity of the assets under CLIN GROUPS 2 and 3 at one-time, upfront buy. Then, at a later date (approximately 6-9 months later), the U.S. Government would request/evaluate proposals and award contract(s) for the 16-inch projectiles in CLIN Group 1 with later deliveries.</p>
<p>Would this action benefit/burden your company? If so, please provide your rationale to include potential impact (in general terms) to your overall, aggregate proposal in terms of cost , schedule, or performance. Also provide any concerns/recommendations you might have.</p>
<p>Please have responses submitted to Bridget Kramer (Bridget.L.Kramer.civ@mail.mil) no later than 3:00PM CT on 13 November 2017.</p>

<DESC>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. <br /><br />The proposed sole source contract action is for an additional 18 months of period of performance for Tactical Airspace Integration System (TAIS) and TAIS Airspace Workstation (AWS) Engineering Services (ES) and Performance Based Logistics (PBL) beginning 01 July 2018 and ending 31 December 2019. The contract action will bridge the capabilities gap from the current TAIS contract (W58RGZ-14-C-003) and a new competitive contract which is anticipated to be awarded in Fiscal Year 2019. This contract action will be procured from General Dynamics C4 Systems (GDC4S), 6000 Technology Drive, Building 6, Huntsville, AL 35805 (CAGE 1VN18), who is the incumbent contractor, pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." It is anticipated that any source other than GDC4S would not be viable for this one-time bridge effort due to unacceptable delays in fulfilling mission requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All questions may be directed to Katherine Cubelic, Contract Specialist, email katherine.p.cubelic.civ@mail.mil or Angela Hodges, Contracting Officer, email angela.d.hodges2.civ@mail.mil. <br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item with 15 days of this notice. The required quantity is 1,092 EA with no option shipping to (SW3227) Red River, TX 75507-5000. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This solicitation is being issued under the First Destination Transportation (FDT) program.

Hard copies of this solicitation are not available. There are no technical drawings/bid sets available. This solicitation is not set aside for small business. While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance, Socioeconomic and Ability One. The required delivery is 172 days. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the US by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979.

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision.

The buildings will be capable of withstanding ballistic impacts from projectiles, explosive fragments and repetitive breaching at designated points in the building walls and roofs.  Power will be provided to each building to support lighting, video monitoring, sound and other equipment similar to the existing facilities.  A new, permanent Range Control Building will also be constructed near the main entry to the compound for control, safety and monitoring activities on the SATEC.  This building will include space for range control, VIP briefing, computer servers, classroom, staging, restrooms and target fabrication and material storage.
  Information systems include basic telephone, computer network, fiber optic, cable television, security and fire alarm system and infrastructure.  Built-in equipment includes an air compressor for shop air equipment and flag pole for display of operational warning flags for the compound. 

Site improvements will include expansion of the gravel roadway network in the central urban area to encompass the new training building.  In addition, a network of stabilized gravel and dirt roadways will be established around the compound for training and evaluation of methods to defeat improved improvised explosive devices (IEDs) including pedestrian overpasses and culverts crossing under the roadways.

The estimated contract value is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.

To provide additional flexibility and efficiency, the new requirement for Tier I services moves the place of performance to the contractor's facility with NIPRNet and SIPRNet connectivity. Tier II services will still be required to be performed at the Government facilities but it is required to be extended to support all 42 locations.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES <br />Please describe your experience delivering the following capabilities:</p>
<p>1) Service Desk Support Services (Tier I) - provide services at a Contractor's U.S. based primary and secondary (COOP) Facility Clearance at the SECRET level IAW DoD 5220.22, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual. This SECRET level clearance requirement applies to affiliates, team members, subcontractors, etc., that will require access to classified information. All Tier I services provided from the Contractor's US-based primary and secondary (COOP) facilities must have network connectivity to NIPRNet and SIPRNet networks. The contractor's response should confirm that their facility has both NIPR and SIPR access at the time of this sources sought. The contractor's response should also show their ability to provide Service Desk Support on a 24 hour a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year basis to approximately 1.7M users world-wide, either directly or indirectly based on application service level agreement requirements. Most of these users are expected to need Tier 1/Level 1 support and Tier 1 Level 2 support.</p>
<p>These services would support approximately 1,750,000 users across the globe. The current environment operates according to a 'level' and 'tier' support model. The 'levels' represent proximity of Service Desk agents to mission partners/customers, whereas the 'tiers' within those levels represent the different skill sets of the service desk agents. The various Tiers provide support that corresponds with levels of proximity to the end user. Tier I is a virtualized service desk with local support provided by dispatch labor. Touch labor only pertains to the DISA internal support network.</p>
<p>Level 1 represents direct user support; Level 2 represents Service Desk-to-Service Desk support; and Level 3 represents external entities' support to the service desk (e.g. software vendor help desk support to internal service desks). This 'level' and 'tier' support model utilizes an enterprise trouble ticket workflow, an enterprise contact management system and knowledge centered support known as the Service Support Environment.</p>
<p>2) Desktop Support Services (Tier II) - provide touch labor services at the DISA site locations. There are approximately 42 site locations within CONUS and OCONUS.</p>
<p>3) Hire contractor personnel that are citizens of the United States who possess a U.S. Secret Clearance. The contractor must have credible processes that demonstrate a complete and thorough ability to perform complete background checks and security clearances on 100% of contractor personnel.</p>
<p>4) Provide Certified HDI Support Center Analysts</p>
<p>5) Provide certified HDI Desktop Support Technicians (HDI-DST).</p>
<p><br />SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Onsite staff will require at least a minimum Secret Security Clearance with IT-1.</p>
<p>SOURCES SOUGHT: <br />The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541513, with the corresponding size standard of $27.5 million. This Sources Sought Synopsis is requesting responses to the following criteria ONLY from small businesses that can provide the required services under the NAICS Code. <br />To assist DISA in making a determination regarding the level of participation by small business in any subsequent procurement that may result from this Sources Sought, you are also encouraged to provide information regarding your plans to use joint venturing (JV) or partnering to meet each of the requirements areas contained herein.

<DESC><p>a. At the expiration of the existing five year contract, the contract was extended for three months under 52.217-8 in an effort to compete the contract utilizing Commercial Cost Comparison (C3) Solicitation Procedures. A total of commercial proposals and one SourceAmerica proposal were received in response to the solicitation. An initial review of the proposals revealed that five offers complied with the requirement as outlined in Section L of the solicitation, Provision 52.215-4509, Proposal Submission (Format and Content (APR 2004)). The five offers were forwarded to a Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) for evaluation, in accordance with the Section M, Evaluation Factors for Award (Attachment 1). The SourceAmerica proposal remained sealed and in a locked storage location, until such time the cost comparison is conducted. Following the initial review and technical evaluation it was determined that clarificationswere required from multiple proposals. During this time, the contracting activity was also experiencing high turnover, limited manpower, and backlog; thus, reviews and evaluations took longer than expected. It was also necessary to conduct discussionswith offerors, adding additionalprocurement time.</p>
<p>b. Due to the above delays, the requested two-month extension is determined to be in the best interest of the Government to allow for a continuation of services with the incumbent contractor, who is already performing the services at a satisfactory level and who is knowledgeable of all requirements to include existing sufficient staffing, existing negotiated contractual terms and conditions, and performance schedule to continue operationswithout further delay or disruption. Proposal evaluations are currently underway for the anticipated new contract to be awarded in May of 2017. Issuing a new solicitation for this two-month period would present unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Governments requirement for shelf stocking, receiving/storage/holding area, and custodial services at the Fort McCoy Commissary. Disruption of these services would potentially result in a shutdown of the commissary, and thereby negatively impact<br />the service for military members and their families. The time and costs associated with the Government to re-compete a two month effort would not be prudent and would not result in recouped costs over the life of a two month contract. As such, extending the option period for an additional two-month period.</p>

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)
ALL APPROVAL SIGNATURES REDACTED. DJH.

Acquisition Plan Action ID:  VA246-17-AP-9608

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 6 (NCO 6), on behalf of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) in Salisbury, North Carolina in support of purchase request number 659-18-1-064-0012.
 
Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: This Justification provides the rationale for contracting by other than full and open competition for an FY18 standing order for consumables (reagents, test kits) to be used in antibody-tagging testing at VAMC Salisbury s Pathology and Laboratory Service.  

This procurement is for consumables specified above is conducted in accordance with FAR 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items and specifically FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements, where acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2. 

Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs:  VAMC Salisbury recently purchased a Roche Diagnostics brand pathology analyzing equipment: Benchmark ULTRA fully automated slide preparation system; Ventana HE600 analyzer; Vantage analyzer; and V-Connect software. The equipment requires consumables (reagents, antibodies, and supplies) to process the tests. The estimated annual FY18 cost of the consumables is $250,000.00.

This procurement will be awarded to Roche Diagnostics Corporation, 9115 Hague Road, Indianapolis, IN 46256.

Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

 (X)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
 (  )   (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
 (  )   (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
         or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
 (  )   (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
 (  )   (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
 (  )   (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
 (  )   (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

 The authority for applying the Simplified Procedures for Commercial Items of FAR 12.5 is 41 U.S.C.  1901 and is implemented by restricting competition on this procurement via FAR 13.106(b)(2).

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  
Roche Diagnostics Corporation is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the stated slide preparation equipment and all associated consumables (reagents and test kits).  This equipment is highly specialized and the consumables are extremely sensitive to transportation, heat, and time.  To guarantee the reagents  quality integrity is maintained, Roche Diagnostics Corporation does not use distributors.  This allows for the replacement of any consumable directly and expeditiously if performance is not maintained at 100% acceptability.  Additionally, these consumables are specifically designed for the stated equipment; use of any other type of consumables may result in standardization errors and misdiagnosis of tissue samples. Use of other type of consumables would also void all equipment warranties and product liability regulations.  As such, only Roche Diagnostics Corporation can satisfy the requirement.

Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  An Intent to Sole Source Notice will be published on FedBizOpps; however, no responses are anticipated.  Due to the organic/chemical composition and sensitivity of the consumables, Roche Diagnostics Corporation does not allow distribution rights in effort to maintain quality assurance.

Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The estimated cost to the Government for this requirement is $250,000.00 for an annual supply of consumables; Roche Diagnostics Corporation has previously provided quantity discounts to the Government and is anticipated to provide the same for this requirement.  Previous procurements for this requirement have been reviewed and compared to the current estimated cost, and it is therefore determined the cost to the Government for this requirement is fair and reasonable.

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Internet searches, along with FSS Schedule 66 searches, indicate Roche Diagnostics Corporation is the only distributor of the required consumables.  Additionally, a search of NAICS 325413 provided 18 SD/VOSBs, however, Roche Diagnostics Corporation provided a written statement of their policy regarding not using distributors regardless of socio-economic status.

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  There are no other facts supporting this request for Justification other than those previously stated.

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  See Section 6 above.

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  There are no actions which may be taken to overcome barriers to competition for this requirement.

<DESC>This notice of intent is being advertised to inform interested parties that the Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center intends to award a sole source IDIQ contract to American Home Medical Equipment Company, LLC, a Women-Owned Small Business.  The contract is for a four month bridge for the Lebanon VAMC.  The proposed creation of a Fixed Price Indefinite Quantity, Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) contract for Home Oxygen services is to allow for review, evaluation, and award of a new VISN Contract that will be completed shortly.

Due to the size and complexity of the new competitive procurement, the Lebanon VAMC Home
Oxygen will be extended with the incumbent contractor, American Home Medical Equipment
Company, under a bridge contract for four months. The current contract expires October 31, 2017.  This bridge is being executed to avoid disruption in home oxygen services provided for the Lebanon VA Medical Center in Lebanon, PA.   It includes all required supplies, materials, labor, supervision, transportation, patient education, and safety management and infection control for at-home oxygen-using patients.

<DESC>This sole source acquisition is to continue the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 2's Regional Oversight Contract IV (ROC-4) that provides technical support services to ensure environmental compliance of Federal Facilities, which is required by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), its amendment in 1986 and 1992, and the Federal Facilities Compliance Act (FFCA). 

A class Justification for Full and Open Competition (JOFOC) was published on May 12, 2017 (Notice No. SOL-HQ-17-00009) explaining the purpose of extending five existing contracts to allow the Agency time to implement the new suites of the Remedial Acquisition Framework (RAF) contracts. The ROC-4 (Contract No. EP-S2-12-02) is one of the five contracts that are being extended. The ROC-4 is a single-award indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract that was awarded to TechLaw, Inc. and is set to expire on January 6, 2018. The acquisition provided for full and open competition after exclusion of other than small business concerns. The proposed modification bridges the existing contract to the new competitively multiple-award IDIQ contracts being solicited under Request for Proposal No. SOL-R1-14-00001, Environmental Services & Operations, which was released on February 26, 2016 and the proposals were due back on April 15, 2016. Due to the complexity of the proposal evaluation process, the anticipated award date for these replacement contracts have been delayed. This proposed bridge extension is for a period of performance of up to 36 months (one 12-month base period with one 12-month option period and two 6-month option periods) and will prevent an adverse impact on the mission of the agency, which would occur with the interruption of the work presently performed. The performance work statement and the labor categories under the bridge modification remains the same as under the current contract.

FAR PART 8.405-6 - ORDER >$150,000

Acquisition Plan Action ID:  VA261-17-AP-10902 / 459-18-105-0010  

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 21, Pacific Islands Healthcare System Medical Center, Honolulu, HI 96819.

Description of Action: This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program (41 U.S.C. 251 and 40 U.S.C. 501).  This is a new requirement for the Lease of a Hematology analyzer w/Supplies & Service Agreement.

Name of Proposed Contractor:
Sysmex America Inc.

Description of Supplies or Services:
The estimated value of the proposed action is $37,425.60 (total including options $206,800.00). The laboratory needs to lease the hematology analyzer on a cost per reportable result basis. The model is Sysmex XN-1000 to include a cart. This item is peculiar to one manufacture and no other companies are allowed to sell directly to the medical center. The period of performance is one base and four option years.
(4) IDENTIFY THE AUTHORITY AND SUPPORTING RATIONALE (see 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A), (B), and (C) or 8.405-6(b)), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

 An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 

 Only one source can provide the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. The medical center is using another company s analyzer and are not satisfied with the results. It regularly breaks down and has proven itself unreliable. Parts are difficult to obtain and require long lead times because the depot is on the east coast. The lab also doesn t have a backup analyzer to use when the current one needs to be repaired which effects patient care. The current equipment s technology has not been updated in years and other hospitals are also switching because of this.

This vendor has been awarded a BPA for VISN 21 for analyzers, however the Honolulu Lab was not included. To ensure uniformity among medical centers, Honolulu is requesting this be awarded to Sysmex.

 In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 

 Items peculiar to one manufacturer: 

 A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.) 

 These are  direct replacements  parts/components for existing equipment.  

 The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.404(d) TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  

This order will represent the best value because for the price of equipment that is not reliable, the medical center can receive the most recent technology and reliability.


(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:

Market research was conducted and several other companies that provide analyzers were reviewed. Other hospitals were contacted along with the contracting department. Past Performance of other models were considered. There are no SDVOSB/VOSB/SBs allowed to sell directly to the hospitals.

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION: This is not a set-aside so the Non-Manufacturing Rule and Limitations on Subcontracting rule will not apply.

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:

There are no actions that the contracting office can take to remove or overcome any barriers. The barriers have been created by the company due to equipment failures and by other company s restrictions on allowing distributors to sell directly to a hospital.

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.  (This signature is the requestor s supervisor, fund control point official, chief of service or someone with responsibility and accountability.)

Jodi Liao, Chief, Laboratory Services: [SEE SIGNED ATTACHMENT]


(10)  APPROVALS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE VHAPM Part 806.3 OFOC SOP:  

a.  CONTRACTING OFFICER S CERTIFICATION (required):   I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.


 Shannon Reid, Contract Specialist: [SEE SIGNED ATTACHMENT]

b.  One Level Above the Contracting Officer (Required over$150K but not exceeding $700K): I certify the justification meets requirements for other than full and open competition.


Paul Griffin, Director of Contracting (Acting): [SEE SIGNED ATTACHMENT]
