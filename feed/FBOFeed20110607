The performance period will be extended for a maximum of nine (9) months(August 1, 2011-March 31, 2012), consisting of one six (6) month base performance periodand three (3) one-month option periods. The exercise of each option period will bedetermined by the Government on a monthly basis. A contract modification reflecting thisextension and resultant increase in the estimated Cost Plus-Award Fee (CPAF)of thecontract will be issued on or before August 1, 2011, the expiration date of the currentfire prevention services contract.Contract NNA06CD65C, which was awarded as a result of full and open competition on June28, 2006 with an effective contract date of July 1, 2006, provides fire protectionservices to the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) facilities, the Ames Research CenterCampus, Ames Research Center East Side, NASA Research Park (NRP) the UniversityAffiliated Research Center (UARC), Moffett Federal Airfield and Moffett Community Housing(Orion Park Community). These services, consisting of the emergency response, technical,and support services provided by a fire department or fire service provider include, butare not limited to, the following: Control and extinguishment of hostile fire involvingbuildings, structures, vehicles, transportation equipment, vegetation, refuse, andmiscellaneous properties; aircraft rescue fire-fighting; technical rescue; emergencymedical services; hazardous material response, fire prevention and code enforcement; fireinvestigation; fire-rescue automatic and mutual aid; resource management; emergencyapparatus/vehicle maintenance and repair; training and education; fire/life safety publiceducation/awareness and community relations; contract management and administrativeservices; management of records; emergency management/disaster preparedness.This extension is necessary to maintain the current critical fire protection servicesuntil the current procurement process for the follow-on contract has been completed and anew contract awarded. Because Wackenhut Services Inc. provides unique expertise inmeeting the fire protection requirements of the Center, no alternate source couldadequately provide for the maintenance of the Centers fire prevention program duringthis brief extension period. Award to another source during the  current procurementphase of the follow-on contract would result not only in substantial duplication of costto the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, but alsounacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirement.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice<br>The U.S. Army Contracting Command Aberdeen Proving Grounds (ACC-APG) Natick Division is providing notice that a Request for Proposal (RFP), W911QY-11-R-0039, for the delivery of a current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) trivalent filovirus vaccine using the Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) Replicon Particle (VRP) system will be issued on or about 22 June 2011 with an anticipated contract award on or about 18 October 2011.    This is a full and open competition and all responsible or qualified sources are eligible to compete. <br>In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, all interested contractors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  CCR registration can be accomplished at the following website:  http://www.ccr.gov. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this procurement are 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology.  The Government does not intend to use FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.  <br>The Government intends to serve as the regulatory sponsor and system integrator for this effort.<br>The objective of this procurement is to deliver, after limited advance development, a current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) trivalent filovirus vaccine using the Government Licensed Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) Replicon Particle (VRP) system that will be suitable/acceptable for use in humans by the Government to support non-clinical and Phase 1 studies under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. The manufacturer shall develop, abide by and document cGMP and processes consistent with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Q7 guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practice Guide for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, FDA regulation 21 CFR Part 211-cGMP for Finished Pharmaceuticals, and 21 CFR Part 600.  In addition to delivering a cGMP final vaccine product to support clinical and nonclinical efforts, the Contractor shall conduct formulation studies to support the development of a trivalent vaccine as well as analytical assay development, including in-process and release assays of cGMP bulk(s) and final product, and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)-compliant stability testing.  The small scale manufacturing process developed must be scalable and transferrable to another facility, if necessary.  <br>The viral glycoprotein genes from each strain shall be cloned into a cGMP compliant optimized VEE replicon vector.  The replicon technology is derived from an attenuated strain of the VEE virus, V3014. Specific pathogen genes of interest are inserted as replacements for VEE virus structural genes, thereby making the particle replication defective.  Note: The initial manufacturing efforts must be conducted at BioSafety Level (BSL) 3.  Downstream processing can occur at BSL-2 following negative testing results for live virus. <br>Proposals will be evaluated based on Factors, Subfactors, and Elements representing the "Best Value" to the Government.  Delivery schedules of the vaccine product shall be proposed by the offerors and will be used as one of the criteria associated with a Best Value evaluation. Proposed schedule calling for delivery of the Trivalent Filovirus Vaccine, as described above, is anticipated within 3 to 4 years after contract award, but all proposed delivery schedules will be evaluated.  All interested parties can view, download, and print a copy of the solicitation and any resulting amendments when released on or about 22 June 2011 at the FedBizOpps website hyperlink https://www.fbo.gov/.  Search on solicitation number W911QY-11-R-0039.  No paper copies of the RFP will be provided and no mailing list will be maintained because the acquisition will be posted on the above website.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to award a requirement for several induction brazing units on either a single or multiple award basis.   Induction brazing equipment is used when two or more materials are joined together by a filler metal that has a lower melting point than the base materials using induction heating. In induction heating, usually ferrous materials are heated rapidly from the electromagnetic field that is created by the alternating current from an induction coil.  Common industries utilizing such specialized equipment include:  Automobile Industries, Aerospace engineering, Aviation, Cable and Wire, Forging, Machine Tool, Electrical and Electronics, Rubber and Plastics, Metallurgical Laboratories, Shipbuilding, Tube and Pipe applications.  The vast majority of commercial units are in labs or on assembly lines.   The pending Government requirement is different in that required units must be fully and easily portable so to enable the user to carry the units to remote locations or logistically challenging site.   Examples of some tentative required features per unit include the following:

UNIT 1:

Brazing together two bars joined by a series clip with a typical dimensions of each bar  3.000" x 0.750" or smaller
Main cable length no less than 30 ft. (9 meters approximately) (source/control to brazing head)
If necessary, cooling water will be supplied but only by the available water at the jobsite(s) (typical; ambient temperature tap water, not chilled, not filtered).
The unit must be shippable/portable and rugged enough to withstand repeated freight and truck shipping without incurring damage.
A custom designed head is to be included with the unit.

UNIT 2:

Operate from a 60 Hz source with a supply voltage of 120 Vac (single phase), 208/240 Vac (single phase), or 480 Vac (single or three phase).
Operating frequency minimum range 10 to 25 kHz or other frequency suitable for joining copper conductors as shown in Figure 1 (typical dimensions 0.400" x 0.150" or smaller).
Adjustable power output.
Continuous (100%) duty cycle.
Minimum ambient operating temperature range of 32-120 degrees Fahrenheit
Self-tuning (impedance matching) for custom made heads.
To be used for large hydrogenerator stator winding repair where  coil splices are to be performed.      Brazing together multiple layers of strands
Main cable length no less than 16 ft. (5 meters) (source/control to brazing head), but 20-30 ft. is preferred
If necessary, cooling water will be supplied but only by the available water at the jobsite(s) (typical; ambient temperature tap water, not chilled, not filtered).
The unit must be shippable/portable and rugged enough to withstand repeated air freight and truck shipping without incurring damage.
Must be able to braze four copper conductors together (lap joint), each with the average dimensions of 0.400"x0.150" (as shown in Figure 1, typical)

<DESC>THIS IS A SPECIAL NOTICE.
REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTERESTLONG-TERM MANAGEMENT AND STORAGE OF ELEMENTAL MERCURY
I.  OBJECTIVE OF THE REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST.  NO PROPOSALS ARE ALLOWED.  
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking Expressions of Interest from the private sector regarding potential locations for a facility or facilities where DOE can store and manage elemental mercury pursuant to the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 (the Act).  The Act directs DOE to designate by January 1, 2010, a facility or facilities of DOE for the long-term management and storage of elemental mercury.  At least one such facility must be operational by January 1, 2013.
DOE intends to initiate an Environmental Impact Statement in early 2009 and seeks to identify facilities to consider as potential alternatives.  Accordingly, respondents to this Request for Expressions of Interest may have the facilities they identify considered during the environmental review scoping process.  The environmental review will also analyze the potential environmental impacts of storing elemental mercury at one or more DOE or other Federal facilities.
This Request for Expressions of Interest is for planning purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals.
II.  GENERAL INFORMATION
The Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 prohibits the export of elemental mercury from the United States effective January 1, 2013.  To ensure that elemental mercury is managed and stored safely, the Act directs DOE to take a number of actions.  By October 1, 2009, DOE must issue guidance establishing standards and procedures for the receipt, management and long-term storage of elemental mercury generated within the United States at a facility or facilities of DOE.  DOE must designate such facilities by January 1, 2010, but is prohibited by the Act from locating such a facility at DOE's Oak Ridge Reservation.  At least one such facility must be operational by January 1, 2013.  
In addition to the standards and procedures referenced above, elemental mercury managed and stored at a designated facility will be subject to the requirements of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)), 42 U.S.C. ? 6901 et seq.  A designated facility in existence on or before January 1, 2013, is authorized to operate under interim status pursuant to RCRA section 3005(e), 42 U.S.C. ? 6925(e), until a final decision on a permit application is made pursuant to RCRA section 3005(c), 42 U.S.C. ? 6925(c).  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or an authorized State, shall issue a final decision on the permit application by January 1, 2015.
Currently elemental mercury in the United States comes from several sources, including mercury used in the chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing process, mercury reclaimed from recycling and waste recovery activities, and mercury generated as a byproduct of the gold mining process.  In a November 2007 "Mercury Storage Costs Estimates" report, EPA assumed the total amount of excess mercury supply from commercial sources that would require storage to be between 7,500 and 10,000 metric tons over 40 years.  The 7,500 metric ton scenario assumes that approximately 1,200 metric tons would come from mercury cell chlor-alkali plants, approximately 2,050 metric tons would come from product recycling and waste recovery, and approximately 4,250 metric tons would be a byproduct of gold mining.  The 10,000 metric ton scenario assumes that an additional 2,500 metric tons would result from imports.  There are uncertainties associated with these estimates, and DOE anticipates updating thes e estimates in conjunction with its activities to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
In addition, DOE currently stores approximately 1,200 metric tons of elemental mercury at its Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee.  Also, the Department of Defense (DOD) stores approximately 4,400 metric tons at various locations.  At this time, no decision has been made as to how much elemental mercury from DOE or DOD would be stored in the DOE-designated facilities required by the Act.
As required by Council on Environmental Quality and DOE NEPA regulations, DOE's designation of facilities for the purpose of long-term management and storage of elemental mercury generated in the United States must include consideration of the range of reasonable management and storage alternatives and the environmental impacts of those alternatives.  The purpose of this Request is to determine if there is interest on the part of commercial entities in proposing locations for long-term DOE management and storage facilities.  Identification of such facilities will enable DOE to consider them for potential inclusion in its NEPA review.
Consideration of a facility in the environmental review process is not a guarantee of its selection.  Proposed sites and facilities will be reviewed against a series of technical screening criteria to consider their suitability for a long-term elemental mercury management and storage mission.  In addition, in accordance with NEPA implementing regulations, DOE will conduct public outreach, such as a scoping meeting or meetings, for those sites and facilities considered to be reasonable alternatives, to allow the public to comment.
III.  REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST: 
THIS IS A REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST.  NO PROPOSALS ARE ALLOWED.  
DOE intends to consider a range of reasonable alternatives, including existing and new DOE facilities, in its selection process.  DOE is in the process of conducting an inventory of its national complex to determine potential alternative facilities.  Likewise, DOE is also seeking by this action expressions of interest from commercial entities on locations and facilities for the long-term management and storage of elemental mercury.  Because the Act states that this mercury would be stored at a "facility or facilities of [DOE]", DOE would work, as necessary, with the commercial entity on acquiring an appropriate interest in the facility prior to site designation.  
DOE plans to review each submission to determine if it should be included as a reasonable alternative in DOE's NEPA analysis, which will assess the environmental impacts of each alternative, including existing and new DOE facilities, as they relate to the long-term storage and management of elemental mercury.
As noted above, the amount of mercury to be stored is not well defined.  The size requirements for long-term storage and management facilities will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of elemental mercury ultimately received and the storage configuration of the elemental mercury containers.  Based on currently available information, for planning purposes DOE is looking for locations with one or more existing facilities with a total of approximately 20,000 to 100,000 square feet of storage space, or locations where such facilities could be constructed.  DOE anticipates refining the estimate of required storage space during the environmental review process.  DOE also requires that the facilities be in compliance with all current building codes and construction standards, be located in a geologically stable area (e.g., not in a flood plain or seismically-active zone), and be operated and maintained with appropriate security measures in place.  In addition, the Ac t requires that the facilities obtain and operate in accordance with a RCRA hazardous waste facility permit.
IV.  AREAS TO ADDRESS IN SUBMISSION
DOE requires the following information for each potential storage location and facility:
1.	Name of the company making the Expression of Interest, including a contact person's name, telephone number, and email address;2.	Company address;3.	Company size (please specify as either Large, Small, Small Disadvantaged, Woman Owned Small Business, Veteran Owned Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, 8(a), Hubzone Small Business or other);4.	Name of the city and state in which each potential facility is or would be located;5.	A site map showing the location of the potential storage building or buildings on the site, as well as nearby (within 10 miles) political (e.g., city, county) boundaries, communities (especially minority, low income or Native American), roads, railroads, airports, and water bodies, wetlands, floodplains, parkland, known fault lines or other environmentally sensitive areas;6.	A description of the potential site, including ownership, current activities, access control system, hazardous materials handling experience, mercury handling experience, current tenants, existing permits, previous regulatory compliance problems, and existing environmental contamination; and 7.	A description of the potential storage building, if pre-existing, including date and type of construction, floor condition, any special features that provide protection against leaks and external environmental hazards, fire suppression system, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system, access control system, current activities and materials in storage, current tenants, and existing environmental contamination.
If available, Expressions of Interest should also identify equipment, materials, and labor required to upgrade or construct the potential facility to accept elemental mercury for long-term management and storage, as well as any environmental, health and safety approvals that will be required by Federal, state or local law.
V.  FORMAT
The length of the Expression of Interest should be no more than 20 pages using 12-point font.  Although each respondent may determine how best to organize the Expression of Interest, DOE recommends the following format: Section 1 -- Summary; and Section 2 -- Description of Location with specific reference to the items requested by DOE above. 
DOE reserves the right to use any and all information submitted by, or obtained from, an interested party in any manner DOE determines is appropriate.  An interested party should avoid including any business confidential and/or proprietary information in its Expression of Interest.  However, if an interested party must submit such information, the information must be clearly marked accordingly, and the interested party must provide sufficient justification as to why such information is business confidential and/or proprietary.  DOE will review said information and handle it in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. ? 552) and all applicable Federal law.  
This Request for Expressions of Interest is not a formal solicitation requesting proposals and does not represent a commitment by DOE to award a contract.  This Request for Expressions of Interest does not confer any commitment or obligation from DOE.  Under no circumstances does this Request for Expressions of Interest seek to award a contract for services under the Federal Acquisition Regulations or a financial assistance agreement under Part 600 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations.  
DOE does not intend to formally respond to information submitted in response to this Request for Expressions of Interest.  
The cost for the preparation and submittal of a response to the Request for Expressions of Interest is the sole responsibility of the interested party.  
VI.  SUBMISSION DEADLINE

Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan 
1. PURPOSE
This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) provides a systematic method to evaluate performance for the stated contract.  This QASP explains the following:
"	What will be monitored.
"	How monitoring will take place.
"	Who will conduct the monitoring.
"	How monitoring efforts and results will be documented.

This QASP does not detail how the contractor accomplishes the work.  Rather, the QASP is created with the premise that the contractor is responsible for management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract.  It is the Government's responsibility to be objective, fair, and consistent in evaluating performance. 
This QASP is a "living document" and the Government may review and revise it on a regular basis.  However, the Government shall coordinate changes with the contractor.  Copies of the original QASP and revisions shall be provided to the contractor and Government officials implementing surveillance activities.
2. GOVERNMENT ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The following personnel shall oversee and coordinate surveillance activities.  
a. Contracting Officer (CO) - The CO shall ensure performance of all necessary actions for effective contracting, ensure compliance with the contract terms, and shall safeguard the interests of the United States in the contractual relationship.  The CO shall also assure that the contractor receives impartial, fair, and equitable treatment under this contract. The CO is ultimately responsible for the final determination of the adequacy of the contractor's performance.
b. Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) - The COTR is responsible for technical administration of the contract and shall assure proper Government surveillance of the contractor's performance. The COTR shall keep a quality assurance file.  The COTR is not empowered to make any contractual commitments or to authorize any contractual changes on the Government's behalf.  
3. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
Performance standards define desired services.  The Government performs surveillance to determine if the contractor exceeds, meets or does not meet these standards.  
The Performance Requirements Summary Matrix includes performance standards.  The Government shall use these standards to determine contractor performance and shall compare contractor performance to the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL). 

TASK	ID	INDICATOR	STANDARD	RATING
	1	Verification use of high quality raw materials	Random audit by Dental Service Chief with monthly results to COTR.

95% Compliance 
	Met/ Partially Met/Fail


	2	Prompt Shipment of dental items	Audit by Dental Service based on order log and shipping with monthly results to COTR

	3	Completed prostheses delivered for Prescription Adherence, Quality of Prostheses 	Every dental provider completes a quality assurance feedback form (see attached). Summary results provided monthly to COTR

95% Compliance
	Met/ Partially Met/Fail


CONTRACT PERFORMANCE MONITORING
A.	Monitoring of contractor's performance shall be done by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).   Incidents of contractor noncompliance as evidenced by the monitoring procedures shall be forwarded immediately to the Contracting Officer.  Upon award, a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan will be signed by the Contractor Program Manager and COTR, outlining the evaluation criteria to ensure the contractor is aware of the management and quality criteria required to meet the terms of the contract.   

B.	Frequency of Measurement:    During contract performance, the COTR will periodically analyze whether the negotiated frequency of surveillance is appropriate for the work being performed. Annual reports are prepared by the COTR and sent to the contractor by the CO 60 days prior to contract option year renewal.

C.	Frequency of Performance Assessment Meetings.   The COTR shall visit/correspond with the contractor either on an as-needed basis or, at a minimum, once during the contract period:   (1) middle of contract period and (2) end of contract period to assess performance and shall provide a written assessment.     This written assessment will be forwarded to the Contracting Officer as documentation of contractor's performance and/or for a request to exercise option period, renewal of a contract or termination of a contract.   

D.	Contractor will review annual performance measure reports and acknowledge receipt of report by returning a signed copy, along with any comments, to the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt of the report.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br />The COAC Services Branch, Office of Acquisitions, DERA, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), NIH, for the Framingham Heart Study under the NHLBI, Division of Intramural Research (DIR) Center for Population Studies, intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis for the purchase of Genomics DNA Services from Beckman Coulter Genomics.
<p>The reference number: NHLBI-CSB-(HL)-2011-193-DDC.</p>
<p>Background:<br />Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and serious illness in the United States. In 1948, the Framingham Heart Study -- under the direction of the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; NHLBI) -- embarked on an ambitious project in health research. At the time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rates for CVD had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and had become an American epidemic.</p>
<p>The objective of the Framingham Heart Study was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke. The Framingham Heart Study continues to make important scientific contributions by enhancing its research capabilities and capitalizing on its inherent resources.</p>
<p>Purpose:<br />The Government has recently completed urinary biomarker profiles in 2900 participants from the Framingham Heart Study. The Framingham facility has used the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and identified a strong association between a SNP in the LRP2 gene and trefoil-3, a urinary biomarker that is associated with GFR and CKD. In subsequent work, the lab showed that this SNP is also associated with variation in eGFR in the CKDGen consortium. The Framingham Heart Study, now wish to sequence the LRP2 gene among individuals with extreme high and low levels of trefoil-3 in order to uncover rare genetic variants that might be associated with CKD. The Government hypothesize that these rare variants will also be associated with CKD.</p>
<p>This project involves the sequencing of the LRP2 gene in 200 samples from the Framingham Heart Study, and promptly returning the data within 8 weeks to The Framingham Heart Study.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: June 15, 2011 through December 14, 2011.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>A. Contractor will provide sequencing services to sequence 200 individuals at the LRP2 gene. The contractor will process NHLBI samples at contractor location using Sanger sequencing methods. <br />B. The Contractor will provide high quality assay results<br />C. Quality control measures will be applied by the Contractor and assay results will be accompanied by quality control information reflecting SNP QC.<br />D. Contractor will specify any special packaging, marking, or shipping instructions for sample shipment.<br />E. Each sample received will be identified by the Contractor using the identifiers provided by NHLBI.</p>
<p>Government Responsibilities: <br />A. NHLBI will provide to the Contractor 4 ug of DNA per SNP per person. In addition, NHLBI will provide a list of identifiers for the sequencing samples.</p>
<p>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables: <br />A. Sequencing results will be returned by Contractor to NHLBI in a standard format in a nonproprietary database in which the sequence data is identified by a standard name. <br />B. Return of the sequence data by the Contractor will be accompanied by summary quality control measures.<br />C. Sequence data will be returned to NHLBI within 8 weeks of receipt of the DNA samples.</p>
<p>Program Management and Control Requirements: <br />No special management or control systems are required under this contract.</p>
<p>Type of service to be purchased:</p>
<p>1. Assay Design and Validation, quantity 72 each<br />2. PCR Setup and Sequencing, quantity 72 each<br />3. SNP and Indel Verification (Manual Review), quantity 72 each</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact the National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The Framingham SABRe CVD Initiative Study under the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of NIH is conducting a study to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) by following the development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who have not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p>Chronic kidney disease is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and many risk factors for chronic kidney disease are also risk factors for cardiovascular disease. As such, a major goal of the lab is to understand predictors of chronic kidney disease, with a particular focus on the genetic determinants of kidney disease. Genome-wide association has been performed to great success, and has identified common genetic variants in association with chronic kidney disease. The next step is to identify rare variants in these genes that might explain larger degrees of trait variation. The method to discover rare variants involve sequencing; Sequencing of a region or gene, such as the LRP2 gene. In addition it is important to use standard techniques across projects. The Government previously used Beckman Coulter Genomics for a prior sequencing project of the UMOD gene; harmonization of methods is critically important in order to minimize technical differences in the approach. Therefore, it is in the Government's best interest to continue the service with Beckman Coulter Genomics for the purpose to fulfill this project as it relates to goal of the Government.</p>
<p>The delivery point is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Framingham Heart Study, 73 Mt. Watye Avenue Perini Building, Framingham MA 01702.</p>
<p><br />The notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology with size standard of 500 employees; the small business set-aside does not apply for this requirement.</p>
<p>The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition <br />procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-50 (May 16, 2011).</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by June 13, 2011, 7:30 am Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><em><strong>POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT AND AMENDMENTS THAT MAYBE ISSUED. </strong></em>
<p><strong>THIS ACQUISITION IS BEING ADVERTISED UNDER FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases has a requirement to establish multi-disciplinary centers that conduct state-of-the-art, high-throughput functional genomics research to increase the infectious disease research community's understanding of the biochemical and physiological role(s) of uncharacterized genomic regions in NIAID Category A-C and other high priority infectious disease pathogens. <br /><br /><strong>Description </strong></p>
<p>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking qualified contractors under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to provide the following:</p>
<p>The primary goals of the activities to be carried out under contract(s) awarded under this BAA will be to conduct large scale, state-of-the-art, high-throughput functional genomics research to increase the infectious disease research community's understanding of the biochemical and physiological role(s) of uncharacterized genomic regions, including promoters, microRNA and other small RNA regions, and conserved hypothetical and unknown open reading frames, in NIAID Category A-C and other high priority infectious disease pathogens. Comparative genomics analyses have repeatedly demonstrated there are many regions of genomic sequence with limited or no known function(s) that are evolutionarily conserved in microbial pathogens, implying these sequences may encode important and/or novel functions. Critical high throughput state-of-the-art research is required to achieve breakthroughs in characterizing the whole sequenced genome and understanding the relationship between a pathogen's genes and gene products and their disease-causing effects in humans. Increased understanding of this relationship will improve the annotation of pathogen genomes and provide the foundation for the development of medical diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.</p>
<p>For this BAA, Functional Genomics is defined as the study of dynamic cellular processes that identify a gene product's biochemical function(s) that contributes to the phenotype of an organism. High-throughput approaches are to be used to determine an uncharacterized gene or gene product's function(s). These technologies will generate data to increase the scientific community's understanding of the relationship between a pathogen's genotype and its phenotypes.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE 1:</strong> This BAA will NOT support studies on HIV/AIDS<br /><strong>NOTE 2:</strong> This BAA will NOT support project that focus exclusively on descriptive characterization studies.</p>
<p>Examples of descriptive research areas that are not appropriate for this BAA include any one or combination of the following but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; Projects that analyze host response in the absence of microbial pathogenesis studies;<br />&bull; Projects that will only utilize gene expression (DNA microarrays, qRT-PCR, RNA sequencing, etc.) and protein expression methodologies (2-D gels, LC-MS, etc.) to analyze the biochemical and physiological role of uncharacterized genomic regions and/or gene(s);<br />&bull; Projects that will only utilize high-throughput protein-protein interaction approaches to characterize potential protein-protein interactions;<br />&bull; Projects that will only analyze the subcellular location of proteins in the absence of studies to analyze the specific biochemical and physiological role of the uncharacterized genomic region and/or gene(s);<br />&bull; Projects that will assess DNA binding properties in the absence of identification and the physiological target genomic regions and/or gene(s) within the pathogen genome;<br />&bull; Projects that will utilize approaches to understand impacts on global biochemical pathways and effects at the systems biology level in the absence of studies to analyze the specific biochemical and physiological role of the uncharacterized genomic region and/or gene(s).<br /><br />This BAA is anticipated to result in multiple awards to offeror(s) capable of performing all aspects the proposed projects.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal.  A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions-Neuroscience, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source, noncompetitive basis to Avaant Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 35 Corporate Drive, Burlington, MA  01803-4223 for the purchase of the drug, tariquidar, which will be administered to human subjects.

NIMHs Molecular Imaging Branch Laboratory has studied tariquidar in human subjects for about four years. The Laboratory initially used an intravenous formulation of the drug, however it was difficult to dilute and required relatively large volumes of fluid for injection. To avoid the large volumes of intravenous fluid, the Laboratory changed about 1.5 years ago to an oral formulation.   The drug is now administered by mouth as a capsule.

Avaant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is the sole manufacturer of the drug, tariquidar, for use in human subjects. They hold the world-wide license for this drug, as well as the Drug Master File for its manufacture.

The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 12-Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and FAR 13.501(a)(1) to use Simplified Acquisition Procedures for Commercial Items.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis by submitting a statement of capabilities on or before 10:00 AM E.T., June 14, 2011 to Korriise LaRoche, larochek@mail.nih.gov.  All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NIDA/NIMH to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award from the NIDA, the vendor must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, the vendor must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at ww.ccr.gov.  Please reference announcement number NOI-2124915 on all correspondence.

Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

                              REPLACE 480 GENERATOR 
                                            575-11-107
                                               
                                                          


This is a design-build construction project.  This project will replace, relocate and upgrade the Building 1 north generator plant at Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Grand Junction, Colorado.

DESCRIPTION
This design/build construction project will provide for the replacement and upgrade of a Cummins 460 KW, 575 KVA diesel powered generator.  A remote concrete foundation will support the new generator plant.  The new generator shall be supported by a monitored underground diesel fuel storage tank. The existing space will be refurbished to become a centralized area for transfer switches and distribution components.


HISTORY

The existing generator plant and day tank are located in a room adjacent to the main switch gear room of the Out Patient Addition (OPA) of Building 1.  The fuel storage tank is located within fifteen (15) feet of the generator.  Replacement of these items is due to age and increased load demand of the OPA.  All equipment is in operation and is providing functional service as originally designed.  The existing diesel fuel storage tank is a double lined fiberglass tank with a volume and leakage monitoring system.  


INTENT

As this project is a Design/Build, the contractor is expected to survey the existing system, conduct investigations on the electrical load connected to the subject generator plant and transfer switches, calculate existing/future loads and design a backup electrical power system which would include but not be limited to generator, environmentally protective fuel tanks, transfer switches, cabling, distribution panels and monitoring systems.  The contract would expect the design to include a new concrete based structure, constructed at an area that is separated from the OPA.  The design would consider electrical components that provide voltage and phase matching technology.  Efficient fuel consumption would also be considered in the design.  Design considerations may include utilizing existing fuel storage tanks for the fuel supply in lieu of a new underground storage tank.  The generator plant shall be fitted with all systems required to maintain a fully charged battery grid and appropriate engine temperature.  The status of the backup power system shall be electronically monitored from within the utility plant, Building 9.

The design and construction of the new generator will be coordinated such that at no time will the Medical Center be without a backup electrical power supply.  All design will comply with VA security standards.

Upon placement and connection of the new generator equipment, demolition of the existing generator unit would provide for the area being utilized as a space completely designated for new and relocated transfer switches.  Removal of the existing fuel tank would require testing for soil contamination.  Remedial abatement would be addressed by this contract.    

Trades involving carpentry, ironworking, masonry, stucco, painting, plumbing/pipefitting, mechanical and electrical shall be utilized for the installation of material and systems.
All work will be coordinated through Engineering Service.  Davis-Bacon wage rates are to apply.


GENERAL 

Completion period:  270 days from NTP

All design and work will conform to the current edition of the VA Master Specifications and VA Design Standards as published at the following site: www.cfm.va.gov, ASHRAE, IBC 2003, NFPA AND NEC building codes and standards.


The C&A requirements do not apply.  A security Accreditation package is not required.

This is a design-build construction project.  This project will replace, relocate and upgrade the Building 1 north generator plant at Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 2121 North Avenue, Grand Junction, Colorado.
DESCRIPTION
This design/build construction project will provide for the replacement/upgrade of a Cummins 460 KW, 575 KVA diesel powered generator, removal of a 2000 gallon underground storage tank and connected underground piping.   The replacement emergency engine generator shall be sized for the load as referenced in the Ross & Baruzinni 3 Sept 2010 letter of information and as determined by field survey/verification by the design/build contractor. A remote concrete foundation and sound/security barrier will support the new generator plant.  The new generator shall be supported by a monitored integral above ground diesel fuel storage tank. The space where the existing generator resides will be refurbished to become a centralized area for future electrical distribution components
HISTORY
The existing generator plant and day tank are located in a room adjacent to the main switch gear room of the Out Patient Addition (OPA) of Building 1.  The existing underground fuel storage tank is located within fifty (50) feet of the generator.  Replacement of these items is due to age and increased load demand of the OPA.  All equipment is in operation and is providing functional service as originally designed.  The existing diesel fuel storage tank is a double lined fiberglass tank with a volume and leakage monitoring system. The monitoring system (Veeder Root-VR) has been providing continuous monitoring data since 1992.  With scheduled UST inspections, a continuum of VR data and soil/water analysis by an independent laboratory, the Government does not anticipate surrounding soil contamination by organic compounds including but not limited to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene or xylene.  

Underground Storage Tank:
Removal of the existing tank shall comply with all intent notices, permits and laboratory procedures as required by the State of Colorado, Department of Labor, Division of Oil and Public Safety regulations and standards.  Contaminated soil and water at the underground storage tank is NOT expected to be an issue as sampling has been completed. (MCG Geotechnical Engineering, Inc.-May 2, 2011).
Concrete Foundation and Sound/Security Barrier:
A mat or raft foundation design is anticipated to be constructed in a remote location adjacent to the west side of Building 1, Out Patient Addition.  A concrete wall with service openings (2) with metal gates shall surround the generator.  Foundation design shall include provisions for spillage retention and removal.  Borings providing soil sampling and analysis has been completed. (Huddleston-Berry Engineering and Testing, LLC-March 29, 2011). 
Diesel Powered Generator Set:
This project anticipates the placement of a single assembly unit with the capacity output of no less than 1000 KVA.  The unit shall be designed and manufactured for exterior environments. The diesel engine shall comply with EPA Tier 2 New Source Performance Standards.   Status monitoring of engine, generator and fuel storage is to be both local at the set and remote at the Boiler plant (B9).  Sound attenuation of the engine and exhaust is to be addressed as a design parameter.
Conduit, Cabling and Distribution:
Conduit and cabling from the new remote generator set location shall be underground with the conduit encased in concrete.  A new distribution panel shall be placed in room 1635-1, existing generator room.  The new distribution panel shall contain new breakers for each existing transfer switch plus spare for future expansion.
Monitoring:
The integral engine and diesel fuel storage tank shall be continually monitored, both locally and remotely (Building 9, Utility Plant).  Signals from the new engine generator, which shall include but not be limited to engine run, engine fail, over crank, block temperature, fuel level and fuel spillage shall be compatible with the existing Veeder-Root TLS-350.

Miscellaneous Construction:
The design for the engine generator facility shall provide elevated metal platforms adjacent to equipment areas requiring preventive maintenance procedures or repair.
Scheduling:
Construction of the new generator plant facility shall be scheduled so that connection and switchover to new equipment/systems imparts minimum impact on the mission for direct patient care by the Medical Center.  This Scope anticipates the new equipment and associated components to be in place and tested prior to connection to the Medical Center's electrical distribution grid.  No existing equipment or their connections will be disconnected prior to final connection of new generator.
Demolition:
The existing generator set and distribution shall be removed from 1635-1 and placed at a location on the Medical Center for retention by the VA.  All facility structure and grounds affected by demolition of construction shall be repaired to prior construction condition.
INTENT
As this project is a Design/Build, the contractor is expected to survey the existing system, conduct investigations on the electrical load connected to the subject generator plant and transfer switches, calculate existing/future loads and design a backup electrical power system which would include but not be limited to generator, environmentally protective fuel tanks, transfer switches, cabling, distribution panels and monitoring systems.  The contract would expect the design to include a new concrete based structure, constructed at an area that is separated from the OPA.  The design would consider electrical components that provide voltage and phase matching technology.  Efficient fuel consumption would also be considered in the design.  The generator plant shall be fitted with all systems required to maintain a fully charged battery grid with appropriate engine temperature.  The status of the backup power system shall be electronically monitored locally and from within the boiler plant, Building 9.
The design and construction of the new generator will be coordinated such that at no time will the Medical Center be without a backup electrical power supply.  All design will comply with VA security standards.
Upon placement and connection of the new generator equipment, demolition of the existing generator unit would provide for the area being utilized as a space completely designated for future installation/relocation of electrical components. The existing fiberglass underground storage tank is to be removed following VA Specification 01 65 00 and State of Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, Division of Oil and Public Safety.  All procedures for the removal of the existing tank shall comply with Code of Colorado Regulation 7 1101-14, Article 2, Sections 2-4-4 and 2-5.
Trades involving carpentry, ironworking, masonry, stucco, painting, plumbing/pipefitting, mechanical and electrical shall be utilized for the installation of material and systems.
All work will be coordinated through Engineering Service.  Davis-Bacon wage rates are to apply.
GENERAL 
Completion period:  180 days from NTP

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY DESCRIPTION<br>M295 IEDK ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONING STUDY<br><br>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:<br><br>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL STUDY.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.  <br><br>TOPIC:<br><br>Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) is conducting a market survey to identify potential facilities with the expertise necessary to develop and execute an accelerated comparative environmental study.  This study will simulate and analyze the effects of several distinct storage environments on the degradation of the M295 Individual Equipment Decontamination Kit (IEDK) (see Attachment A for a brief description of the item) over a 10-year shelf life period.  The actual duration of the study will be much shorter, preferably 12 months or less.  The findings of this study will be used to assist with evaluation of the M295 shelf life extension strategy.<br><br>ECBC has selected the following four climate types for consideration: Desert (Hot Dry- A1), Tropic (Variable High Humidity- B2), 4-Seasons (ranging from Basic Cold- C1 to Basic Hot- A2), and Cold (Cold- C2).  Details for each of these climate types may be found in AR 70-38, dated 15 Sep 1979.  <br><br>GOALS:<br><br>The goals of this study are as follows:<br><br> To thoroughly understand the degradation mechanisms of the M295 under each of the aforementioned storage environments.  This will require that the degradation mechanisms be identified and that all stresses contributing to these mechanisms be adequately replicated.  These mechanisms shall be tracked over time and linked to existing performance criteria to determine if and when failures have occurred, and to characterize the contributing factors.  <br> To determine the relative impact of these environmental climates, and to identify whether a worst-case storage environment exists.  <br> To establish a degradation timeline for storage under each of these environmental climates, based upon a correlation between conditioned time and real time.<br><br>Details of Environmental Conditioning Study: <br><br>The samples to be used in this study shall be stored in the lowest level of packaging approved for storage of fielded kits, to represent the worst case scenario: 80 M295 packets (composed of a flexible laminate material containing a foil center layer, heat sealed at all four edges) in a cardboard box, contained within a heat-sealed overwrap bag.<br><br>Performance tests related to shelf life extension testing include: visual assessment, vacuum leakage test of the packet in accordance with ASTM D3078, and reactivity of the sorbent in the packet (test procedure available upon request).  A packet leak or an insufficient reactivity score, measured as percentage of agent simulant reacted, constitute a failure.  At a minimum, the study shall utilize these tests for determination of sample failures.<br><br>For each of the four storage environments (Desert, Tropic, 4-Seasons, and Cold), a temperature and humidity profile shall be chosen to replicate the stresses attributed to the primary degradation mechanisms, at an accelerated pace: a 10-year shelf life in approximately 12 or fewer months.  For each of these environments, it is desired that all stresses, including mechanical stresses induced by the full range of temperature and humidity expected to be encountered via day/night and winter/summer transitions, be replicated.  This full range of conditions includes those encountered during the "challenge" season (as defined in AR 70-38) and those encountered during the reverse season.  It is recognized that the stresses induced by these conditions may be difficult to characterize using traditional accelerated aging models, therefore, established variations or alternatives to these models will be considered as well.  <br><br>Sample sizes and test increments shall be selected under the assumption that all samples will be furnished.  Prior to insertion into the conditioning chambers and periodically thereafter, the samples shall be visually assessed and tested for leakage and reactivity, in addition to any additional measurements implemented to identify and track degradation mechanisms.  Scheduling and quantity of test increments will be tailored to the study.<br><br>Responders to this survey should clearly and briefly address any one or all of the points below, as well as addressing the ADDITIONAL INFORMATION requested below.<br><br>QUESTIONS:<br><br>Please describe the strategy you would propose to replicate the stresses encountered by the M295 IEDK in each of the storage environments.  What model(s) would you use, and how would you apply them?  If possible, please provide or reference an example of another study which successfully implemented this strategy.<br><br>Please describe the strategy you would propose to identify and track the primary degradation mechanisms of the M295.  What measurements and analytical procedures would you perform, and how would you correlate this data to the performance criteria?<br><br>Please describe the sampling and test strategy you would propose.  Approximately how many samples would be needed to carry out this study, and how would they be used (per subcategory, per test increment, etc)?<br><br>Where do you perceive difficulties in executing this study?  Please include your assessment of difficulty for the following: characterization of thermally induced mechanical stress; comparison between the four storage environments and identification of a single environment as most detrimental to the M295; development of a timeline for each environment which will correlate between conditioned time and real time; completion of the study within a 12-month period.<br><br>Please estimate the total cost and timeframe required to complete the study.  Please include basic information about the conditioning and testing this estimate would include, if not provided in responses to above questions.  Suggested information includes: approximate total number of samples required, number of test increments, subcategories, any necessary preliminary studies or testing, etc.  Additionally, please provide the anticipated timeframe required to complete the study, in months.<br><br>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  <br>1.  Each response is requested to include:  <br>a)  A brief (no more than one page) company description, history, and industry experience.  <br>b)  An executive summary (no more than one page) of the information submitted in reply to this market survey.  <br>c)  Point(s)-of-Contact (POC) with associated information.  <br>d)  A brief narrative of any internal or external programs that may be leveraged to assist in the R&D of the described technology  <br>2.  Each response is requested to document any prior related government work experience.  <br>3.  Each response should be no more than 15 pages in total.<br><br>RESPONSES DUE:<br><br>Responses to this Market Survey are due by 08 July 2011.  Please submit all responses and any questions prior to full response to nicholas.g.hawes.civ@mail.mil.  Please format the subject line of the response email as follows; "[Organization Name] response to Market Survey - M295 Environmental Conditioning Study."<br> <br>RESPONSE FORMAT(S):<br>  <br>Only electronic responses are requested.  Please provide responses in any of the following formats: Microsoft word, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Power Point.  The maximum size of each e-mail should be not more than three and one-half (3.5) megabytes. You may use multiple e-mail messages.  The subject line must include message 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3 etc., as well as the name of your organization.  All interested entities *e.g. companies, non-profit organizations, and academic institutes, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.<br><br>GENERAL INFORMATION:<br><br>The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute.  *To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information", we will use the term "PROPRIETARY".  Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any PROPRIETARY (e.g., trade secret) restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<br>        <br>1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<br><br>2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<br><br>3.  The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.  Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data.<br><br>4.  Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS".<br><br>5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<br><br>6.  The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses.  Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.  The Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.

<DESC>UNCLAS: Dist A Approved for public release<br>                         Market Survey Questionnaire<br>                                       for<br>                         M48A1 - Gas Particulate Filter<br><br><br>GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as "confidential" under this statute. [To avoid possible confusion with the meaning of the term "confidential" in the context of Classified Information," we will use the term "PROPRIETARY."] Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or PROPRIETARY restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following: <br><br> 1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br><br> 2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected. <br><br> 3.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data. <br><br> 4.  Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends 'PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS." <br><br> 5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the  <br>U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. <br><br> 6.  The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain confidential information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available. <br><br><br><br><br>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: <br><br>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT: No contract will be awarded from this announcement. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation. Also, it is not a request seeking contractors interested in being placed on a solicitation mailing list. Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to the market survey and any follow-on information requests. Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned. No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<br><br>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT: <br><br>The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information on commercial industry capability to satisfy U.S. Army requirements for a Gas Particulate Filter (GPF). The requirement will be achieved in a single step versus an evolutionary series or steps.<br> 1. Description:<br><br>The M48A1 GPF is a two-part filter. One part is a carbon compartment and the other a compartment filled with HEPA media. The two components remove any chemical or biological warfare agents from the air stream passing through the filter before going to users. The versatile M48A1s are part of the collective protection overpressure system and is used in a variety of filter/blower applications' design for in-line airflow patterns, to include M1A1 Series Tanks and other similar vehicles, allowing vehicle occupants to work unencumbered by individual protective equipment. The M48A1 is also a component of the M93 Gas Particulate Filter Unit (GPFU) that provides filtered air and positive pressure to users inside a shelter. <br><br> 2. Mission:<br><br>The M48A1 Gas Particulate Filter provides 100 CFM of clean air to occupants in a large vehicle or fixed shelter while protecting against chemical/biological warfare agents and radiological particles. <br><br> 3. Users:  Department of Defense<br><br> 4. Capabilities:<br><br>  Removes chemical and biological agents from up to 100 CFM of air flowing through the specific system.<br>  Uses ASZM-TEDA carbon that can be disposed of as non-hazardous waste, reduces potential health hazards to the end user if the filter is ruptured and carbon is released. <br>  Filter components and media materials are resistant to fungus and mildew.<br>  Effective filtration at temperatures ranging from -60 F to + 160 F. <br>  Three-year shelf life.<br><br><br>INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE QUESTIONNAIRE: <br><br> 1.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:<br>

The U.S. Army, ACC-Picatinny, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager, Maneuver Ammunition Systems, located at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, is seeking to identify potential  manufacturers of a solution to make 20mm ammunition waterproof. <br><br>
 SPECIFICATIONS/CAPABILITIES: <br>
Interested sources shall address a solution to create a weatherproof seal:<br>
	Between an approximately 0.769 inch cylindrical projectile and the thin-wall brass case surrounding it.<br>
	The area of concern is a groove in the projectile with radius of approximately 0.077 inches.  <br>
	The brass case is crimped to the projectile and held in place with this groove.<br>
	Once crimped, the cartridge will be subjected to substantial external forces during its lifecycle, including those forces associated with cycling the item from sea level to high altitudes. <br>	 The cartridge needs to maintain its waterproof seal after exposure to the conditions above.  <br><br>

<p>PROGRAM TITLE: FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION CONTRACT WEATHER OBSERVATION (CWO) SERVICES PROGRAM</p>
<p><br />This Market Survey/RFI is for information purposes only. This Market Survey/RFI is neither a Screening Information Request (SIR) nor release of a Request for Proposal (RFP) of any kind, and does not guarantee procurement of the underlying services. Further, the Federal Aviation Administration is neither seeking nor accepting unsolicited proposals.</p>
<p>All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not provide reimbursement for any information provided or any other costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry to this market survey announcement. Therefore any costs associated with market survey submissions will be solely at the interested parties expense.</p>
<p><br />POINTS OF CONTACT:</p>
<p>Donald L. Richardson, Sr., Contracting Officer, AJA-464, (202) 385-8415</p>
<p>Address all written correspondence to the following:</p>
<p>Federal Aviation Administration<br />Attn: AJA-464, Donald L. Richardson, Sr.<br />600 Independence Ave., S.W., Room 4W850<br />Washington, D.C. 20591</p>
<p>PURPOSE OF ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
<p>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration's Acquisition Management System (FAAAMS), Section 3.2.1.3.12, industry is hereby informed that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement valued at over $100,000.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The FAA is responsible for aviation weather observation services at designated locations, primarily airports, throughout the United States including remote sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico. Since March 1995, the FAA has satisfied this responsibility through the use of the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), or the Aviation Weather Observing System (AWOS), FAA employees and contract weather observer personnel.</p>
<p>Presently, the Contract Weather Observation (CWO) program utilizes 15 contractors, predominantly small and very small businesses, which provide weather observation services at 148 contract sites in FAA-owned or FAA-leased locations.</p>
<p>The following summary represents the CWO locations aligned within the three (3) Service Areas. They will be further divided into groups.</p>
<p>- Eastern Service Area contains approximately 54 sites within the following states: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.</p>
<p>- Central Service Area contains approximately 48 sites within the following states: Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>- Western Service Area contains approximately 24 sites within the following states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, and Hawaii.</p>
<p>Alaska Service Area contains approximately 22 sites within the state of Alaska.</p>
<p><br />Objective:</p>
<p>The objective of this Market Survey/RFI is to solicit feedback from sources capable of performing aviation weather observation services. It is the FAA's intent to inform industry of a planned competitive contract(s) (estimated at over $100 million dollars) that will provide for aviation weather observer personnel to augment the ASOS and AWOS at selected airports throughout the United States, including remote sites in Alaska and Puerto Rico. The small business community primarily provides the CWO Program its current weather observation services. The FAA is now seeking to identify potential small businesses that have the experience and qualifications necessary to perform the services required. No solicitation package is currently available. However, the applicable North American Industry Classification System Code for this requirement is 541990. This future contracting opportunity will be set-aside for competition among small businesses unless the FAA determines that no adequate competition or capable small business sources exists. The FAA encourages subcontracting and teaming arrangements by all participants.</p>
<p>The FAA seeks to identify small businesses and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals that possess the following knowledge and experience:</p>
<p>1. Knowledge of FAA and National Weather Service (NWS) Orders, directives and policy relating to CWO services.</p>
<p>2. Knowledge, familiarity or experience with ASOS or AWOS.</p>
<p>3. Knowledge and understanding of the National Airspace System (NAS).</p>
<p>4. Previous experience providing or managing aviation weather observation service at multiple locations.</p>
<p>5. Previous experience, knowledge or management capability for a small business to manage other small businesses and/or small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in a contractual arrangement that would include handling payroll and reports for multiple locations or subcontractors.</p>
<p>6. The ability to provide and manage an aviation weather observation-training program.</p>
<p><br />5/06/2011 Schedule:</p>
<p>The FAA encourages the participation of all interested parties, and request that interested firms provide a letter of interest and a detailed statement of their capabilities that addresses all of the above criteria not later than May 26, 2011 at 4:00 p.m. EDT. In addition, it is requested that the letter of interest contain appropriate points of contact, a completed Business Form (see attached), and indicate whether teaming arrangements for this effort will be used. No extensions to this submission will be granted. The FAA request that any proprietary information shall be marked appropriately so that all responses to this Market Survey/RFI can be properly secured and protected.</p>
<p>The FAA will use the submissions solely to identify interested firms and to gain a better insight into the level of expertise that may be required to meet the FAA's needs and to assist in determining whether a competitive small business set-aside is an appropriate procurement method for this effort. In addition, the FAA may use any comments submitted in response to the Market Survey/RFI to develop an acquisition strategy and to establish key milestone dates for the future procurement. The information obtained will not be used to qualify firms for any future opportunities. The FAA does not intend to conduct written or oral discussions regarding the information received as a result of the Market Survey/RFI. The FAA will provide further details regarding this requirement and release a list of interested firms in a future public announcement.</p>

<DESC>This is NOT a solicitation announcement, and no proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis. This is a source sought notice (SSN) for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Since this is a sources sought notice, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.
<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications for providing data on all construction projects in the U.S. that are in the contract award or start stage. The objective of this requirement is to obtain the most comprehensive database of construction project information available.</p>
<p>The required data is used as a source for developing samplings for the Census Bureau surveys for determining the value of construction put in place. The data is prepared for direct entry into the gross domestic product (GDP) and are used extensively by the private sector and other Government agencies. <br />The measurement of the value put in place involves a family of surveys and data sources designed to compile the amount of work put in place for each classification of construction. Classifications of construction are based on ownership and /or primary use of the project or complex of structures on a property.</p>
<p>-Construction is defined as the building or site fabrication of permanent structures and facilities including additions, alterations and major replacements, but excluding maintenance and repairs.</p>
<p>The value of work put in place is the aggregate of materials, labor, overhead and profit charged to a construction operation including the value of architectural and engineering services associated with the construction operation. The statistics on the value of construction put in place result from direct measurement and indirect estimation. A series results from direct measurement when it is based on reports of the actual value of construction progress or construction expenditures obtained from complete records or sample surveys. Indirectly estimated series are developed by using related construction statistics.</p>
<p>The required data for all construction projects in the U.S. at the contract award or start state must include the following:<br />&bull; The file must provide detailed information for each uniquely identified project including, but not limited to:<br />1) Description with detailed type of construction code; <br />2) Location; <br />3) Valuation; <br />4) Ownership designation (private, state, local, or federal); <br />5) Type of project (new, addition, or alteration); <br />6) Square feet of floor space; <br />7) Owner's name, address, and telephone number; <br />8) Name, address, and telephone number of other project officials (architect, contractor, engineer, etc.); and <br />9) Contract number (when applicable - very important for Federal projects and helpful for State and local projects.)<br />&bull; Data shall be submitted in a flat ASCII file.<br />&bull; Data/File shall be updated monthly and is required by the 3rd workday of each month.<br />&bull; Minimum coverage for data is 60 percent of all construction projects in the U.S. and at the contract award or start stage, and 80 percent of all construction projects in the U.S. valued over $10 million.<br />&bull; Data must be auditable to verify coverage and sorted by geographic regions.<br />&bull; Sources must also provide a means for producing customized reports and access by Internet.</p>
<p>Interested firms responding to this market survey must provide capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Governments requirements for the above. All respondents are requested to identify their firm's sizes and type of business. Brochures alone are not sufficient documentation for demonstration of capabilities. The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail, but not exceed 15 pages, so that the Government can determine the experience and capability of your firm to provide the requirement above. Your capability statement should include references. Responses must be received via email no later than July 7, 2011, 4:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Savings Time. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for information solicited.</p>

<DESC>Project Description:  Hospital Nutrition Care Department Addition/Alteration, Phase I, Joint Base San Antonio, Texas. Project Number 51969. Construct an addition and alteration to the San Antonio Military Medical Center-North Campus (SAMMC-N).  The project will expand and reconfigure the existing Nutritional Care Department into the adjacent light well/courtyard and extends the interstitial space over the new kitchen.  Supporting facilities include select utility upgrades and alteration:  phasing costs, temporary facilities, and temporary parking.  The project will be designed in accordance with criteria prescribed in DoD Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-510-01, World Class Evidence Based Design principles, DoD  Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings UFC 4-010-01, barrier-free design in accordance with DoD criteria and the DEPSECDEF Memorandum "Access for People with Disabilities" dated October 31, 2008, and applicable energy conservation legislation.  The project will be designed to LEED 3.0 Silver Certified rating standard.  Operations and Maintenance Manuals, Comprehensive Interior Design and enhanced commissioning will be provided.  Air Conditioning:  estimated 20 tons.   <br>Range of Magnitude:  between $25,000.000 and $100,000,000.  <br>Period of Performance:  2 years after date of award.    <br><br>Some of the factors that maybe considered regarding their use are:<br>a.)	The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.<br>b.)	The complexity of the project.<br>c.)	Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br>d.)	Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.<br>e.)	The use of PLA's on other comparable projects.<br>f.)	The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br>g.)	The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br>h.)	Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.<br>PLA is defined as a Pre-Hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).<br>Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), Policy:<br>a.)	Project Labor Agreement,(PLA), is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal Procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, Agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.<br>b.)	An Agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree for that project to negotiate or become party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the Agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:<br>1.)	Advance the Federal Government's interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, produce-labor management stability and ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health. Equal opportunity, labor and employment standards and other matters and...<br>2.)	Be consistent with law.<br>Reference Provision: 52.222-23 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreements.<br>In consideration of the above factors and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLA's. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:<br>a.)	Should PLA's be executed on selected large dollar contracts at the Joint Base San Antonio, Texas? What other factors should the Corps of Engineers consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Fort Worth District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for the utilization of a PLA?<br>b.)	Is the use of PLA's effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government if using PLA's? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?<br>c.)	Is the use of PLA's effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?<br>d.)	Is the use of PLA's conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLA's used for those specific contracts?<br>e.)	Projects will require multiple construction contractors and/or subcontractors employing working in multiple crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both prime contractor and at least one subcontractor or two or more subcontractors employing the same trade? <br>f.)	Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.<br>g.)	Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance period. Will a PLA impact completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?<br>h.)	Where have PLA's been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, Municipal or private entities in the San Antonio Joint Base area?<br>i.)	Will the use of PLA's impact the ability of potential offerors and/or subcontractors to meet the Small Business utilization goals?<br>Please provide your comments via email ONLY to: james.bales@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on 17 June 2011.<br>Agency/Contracting Office:  <br>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District<br>ATTN: CESWF-CT (Room 2A19)<br>819 Taylor Street<br>Fort Worth, Texas  76102-0300<br><br>Place of Performance:<br> Bexar County<br>San Antonio, Texas 78236  <br>Point of Contact:<br>Mr. James A.

Contracting Office Address: 
Marine Corps Systems Command,

Quantico, VA. 22134-6050
Program Manager, Combat Support Equipment

Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) is conducting market research in support of Marine Corps Arctic Operations to leverage the vast engineering and design expertise of the outdoor recreation, adventure, and survival industry, of shelter manufacturers, and of manufacturers of advanced technology fabric/material.  MCSC intends to engage industry in a discussion about several aspects of a forthcoming procurement for shelters to be used in extreme cold weather environments.  Through interactions with industry, MCSC aims to identify several potential sources capable of addressing the availability, design, and performance capabilities of extreme cold weather shelters..
  MCSC also intends to enlist the support of industry in crafting terms and conditions and solicitation provisions that will provide incentives for competition and foster maximum participation.  Currently, the United States Marine Corps (USMC) employs a 10-Man Arctic Shelter fabricated per MIL-DTL-12354G.  The USMC is looking to replace this shelter with a free standing, four-season, 15-Man Arctic Shelter. 
The following list of salient characteristics for the 15-Man Arctic Shelter were developed in response to information gathered from previous market research efforts.  They were developed in response to anticipated operating conditions, manpower availability, transportability concerns operational security considerations, and equipment compatibility.
 
a)	Fabricated with materials that are mildew resistant in accordance with AATCC 30 and flame resistant in accordance with CPAI-84; 
b)	Usable floor space of 275 sq ft (threshold) to 305 sq ft (objective);
c)	Interior headroom at apex shall be no greater than 78 inches (threshold) and 74.5 inches (objective);
d)	The shelter system is to weigh no more than 76 pounds (threshold) and 51 pounds (objective);
e)	Capable of operating in temperatures ranging from -25F to 125F (threshold), -40F to 125F (objective);
f)	Compatible with the current Space Heater Arctic (SHA) (NSN: 4520-01-444-2375);
g)	Capable of withstanding high winds of 50 mph steady with 55 mph gusts (threshold) and 55 mph steady with 65 mph gusts (objective);
h)	Provide protection from driving rain at 2 inches per hour in a steady wind of 20 mph for a minimum of 15 minutes  (threshold) and 2 inches per hour in a steady wind of 30 mph for a minimum of 15 minutes (objective);
i)	Capable of operating under a snow load of four pounds per square foot;
j)	Provide visual blackout protection to current military detection standards; exterior fabric with a maximum opacity of .030 ft lamberts; FED STD 191a, Test Method 5781.
  No light leakages through opening, (i.e. vents, doors, etc.);
k)	Provide a means to interchange between two exterior camouflage colors (arctic camouflage color Cable No. 37875 per FED-STD-595 and woodland camouflage pattern drawing 2-1-1516B);
l)	Equipped with a removable, water resistant/repellant, full ground floor, with one floor portal/hatch, with closure, to accommodate the SHA;
m)	Provide ventilation at a minimum of four feet above the shelter floor to reduce the interior build-up of condensation;
n)	Equipped with an anchoring system and ground skirts/gutters to secure the shelter in high wind conditions;
o)	Equipped with two doors (opposite sides) to enable complexing (inter-connect) between Arctic Shelters and allow Marines in full cold weather combat gear to enter/exit the shelter unencumbered;
p)	Shall be erected and struck by 6 Marines wearing full, cold weather combat gear within 30 minutes (threshold) and 3 Marines wearing full cold weather combat gear within 15 minutes (objective), requiring no special tools;
q)	Shall remain serviceable for a minimum of 30 continuous erect/strike cycles in any of the operational conditions, noted above;
r)	Supplied with a field expedient repair kit; 
s)	Shall have provisions for suspending and drying wet articles of clothing (i.e.

t)	Shall have a primary transport bag that provides easy access and maintains proper functionality; 

MCSC is inviting industry to provide  information  on the best available design, technology, and materials geared towards operations in extreme cold weather environments.  Interested parties are also encouraged to suggest terms and conditions, reasonable schedules, and other pertinent details from both a technical and business perspective that might make this procurement more attractive to industry.  Industry should understand that the Government has drafted the above noted salient characteristics from a particular perspective.
  If there is other terminology, performance standards, or other technical aspects that if changed would provide wider access to industry partners, respondents to this RFI should provide that information in their response.  MCSC recognizes that fabric/material technologies also play an integral role in enabling operations in extreme cold weather environments.  Therefore fabric/material manufacturers are also encouraged to engage in discussions with MCSC regarding this effort.  Anyone  interested in supporting MCSC in their market research to provide the USMC with the best technologies and products available to support Arctic Operations is request to provide the following information:  
	Technical discussion of the salient characteristics described above, including ability of industry to currently meet them
	Production capability 
	Warranty terms 
	Pricing
	Business size (i.e.
 large business, small business if small business number of employees
	Ability to meet Berry Amendment restrictions (address down to the basic component or fiber level)
	Information regarding new technologies, materials, etc. or changes that could be made to expand the availability of products
	Information that would increase competition among the industry
	Lead time to order material, build, and provide a product for testing.  The Government anticipates purchasing a small quantity of samples as part of the evaluation process once the request for proposals (RFP) is issued.  The amount of time RFP is open for response and for submittal of those samples will in part be dependent on the information received from industry regarding lead times.
    

Respondents may address these items through the use of product literature, brochures, test data (if available) or technical specifications, website information, and the like.  The Government reserves the right to ask follow-up questions and refine this RFI as part of the market research effort.

	Any additional information industry/interested parties would like to provide 

Interested parties are to send information electronically via e-mail to daniel.story@usmc.mil.  Although submission of information via e-mail to daniel.story@usmc.mil is preferred, respondents may send two (2) copies of information to the following address due to constraints on byte size per e-mail (a maximum of 5MB per e-mail):
Marine Corps Systems Command PG-16 CESS
ATTN: Daniel Story
2201A Willis Street
Quantico, VA 22134

Due to the nature of the item being procured, the Berry Amendment (10 U.S.C.
 2533a) will apply to any future procurement actions resulting from this RFI.  Interested parties should ensure that all information submitted in response to this RFI intended to be protected as proprietary is marked as such.  Information submitted will become the property of the Government and will be handled as proprietary if appropriately marked.  Interested parties that elect to send information to the above address, please send an e-mail to daniel.story@usmc.mil with notification of information being mailed, tracking information, and by which carrier shipped.  No telephone calls will be accepted.  Responses are to be received by 3:30 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on Thursday 7 July 2011.
 Submission of this information is for market research purposes only, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any item, or the government to pay for the information provided.  This is not a request for proposal or quotation, nor does MCSC intend to award on the basis of this RFI.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI.  No solicitation document exists at this time.  This RFI is for market research purposes only. 

Interested parties (whether representatives from the outdoor industry, shelter manufacturers, fabric/material suppliers or manufacturers, or a combination of all of the above) are highly encouraged to contact Daniel Story, daniel.story@usmc.mil schedule discussion sessions with the Marine Corps Shelter Team to further evolve the Arctic Shelter effort.
  Discussions can be performed in person at 50 Tech Parkway, Suite 301, Stafford, VA 22556 or via telephone conference and are intended to be informal in nature.  Inability to meet with the team in person in no way hinders an interested party from consideration from this effort.  It is the Governments goal to have frequent discussions with industry throughout the planning phase of this procurement and beyond; therefore, the Government anticipates engaging industry in follow-up discussions at various points in the market research process.  All discussion questions and answers will be posted to NECO/FedBizOps to provide industry equal access to information.  However, the Government will protect non-public information, including confidential and proprietary information from disclosure.
  Travel costs are at the expense of the interested party, and will not be reimbursed by the government.

A market survey of properties offered for lease will be conducted by VA. Properties offered must be accompanied by proof of being located outside of the 100-year-flood-plain zone. Interested offerors (owners, brokers, or their legal representatives) should contact Michael James by e-mail (michael.james6@va.gov no later than 4:30 P.M. (EDST), on 07/07/2011.

The Government is limited by law (40 USC 278a, as Amended 10-1-81) to pay no more than the appraised fair rental value for space. Please note: This advertisement is not a solicitation for offers, nor is it a request for proposals. A solicitation for offers may be issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs at a later date.
     
UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS:

Office space must be contiguous and have potential for efficient layout. The Government requires a fully serviced lease including on-site parking spaces. Handicapped parking must be available on-site. All services, supplies, utilities, partitioning and tenant alterations are desired as part of the rental consideration. The Government shall have access to the space 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year. The offered space must meet Government requirements for Fire and Life Safety and Handicapped Accessibility. Buildings that contain asbestos or PCB materials will not be considered.

The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing space or to relocate to alternative space. The Government will consider alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a superseding lease to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs associated with moving. These costs include, but are not limited to, physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications, security infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime and the impact of a move on the agency's mission. Owners, brokers or agents may offer space for consideration. Any properties submitted by brokers or agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized by the ownership to exclusively represent the building offered.

<DESC><p>The proposed contractor, to our knowledge, is the only organization that has compiled detailed information on how public health preparedness programs are organized.&nbsp; They completed this work under contract with CDC, which built upon work they were already conducting.&nbsp; The project was quite successful, yielding a nuanced taxonomy of public health preapredness programs that shows promise in helping explain differences in spending patterns by how the preparedness unit is organized.&nbsp; The results will be published in a peer-reviewed publication.&nbsp; The proposed contractor has published numerous articles in peer-reviewed journals focusing on the organization of public health and legislation, as well as spent a considerable amount of time in the field observing public health preparedness at the local level.&nbsp; They have also drafted exercise scenarios for local health departments as well as evaluated those exercises, which further puts them in a strong position to understand the structure of public health preparedness at the state and local level.&nbsp; As a result of this experince, the contractor has a unique database of preparedness programs organization, as well as unique insight into how variation in organization may effect the ability to move funds from the state to the local level.&nbsp; They also possess an in-depth knowledge on where relevant, publicly-available information on legislation and regulations exist for each state.&nbsp; This database and knowledge puts the proposed contractor in a unique position to analyze organizational data on PHER expenditures recently reported to CDC as well as refine, as necessary, their existing taxonomy.&nbsp; The will also be able to help CDC select up to 9 health departments for in-depth case studies.&nbsp; It would take another contractor well over a year to collect the information on public&nbsp;health preparedness programs that the proposed contractor already possesses.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to award sole source contract modification.  The National Park Service, North Cascades National Park Service Complex, Sedro-Woolley, Washington, intends to award a sole source modification to Wesslen Construction of Spokane, Washington valued at $48,179 for additional within scope work.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and is announced for the purpose of compliance with Federal Acquisition Regulations, the justification follows:
1.  Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity: Department of Interior, National Park Service, North Cascades National Park, 810 State Route 20, Sedro-Woolley, WA 98284.
2. Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved: Modification of contract C9471101055 for additional within scope work.
3.  A Description of the Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs, Including the Estimated Value: Modification, addresses safety concerns with the engineering and design not initially apparent in the drawings and specifications but apparent now that the structure has been built and is being used by passenger ferry boats. Proposed action to address safety concerns are 1) install one additional pile for ferry boat mooring when lake elevation is at full pool, and 2) install four additional bollards to protect the fixed walkway from potential damage caused by vehicular traffic and separate vehicular and pedestrian traffic flows. Net increase $48,179 (original award $982,703).
4. An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: COTI 1443.06-01, as amended, DIAPR 2008-10 and FAR 6.3
5. A Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited: This was a competitive project that was properly synopsized and awarded. Wesslen Construction was selected as the Best Value in accordance with the solicitation requirements and Federal Acquisition Regulations. The Contractor has performed quality work throughout the duration of the project and has completed construction per the construction documents (drawings and specifications). As the public has started using the new passenger ferry dock facility, certain safety elements that were not apparent in the original design, such as the need for an additional mooring pile and four additional bollards, have become obvious. Stehekin, Washington is one of the most remote locations in the lower 48 states, and Contractor access to Stehekin is via a 55 mile long barge trip or float plane. Before the Contractor demobilizes equipment from the site, the Government has requested and agreed upon a fair and reasonable price to perform the additional safety requirements. It would be significantly more expensive to mobilize and demobilize the equipment needed to install these elements if this were part of a separate contract. 
6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice Was or Will Be Publicized as Required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, If Not, Which Exception Under FAR 5.202 Applies:  The Notice of Intent modification will be properly synopsized.
7. A Determination By the Contracting Officer That the Anticipated Cost to the Government Will Be Fair and Reasonable: Pricing for the additional work has been reviewed by the Program Manager and the Contracting Officer, documentation is on file.
8. A Description of the Market Research Conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market Research was conducted for the original contract. This added work is directly related to the original scope of work, it would not be practical to try and obtain a second contractor to do a small part of the additional work required.
9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (see FAR 6.302-2 (9) (i) - (iii) for some examples): N/A
10.  A Listing of the Sources, If Any, That Expressed in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: N/A

Description of Project

A.	Project Overview: This project will replace the walk-in coolers and freezers in the canteen (Building 500) and warehouse (Building 501).  Both units exhibit the following: condensation, air leaks, high temperatures and structural failure.  The condensation can lead to potential mold and slip hazards.  The new units shall be updated to industry standards and demonstrate energy efficiency.  The existing coolers and freezers are deteriorating.  The corners are leaking creating a loss in cooled air.  In building 500, the coolers are positioned near a loading bay that has large amounts of airflow during business hours.  The doors for the new units shall prevent airflow with automatic door systems and slip doors.  The cooler in Building 501 is not cooling at proper temperatures and needs to be replaced.  In addition, the ceiling is caving in and is currently temporarily patched.  The new systems shall be up-to-date with industry standards.  The contractor shall provide energy efficient systems and controls for maintaining appropriate temperatures.  The new coolers shall be fully insulated to prevent thermal flow and condensation.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC (Randolph AFB TX Fair Oaks Rec) diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review recent (within the last three years) and relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>
<p>52.212-4 Addendum 1-Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

<p>The following clauses are incorporated in full text: <br /><br />FAR 52.211-6 -Brand Name or Equal As prescribed in 11.107(a), insert the following provision: Brand Name or Equal (Aug 1999) <br />(a) If an item in this solicitation is identified as "brand name or equal," the purchase description reflects the characteristics and level of quality that will satisfy the Government's needs. The salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics that "equal" products must meet are specified in the solicitation. <br />(b) To be considered for award, offers of "equal" products, including "equal" products of the brand name manufacturer, must<br />(1) Meet the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristic specified in this solicitation; <br />(2) Clearly identify the item by<br />(i) Brand name, if any; and <br />(ii) Make or model number; <br />(3) Include descriptive literature such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer; and</p>
<p>(4) Clearly describe any modification the offeror plans to make in a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements. Mark any descriptive material to clearly show the modification. <br />(c) The Contracting Officer will evaluate "equal" products on the basis of information furnished by the offeror or identified in the offer and reasonably available to the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the offer. <br />(d) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that the product being offered is an "equal" product, the offeror shall provide the brand name product referenced in the solicitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (End of Provision)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9000 AGENCY PROTESTS (SEP 1999)</p>
<p>Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the Contracting Officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (End of Provision)</p>

<p>(a) The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the Contracting Officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.</p>
<p>(c) If you wish to opt out of this clause, check here ( ). Alternate wording may be negotiated with the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (End of Provision)</p>

<p>For all shipments of packaged materiel to the government,<br />which includes either Depot (DLA-Direct) or DVD (Customer-<br />Direct) shipments, both DoD linear and two-dimensional (2D)<br />bar code markings are required on Military Shipping Labels<br />in accordance with MIL-STD-129, Revision P, dated December<br />15, 2002 (but see DLAD 52.211-9010(D) for exceptions to the<br />requirement for MSL and 2D symbols). See the DLA packaging<br />web site identified in DLAD 52.211-9010(E) for change<br />notices to MIL-STD-129P that apply. 2D bar coding shall be<br />in accordance with ISO/IEC 15438, ISO/IEC 15434 (ANSI MH10.8.3)<br />and DoD 4500.9-R. MSL linear (code 3 of 9 or code 39) bar<br />coding shall be in accordance with ISO/IEC 16388. Shipping<br />label stock quality shall meet MIL-PRF-61002. Bar code print<br />quality shall meet ANSI MH10.8-2000 or ANSI X3.182-1990 (R2000)<br />for applicable 2D and/or linear bar codes. All DVD shipments<br />shall meet additional linear bar coding requirements in DLAD<br />52.211-9010(C). Except for the Transportation Control Number<br />(TCN), which must always be present on the Military Shipping<br />Label, when the contract/order omits any other data elements as<br />defined in MIL-STD-129P and if the information is not available<br />from the Administrative Contracting Office, then the field is<br />not required as part of the Military Shipping Label and may be<br />left blank. If there are inconsistencies between the schedule<br />and MIL-STD-129P, the schedule takes precedence.</p>

<p>The contract awarded as a result of this Request for Proposal (RFP) will be an integrated assessment of the results of the evaluation based on the evaluation factors and their relative order of importance, as indicated below. Award shall be made to the Offeror whose RFP is determined to best meet the needs of the Government after consideration of all factors.<strong> The two (2) technical factors - Technical Acceptability and Past Performance</strong> when combined are more important than Cost (non-technical factor). "Best value," for the purpose of this RFP, is defined as the procurement process that results in the most advantageous acquisition decision for the Government and is performed through an integrated assessment and trade-off analysis between the non-cost/price factors and cost/price factors.

<p><strong>FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY</strong></p>

<p>2. Quotes will be evaluated based on best value with the evaluation criteria listed below.</p>
<p><br />3. All quotes shall include not only the total cost, but all costs associated with the requirement.</p>
<p><br /><strong>EVALUATION 52.212-2 EVALUATION -COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</strong></p>
<p>The contract awarded as a result of this Request for Proposal (RFP) will be an integrated assessment of the results of the evaluation based on the evaluation factors and their relative order of importance, as indicated below. Award shall be made to the Offeror whose RFP is determined to best meet the needs of the Government after consideration of all factors. <strong>The two (2) technical factors - Technical Acceptability and Past Performance</strong> when combined are more important than Cost (non-technical factor). "Best value," for the purpose of this RFP, is defined as the procurement process that results in the most advantageous acquisition decision for the Government and is performed through an integrated assessment and trade-off analysis between the non-cost/price factors and cost/price factors. Ultimately, the source selection decision will take into account the contractor's capability to meet the requirements of this solicitation on a timely and cost-effective basis. Accordingly, the Government may award any resulting contract to other than the lowest priced Offeror, or other than the Offeror with the highest technical rating.</p>
<p><strong>FACTOR 1: TECHNICAL ACCEPTABILITY</strong></p>
<p>Technical acceptability is the most important factor for the acquisition and will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of the extent to which the contractor's solution will achieve the stated objectives as outlined in the SOW. The evaluation will include an assessment of whether the contractor's solution:</p>
<p>Demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive understanding of the development and delivery of a customized training course outlined in the SOW.</p>
<p><strong>FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCE </strong></p>
<p>The Offeror will be evaluated on the Offeror's proven ability to meet technical acceptability for similar efforts in the recent past. The Offeror should provide a narrative of experience for similar courses or workshops. The narrative should address when the workshops or courses were taught and the approximate number of students.</p>
<p><strong>NON-TECHNICAL FACTOR</strong></p>
<p>Cost (Non-technical Factor): The Offeror is to demonstrate the ability to provide a sound competitive offer associated with the services identified within the solicitation. The government will evaluate the Offeror's cost for fairness and reasonableness.</p>
<p>Cost, while being an important factor, it is not in and of itself the determining factor in the selection of the successful Offeror for award of the contract by this solicitation. Cost is not scored or weighted; rather, each Offeror's cost will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness.</p>

<p>FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders -Commercial Items, apples to this acquisition.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation No. 7FCM-C4-03-0073-B
Schedule 73  Food Service, Hospitality, Cleaning Equipment and Supplies, Chemicals, and Services

Synopsis:

Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, TX, is issuing a refreshed solicitation for the Core Business Line (CBL) for Schedule 073, Food Service, Hospitality, Cleaning Equipment and Supplies, Chemicals, and Services.

<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-52.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541330 with a small business size standard of $4.5 million. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>As concerns about potential releases of airborne CBR (chemical, biological, and radiological) agents have increased, a number of strategies have been pursued to decrease the likelihood and the impact of such events. These strategies include physical security, deployment of sensing systems, and the implementation of specific building and system design features. Among the building system approaches are strategies in which the operation of the HVAC system is modified in response to a suspected or known release to reduce the impact of the agent on the building occupants as well as to make any subsequent building decontamination efforts more manageable. HVAC responses include turning off systems, reducing or increasing the outdoor air intake fraction, redirecting system airflow through dedicated filter or air cleaning systems, or using dampers and airflows to isolate certain portions of the building from others. The effectiveness of these responses will depend on the layout of the building, the type and design of the HVAC system, the timing of the response, and the details of the agent release; making it very difficult to provide general guidance on how best to use HVAC systems in response to CBR releases. However, airflow and contaminant transport simulation tools are available to better understand the effectiveness of HVAC responses under different circumstances and to support guidance on their implementation. As part of its research program to develop such guidance, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are using multi-zone airflow and contaminant transport modeling analysis. In order to support these analyses, NIST requires building models that reflect current design practice to enable the investigation of different design and operational approaches to building protection.</p>
<p>All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:</p>

<p>Proposal Instructions:</p>
<p>The Offeror shall submit the following:</p>
<p>A. Technical Approach (No page limit):</p>
<p>The Offeror shall provide a written, detailed technical approach for how it proposes to satisfy the requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Offeror's technical approach shall demonstrate a thorough understanding of the work requirements and a detailed plan for achieving the objectives of the scope of the PWS. The technical approach shall include information on the techniques and procedures to be employed in achieving the proposed end results in compliance with the requirements of the PWS.</p>
<p>B. Personnel Qualifications (No page limit):</p>
<p>The Offeror shall provide a detailed resume for only the Key Personnel identified by this solicitation. The Contractor shall have at least 10 years of experience in building airflow and indoor air quality simulation.</p>
<p>C. Past Performance (No page limit):</p>
<p>The Offeror shall provide at least two (2) past performance references for similar contracts/orders for which the Offeror has performed as a prime Contractor or as a first-tier subcontractor on similarly scoped contracts/orders awarded to them in the past three years by governmental entities (federal, state, or local) or by non-governmental entities.</p>
<p>D. Price Proposal:</p>
<p>The Offeror shall submit a separate firm-fixed price proposal.</p>
<p>Basis for Award Determination/Evaluation Criteria:</p>
<p>A contract will be issued to the contractor whose proposal is determined to offer the best value to the Government after consideration of all evaluation factors.</p>
<p>Best value is defined as the procurement process that results in the most advantageous acquisition decision for the Government and is performed through an integrated assessment and trade-off analysis among price and non-price factors.</p>
<p>The basis for the award will be a detailed, integrated evaluation by the Government on the basis of how well the proposals satisfy the evaluation criteria specified herein. Accordingly, the Government may award any resulting contract to other than the lowest priced Offeror or other than the Offeror with the highest technical merit rating.</p>
<p>The Government has the right to determine whether two or more technical proposals are &lsquo;substantially equal' or whether any differences in technical weighting are "significant" for the purposes of evaluating the overall merit of proposals. Between proposals of substantially equal technical merit, price will become a more significant factor. Between competing proposals, the Government is not willing to pay significantly more for a minor technical difference, nor is the Government willing to forego a significant technical difference in exchange for a small price differential.</p>
<p>Each quotation will be evaluated against the factors described below. An Offeror's failure to address any factor may be considered indicative of the offeror's lack of understanding of the Government's requirements and may result in the quotation being determined unacceptable.<br /><br />Non-cost/Price factors A through C are listed in descending order of importance. Non-cost factors A through C, when combined, are considered more important than Factor D (Price).</p>
<p>A. Technical Approach:</p>
<p>The technical approach shall be the most important item in the evaluation of the Offeror's capability to perform the desired services. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's proposed technical approach to determine if it presents sufficient information to reflect a thorough understanding of the work requirements and a detailed plan for achieving the objectives of the scope of the contract. The Government will evaluate the techniques and procedures to be employed in achieving the proposed end results in compliance with the requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Offeror must demonstrate complete understanding of the PWS by providing an original and clear statement of the purpose, intent, and requirements of the project.</p>
<p><br />B. Personnel Qualifications:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's proposed key personnel on whether or not their qualifications/experience will provide the necessary skills to complete the tasks as detailed in the PWS. As detailed in the instructions to Offerors, the Contractor shall have at least 10 years of experience in building airflow and indoor air quality simulation.</p>
<p>C. Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past three years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical approach portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.<br /><br />D. Price:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate whether the quoted price is fair and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements, and consistent with the offeror's proposed Technical Approach. Prices that are determined to be either unreasonably high or unrealistically low in relation to the proposed work may indicate the Offeror's lack of understanding of the requirement and may result in the overall proposal being considered unacceptable.</p>
<p>Offerors must provide sufficient details to support proposed prices.</p>

The target of the lead human monoclonal antibody is the CD4 binding site on the gp120 envelope protein of HIV. The materials to be tested for this requirement are investigational anti-viral human monoclonal antibodies.
<p>The Contractor shall perform Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated safety testing and characterization of clinical grade investigational anti-viral human monoclonal antibodies. The safety tests in animals must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) standards (21CFR, Part 58). The studies should be performed consistent with guidance in International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) M3(R2), S6, S6(R1), and S7A documents and other relevant guidance from FDA and ICH.</p>

<DESC>HOTEL, DINING, AND AUDIO/VISUAL EVENT PRODUCTION<br />SBA 2011 Field Management Conference<br />PROPOSED DATES ARE FIRM FOR THE PERIOD SUNDAY, JULY 17, 2011 THROUGH FRIDAY, JULY 22, 2011
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued. The NAICS is 721110 and the Small Business Size Standard is $30.0 million.</p>
<p>A. IDENTIFICATION<br />The Small Business Administration, Field Operations Headquarters intends to block single occupancy sleeping rooms, meeting space, meals, and audio/visual (A/V) event production services for general session presentations for SBA's District Directors, Regional Administrators and supervisors and senior leaders from headquarters.</p>
<p>B. OBJECTIVES<br />The long-term strength of our agency is critically linked to our ability to align our program or individual office goals with the strategic goals of the SBA. For an organization of our size, our managers and frontline leaders must work in concert and not cross-purposes. We've already begun this process by having our frontline leaders work collaboratively with their program department counterparts to identify critical skills and develop training materials that are relevant for both sides. We'd like to build on that momentum by utilizing our time in Denver to gain a shared understanding of SBA's strategic plan and how our 2012 district office and program department goals will be informed by the plan.</p>
<p>The goals of the conference are:</p>
<p>1. To identify, share and begin to implement customer service best practices across the agency.<br />2. To examine and identify the customer and partner experience with the agency's programs and services.<br />3. Identify ways to strengthen our customer service while managing performance across all of our field management units.</p>
<p>C. BACKGROUND<br />The SBA Field Management Conference is aimed at SBA's District Directors, Regional Administrators and supervisors and senior leaders from headquarters. The conference will consist of a series of lectures, presentations, training sessions, interactive breakout sessions, and sharing of ideas, best practices and lessons learned.</p>
<p>A small preparatory group will arrive on Sunday, July 17th. They will need to have a pre-conference meeting with the facility staff and a tour of the facility on the morning of Monday, July 18th. The remaining large contingent of the conference attendees will arrive throughout the day of Monday, July 18th. Attendees will be arriving from the entire United States.</p>
<p>Hotel staff will have conference rooms and all hotel provided equipment setup no later than 7:00 am each morning of the training event as agreed upon by the hotel and SBA's on-site representative. This includes any hotel provided audio-visual equipment.</p>
<p>On the first day of the training event, the hotel's audio-visual technician will be available from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm to assist SBA's presenters with their personal audio-visual equipment setup. Actual start time may change based on final training schedule. SBA's on-site representative will confirm actual day and time audio-visual technician is needed. On-site technical support expertise in audio-visual equipment setup and trouble-shooting necessary to resolve routine audio-visual malfunctions is required. Daily, during the hours of 8:00 am and 5:00 pm, hotel's audio-visual staff must be available to provide technical support within 30 minutes of the hotel being notified by SBA's presenters or on-site representative.</p>
<p>SBA's lead contact and on-site representative for all training events is Ms. Susan Nassaux, Field Operations Specialist. Ms. Nassaux may provide additional SBA on-site representatives who may be serving as alternate Agency on-site representatives for specific training events during the performance period.</p>
<p>D. HOTEL LOCATION, QUALITY AND ACCOMMODATIONS<br />The conference space will be used as a training classroom. This will require one large banquet room with unobstructed interior views large enough for various training room configurations/setups (classroom, U-shape, circles, etc) to comfortably accommodate approximately 150 participants. Likewise, SBA may need four smaller work rooms to comfortably accommodate approximately 15-20 participants. At a minimum, all rooms must be Internet accessible and may require standard audio-visual presentation equipment (LCD projectors, microphones/lavalieres, projector screen (or 60" or larger LED/LCD/HD TV screen), connection cables, power cords) technical support and setup available for training presenters. Conference rooms and audio-visual equipment must be reserved solely for SBA for the duration of the event.</p>
<p>In order to meet SBA requirements, all conference and meeting spaces must be contiguous or in very close proximity (line of sight preferred) to each other. The banquet room space, where the General Sessions will be held will be the main focus of the conference, therefore, the space shall be visually appealing. The banquet rooms space shall comfortably accommodate up to 150 adults. The four meeting rooms shall be required to comfortably accommodate 20 adults for smaller work-related meetings. All program space must be blocked for the sole use of SBA for the duration of the conference. Spaces shall be clean, well ventilated, well lit, adequately soundproofed and handicapped accessible.</p>
<p>Guest rooms will be individually occupied. All must have flat screen TVs, included Internet access, and be contemporary, handicapped accessible, and able to offer refrigerators upon request. Guest rooms must be provided at a rate at or below the Government approved rate of $120/night. A list of attendees will be provided at the time of contract award to create the reservations. The entire event including guest rooms will be contracted and invoiced against as a single contract. Attendees will furnish a credit card at check-in for incidentals and personal expenses only. One upgraded guest room is requested to be provided at the Government approved rate of $120/night and must be large enough to accommodate small informal meetings of 10-12 people. The total estimated number of guest rooms needed per night is:</p>

<p>The hotel shall guarantee SBA participants' guest room reservations and rates for five business days prior to scheduled event.</p>
<p>Due to the Agency's mission to be able to provide immediate support to America's small business community on a moment's notice, SBA requires flexibility in its ability to change the number of participants' guest rooms reserved. SBA will guarantee 85% occupancy rate of its participants' guest room without penalty.</p>
<p>Hotel on-site parking available to accommodate 20 participants' vehicles at no additional charge.</p>

All meals/food/beverage costs are not to exceed the federal governments' Denver per diem rates ($12.00-$15.00 - breakfast, $18.00-$22.50 - lunch) per day excluding service charges. Meals will be served (either buffet style or plated) at predetermined times as during normal meal hours as agreed upon by the hotel and SBA's on-site representative. SBA's training schedule will indicate planned meal hours. SBA's on-site representative will confirm meal plan hour with hotel's representative at least one week prior to training start date. However, due to the nature of training, the parties anticipate the need to have some reasonable flexibility in actual meal schedules as not to disrupt the training.</p>
<p>Fast and easy check-in and check-out capabilities are required. With 150 conference attendees arriving at the property at one time, hotel must have a plan/staff to have check-in/check-out move quickly and efficiently. Luggage storage is required if guestrooms are not available for early check-in (11:00 am arrival). The hotel shall allow confirmed guest reservations to arrive up until 11:00 pm of the first day. SBA may require the front desk to hand out an informational welcome flyer to the attendees upon check-in. Express check-out via guestroom TV or under guestroom door invoicing is desired.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, hotel will provide SBA's on-site representatives a telephone directory of "key" hotel personnel assigned to supporting SBA during the conference. The telephone directory must include "key" personnel's business hours and telephone numbers (note a telephone answering service is not acceptable). At a minimum, the key personnel must be identified for check-in/out, guest room accommodations, audio-visual support, meal services, and conference room setup.</p>

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: One year (extension optional)<br />7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: USAID/CENTRAL ASIAN REPUBLICS, Almaty, Kazakhstan <br />8. JOB DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>A) Background</p>
<p>The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asian Republics is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with country offices in Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan, as well as provides full range of programmatic and administrative management support for USAID Representative Office in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan. Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.</p>
<p>The Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible for the strategic planning, program design and implementation, achievement of results, and reporting for the USAID assistance programs for the five Central Asian Republics. The U.S. Government's program of assistance in the region is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources, including energy; and improved primary healthcare. It ranks as one of the Agency's largest programs, with funding levels that have averaged over $115 million annually. The Mission implements its programs together with more than 80 implementing organizations funded via acquisition and/or assistance mechanisms. The staff manages a program that addresses six program areas principally focused on assisting these former communist states in making the transition to Western-style democracies with viable market economies.</p>
<p>The Mission currently has three technical offices: Office of Economic Development (EDO), Democracy and Governance (DGO), and Health and Education (HEO) and is in the process of developing and implementing its new whole-of government strategy for each country and the region for 2011-2016 that will create greater focus of our development efforts and require significant restructuring of our implementation portfolio.</p>
<p>It is a challenging work environment and this position requires an experienced professional, technically qualified individual who can exercise sound judgment, and can articulate and uphold the Agency's strategic objectives and goals within the broader context of the USG foreign policy objectives in a diverse and constantly changing environment.</p>
<p>B) BASIC FUNCTION OF THE POSITION:</p>
<p>The incumbent will serve as Acting Director of the Strategy and Program Office (SPO) for USAID/Central Asian Republics (CAR), exercising the full authorities of that position and responsible for the full range of responsibilities attributed to the position. In coordination with the Regional Deputy Mission Director, s/he will provide day-to-day management oversight of all mission activities and programs. S/he will work with USAID staff from all five USAID/CAR Country Offices - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - to advance USAID's programmatic and management interests.</p>
<p>During this time, the contractor will be in charge of the day-to-day management of the SPO office and will coordinate closely with the Regional Deputy Mission Director. Illustrative duties will include the overall supervision of six Foreign Service Nationals and mentoring/coaching five U.S. Direct Hire Junior Officers (note: the Junior Officers while assigned to the SPO, do not fill specific SPO positions as they are in training status and spend a lot of time doing rotations in other offices/Country Offices); follow up on new project designs and drafting Activity Approval Documents; draft narrative sections for the 2011 Operational Plan and Mission Strategy and Resource Plan, Performance Report and other documents as required in conjunction with USAID/CAR's three technical offices and five Country Offices; and other routine program office duties. The contractor will serve as mentor to the Junior Program Officers and the incoming Deputy Program Officer.</p>
<p>Other tasks will include preparation and review of scene-setters and related documents for VIP visitors, managing logistical arrangements for site visits, preparing talking points for high-level meetings, ensuring that note-taking is carried out for government-to-government meetings and managing all necessary follow-up actions, including the preparation of cables, reports to USAID/Washington, and responses to various inquiries and requests from high-level visitors.</p>
<p>Upon completion of his/her assignment, the incumbent will brief USAID/CAR senior management on the principal issues that arose and how they were dealt with.</p>
<p>C) Supervision Received <br /><br />The PSC Strategy and Program Office Director will report to the USAID/CAR Regional Deputy Mission Director. Under broad USAID/CAR Mission guidance work is performed with a very high degree of independence and is reviewed only for adherence to administrative policy of the Agency and for assurance that the broad, technical objectives have been fulfilled. The incumbent will keep the Mission informed of progress/and problems/issues, his/her recommendations are considered authoritative and are not reviewed technically.</p>
<p>D) Supervision Exercised</p>
<p>The incumbent will provide technical guidance and supervision to the USAID/Central Asia/Strategy and Program Office employees - one Internationally Recruited USPSC and six FSNPSC program development professional and one administrative support staff.</p>

<p>&nbsp;APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS</p>
<p>1. Attachment 1 Specifications</p>
<p>Submission of Invoices (April 2011)</p>
<p><br />(a) Background: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) partners with the United States Coast Guard Finance Center for financial services in support of TSA operations, including the payment of contractor invoices. Therefore, all contractor invoices must be submitted to, and will be paid by, the U.S. Coast Guard Finance Center (FinCen).</p>
<p>(b) Invoice Submission Method: Invoices may be submitted via facsimile, U.S. Mail, or email. Contractors shall utilize ONLY ONE method per invoice submission. The submission information for each of the methods is as follows in order of preference:</p>
<p>1) Facsimile number is: 757-413-7314</p>
<p>The facsimile number listed above shall be used by contractors for ORIGINAL invoice submission only. If facsimile submission is utilized, contractors shall not submit hard copies of invoices via the U.S. mail. It is the responsibility of the contractor to verify that invoices are received, regardless of the method of submission used. Contractors may inquire regarding the receipt of invoices by contacting the U.S. Coast Guard Finance Center via the methods listed in subparagraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>2) U.S. Mail: <br />United States Coast Guard Finance Center <br />TSA Commercial Invoices <br />P.O. Box 4111 <br />Chesapeake, VA 23327-4111</p>
<p>3) Email Invoices: <br />FIN-SMB-TSAInvoices@uscg.mil or www.fincen.uscg.mil<br /><br />(c) Invoice Process: Upon receipt of contractor invoices, FinCen will electronically route invoices to the appropriate TSA Contracting Officer's Technical Representative and/or Contracting Officer for review and approval. Upon approval, the TSA will electronically route the invoices back to FinCen. Upon receipt of certified invoices from an Authorized Certifying Official, FinCen will initiate payment of the invoices.</p>
<p>Note for discounts offered:</p>
<p>Discounts on invoices. If desired, the Contractor should offer discounts directly upon the invoice submitted, clearly specifying the terms of the discount. Contractors can structure discounted amounts for payment for any time period less than the usual thirty day payment period specified under Prompt Payment requirements; however the Contractor should not structure terms for payment of net amounts invoiced any sooner than the standard period required under FAR Subpart 32.9 regarding prompt payments for the specified deliverables under contract.</p>
<p><br />Discounts offered after invoice submission. If the Contractor should wish to offer a discount on a specific invoice after its submission for payment, the Contractor should submit a letter to the Finance Center identifying the specific invoice for which a discount is offered and specify the exact terms of the discount offered and what time period the Government should make payment by in order to receive the discount. The Contractor should clearly indicate the contract number, invoice number and date, and the specific terms of the discount offered. Contractors should not structure terms for net amount payments any sooner than the standard period required under FAR Subpart 32.9 regarding prompt payments for the specified deliverables under contract.</p>
<p>(d) Payment Status: Contractors may inquire on the payment status of an invoice by any of the following means:</p>
<p>(1) Via the internet: https://www.fincen.uscg.mil <br />Contacting the FinCen Customer Service Section via telephone at 1-800-564-5504 or (757) 523-6940 (Voice Option #1). The hours of operation for the Customer Service line are 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM Eastern Time, Monday through Friday. However, the Customer Service line has a voice-mail feature that is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.</p>
<p>(2) Via the Payment Inquiry Form: https://www.fincen.uscg.mil/secure/payment.htm</p>
<p>(e) Invoice Elements: Invoices will automatically be rejected if the information required in subparagraph (a)(2) of the Prompt Payment Clause, contained in this Section of the Contract, including EFT banking information, Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and DUNS number are not included in the invoice. All invoices must clearly correlate invoiced amounts to the corresponding contract line item number and funding citation. The Contractor shall work with the Government to mutually refine the format, content and method of delivery for all invoice submissions during the performance of the Contract.</p>
<p>(f) Supplemental Invoice Documentation: Contractors shall submit all supplemental invoice documentation (e.g. copies of subcontractor invoices, travel vouchers, etc) necessary to approve an invoice along with the original invoice. The Contractor invoice must contain the information stated in the Prompt Payment Clause in order to be received and processed by FinCen. Supplemental invoice documentation required for review and approval of invoices may, at the written direction of the Contracting Officer, be submitted directly to either the Contracting Officer, or the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-1 INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Additional clauses/provisions in full text)</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS. (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-(A) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have &#10063; have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are &#10063; are not &#10063; presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; (D) Have &#10063;, have not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has &#10063; has not &#10063;, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious,or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of provision)</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

Midgette, (252) 335-6943, Sheila.G.Midgette@uscg.mil.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

It is the responsibility of the contractor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions. The NAICS code is 541410 and the small business standard is $7.0. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses. This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.
 It is Governments intent to issue a single award to satisfy the requirement.

There will be a site visit conducted for this requirement at the Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, NC on June 15, 2011 at 9:00am EST. All attendees must be United States Citizens and must register at the pass & id office prior to entry onto the base.

Site visit Location:

63 Lucy Brewer Avenue, bldg 63
Camp Lejeune, NC 28542

The Legal Services Support Section (LSSS) requires an upgrade to an existing courtroom (Courtroom 64-2), with an option to upgrade an additional courtroom (Courtroom 63-2).  The upgrade includes replacing the existing audio/visual system with state-of-the-art technology, replacing existing furniture, replacing existing carpeting with specified floor coverings, and other minor renovations as required to accomplish proper installation and acoustics for the above items.
  The attached Statement of Work is broken down into three sections (Audio Video System, Flooring Coverings, Furniture) that represent the minimum government requirement.  It is not, however, the government's intent to specify the precise equipment, items, or method to accomplish this upgrade.  Rather, the government's desire is to invite prospective vendors to visit and view the existing courtrooms, and submit their own innovative approach towards meeting the LSSS's requirement.  All quotes will be evaluated on the basis of best value according to the evaluation criteria established in the solicitation.

BASIS OF AWARD:
A vendors quote must be written in a logical, practical, clear, concise and logically assembled manner, containing all pertinent information in sufficient detail to provide the evaluators with a clear understanding of the vendors approach and to permit evaluation of the proposed program.
  It is the responsibility of the vendor to present enough information to allow the various work efforts, support, and management approaches to be meaningfully evaluated without discussions.  
The vendors initial quote should contain the vendors best terms from a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Government reserves the right to  communicate with vendors  if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  The Government may reject any or all quotations if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest quotation; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in quotations received.  A quote must be internally consistent or the quote will be considered unrealistic and may be considered unacceptable.
  Evaluation of the technical approach will be based upon the extent to which the vendor thoroughly and accurately describes the overall technical solution.  
The government will evaluate all responses received using the evaluation criteria provided to the schedule contractors. The Government will award a single contract resulting from this request for quotes to the responsible vendor whose quote, conforming to the RFQ, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Quotes will be evaluated in an efficient and minimally burdensome fashion.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to evaluate quotes without the use of formal evaluation procedures such as establishing a competitive range, conducting discussions, scoring quotations, and to make an award to other than the lowest quote.
Vendors responding to this announcement shall submit their quote in accordance with FAR 52.212-1.
 Evaluation will be based on the best value to the Government.  To be considered, vendors will be required to submit: a) Complete Specifications for each item being quoted to include brand names and model numbers, b) Warranty information, c) Drawings and pictures of furniture being offered, pictures of carpet and electronics. d) Past Performance, e) Pricing and f) Delivery and completion time frame for the project. Quotes that do not contain this information will be rejected.  By submission of this quote, the vendor certifies that all items delivered against this contract are in compliance with the Governments Terms, Conditions and specifications.
Factor 1:  Technical Capability. Including but not limited to Specifications and Corporate Experience.
 Factor 2:  Past Performance The vendor should describe no more than two (2) past performance references on contracts/purchase orders it has held within the last twelve (12) months, which are of similar scope, magnitude and complexity to that which is detailed in the RFQ or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  Vendors who present similar contracts should provide a brief explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts/purchase orders to the requirements of the RFQ. Factor 3:  Delivery. Factor 4: Price. A narrative shall be provided that shows a clear understanding of the requirement and how the experience and resources of their organization can best provide the necessary management, organizational and business improvement services necessary to carry out this requirement within the time constraints imposed.
 The Technical Capability will be evaluated based upon the extent to which the vendor concisely and accurately describes the technical solution to performing the requirements of this SOW. The submitted Technical Capability shall include, where applicable, complete explanations of procedures and the program you propose to follow. Additionally, it shall demonstrate the merit of the technical approach offered and shall be an orderly, specific, and complete document in every detail, and should demonstrate a thorough understanding of the requirement.
The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration; FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offers-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (filled in as follows):
The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible vendor whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
 The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Factor 1:  Technical Capability 
Factor 2:  Past Performance 
Factor 3: Delivery (The Government desires completion within 60 days of ARO for CLIN 0001 and 60 days for CLIN 0002 if option is exercised)
Factor 4:  Price

To evaluate price, quotes will be evaluated using a price/technical tradeoff.   This process is appropriate because it is in the Governments best interest to consider award to other than the lowest price.  When combined, all non-cost factors are more important than the price. In evaluating the technical portion of the quote, the technical evaluators will evaluate the factors as described in the Basis of Award of the RFQ.
  The factors of Technical Capability, Past Performance and Delivery are weighted equally. Technical Capability, Past Performance and Delivery, when combined, are more important than the price.    
Quoters shall provide completed copies of FAR 52.212-3 or their Online Representations and Certification Application (ORCA) record. Additionally, the quoters shall provide completed copies of DFARS 252.225-7000 with their quote. ORCA is located at http://orca.bpn.gov. The provisions and clauses can be found at FAR website: http://www.arnet.gov/far/ and DFARS website: http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfars/index.htm. Quoters are required to provide their Contractors DUNS Number and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code with their quote.
 The CAGE code entered shall be for that name and address provided by the Contractor. Vendors are required to be registered and current in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF-RA) databases. For WAWF-RA assistance, visit their website at: https://wawf.eb.mil or contact 910-451-1769.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations including the United Nations agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and man-made disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established seven permanent regional offices in the following locations: Budapest, Hungary; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Kathmandu, Nepal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand. The sub regional offices are in Almaty, Kazakhstan and the Middle East. A new sub-regional office is being considered for Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) who report to the Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington. PRAs serve as the regional team leader for all response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They primarily serve as the key interlocutor with embassies and missions in the event of a disaster but may also serve as the DART leader if needed. They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional offices, as appropriate, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Washington-based Regional Coordinators (RCs), the multi-year non-response program strategies for the their respective regions. The PRAs coordinate with OFDA/Washington on disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions. The Regional Advisors (RAs) reporting to the PRAs ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster response and assistance, strategic reporting and analysis are met. The RAs are responsible for monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded programs and activities, and formulating disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a RA for the East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region to be based in Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This RA position requires an individual who is able to travel outside of the country where they are based, on short notice for two to three weeks at a time, or longer, on occasion. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for on-going disaster activities related to disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs. The incumbent will work to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations (IOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region. The RA will be responsible for disaster analysis, program monitoring, overseeing NGO partner implementation, reporting to OFDA Washington, and liaising with USAID Missions and U.S. Embassies.</p>
<p>A) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the respective PRA, the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull; Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and assist in initial assessments of damages and needs; determine appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions, in consultation with OFDA/Washington and/or the PRA; and provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of these events;<br />&bull; Coordinate and liaise with representatives of host governments, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. Embassies, and USAID Missions to facilitate cooperation and coordination in disaster response activities;<br />&bull; Monitor DCHA/OFDA-funded activities and report in accordance with OFDA guidelines, policies, and requirements;<br />&bull; Become certified and serve as an Agreement Officer's Technical Representative (AOTR) and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) for grants, cooperative agreements and contracts;<br />&bull; Serve as required as DART Team Leader or as a DART team member during a disaster response;<br />&bull; Maintain regular communications with the regional (and/or sub-regional) office in their area of responsibility and with OFDA/Washington;<br />&bull; Prepare specific requested field information and subject reports, as required by OFDA/Washington.<br /><br />B) Disaster Preparedness - Working closely with OFDA/Washington and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the incumbent will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.</p>
<p>Specifically, the incumbent, in collaboration with OFDA regional/sub-regional team colleagues, will:</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance and response for OFDA, local governments, and other donors/organizations as appropriate;<br />&bull; Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA's efforts in disaster response and management;<br />&bull; Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the incumbent's respective Regional Office and/or sub-regional team. Support may include but is not limited to assessment/evaluation visits, project design exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;<br />&bull; Coordinate with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries and develop projects/activities for addressing these;<br />&bull; Work with representatives of local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate preparedness and mitigation into appropriate programs;<br />&bull; Prepare regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The RA will report directly to the PRA. However, for certain activities, the RA will coordinate tasks with the respective RC in OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The PRA will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives. The RA is expected to act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>
<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><strong>Changes Outline:</strong><br />- The due date for final quote submission has been extended one week to allow for increased competition. It is now June 17, 2011. See below for more details.<br />- Accordingly, the estimated start date for the period of performance has also been pushed to June 27, 2011.<br /><br /><br />***<br /><br />The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) located on the Naval Support Activity Bethesda (NSA Bethesda) - formerly known as the National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) - in Bethesda, Maryland, has a requirement for a comprehensive five-year assessment of the Vice President for Finance and Administration. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This request for quotes (RFQ) for commercial services is in accordance with FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  It will be the responsibility of the offeror to check the website, http://www.fbo.gov, for the issuance of any amendments to the solicitation. This RFQ incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-51.
<p>This requirement is set aside for small businesses under NAICS code 541612. See attached provisions and clauses. The Government will award a single award, firm fixed price contract. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To be eligible for contract award, an offeror must register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)</span>.</strong> For instructions on registering with CCR and ORCA, please see their respective websites at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx and https://orca.bpn.gov/.</p>
<p><strong>Budget: </strong>The budget for this requirement is $50,000.00.</p>
<p><strong>Requirement &amp; Background: </strong><br />The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) has a requirement for a comprehensive assessment of the performance of the Vice President for Finance and Administration of the University (VP for Finance and Administration) over the past five years.  USUHS wishes to employ the services of a nationally recognized professional with experience and expertise in finance, budgeting, planning and administration for an academic health center/medical school administration.</p>
<p>The University President established the requirement that each of the University's senior leadership would undergo a comprehensive performance assessment at the completion of their fifth year of service to the University. A comprehensive assessment for the VP for Finance and Administration has not been accomplished to date - only annual self-assessments. The requirement calls for a qualified outside contractor to lead a team of selected members from USUHS in completing  interviews and a comprehensive review of the VP of Finance and Administration's performance against the goals he established and were subsequently approved by the University President. There will be an administrative executive identified to work with the contractor selected and assist in coordinating the internal administrative support needed by the selected quote. The offeror is expected to develop a plan that will be reviewed by USUHS personnel prior to its execution. The outside contractor will then provide the final assessment in written and presentation form to the University President.</p>
<p><strong>University Information:</strong><br />Established by U.S. Congress in 1972 under the Department of Defense, this federally funded university educates and trains uniformed services scientists and healthcare practitioners for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, U.S. Public Health Service and the Veterans Administration. The University's F. Edward H&eacute;bert School of Medicine (SOM), the Graduate School of Nursing (GSN), Naval Postgraduate Dental Colleges and the Armed Forces Radiobiological Research Institute are located on the campus of the Naval Support Activity Bethesda (formerly known as the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland).  The Air Force Postgraduate Dental College is located in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p>Doctoral and master's degrees in the biomedical sciences and public health are awarded by interdisciplinary and department-based graduate programs within the School of Medicine. Program strengths include infectious disease, neuroscience, psychology and preventive medicine research. A large number of graduates are military officers and/or serve the federal biomedical research enterprise. The Graduate School of Nursing offers a Master of Science in Nursing degree in Nurse Anesthesia, Family Nurse Practitioner, Perioperative Clinical Nursing, Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner, and a full - and part-time program for a Ph.D. in Nursing Science.  The Naval and Air Force Postgraduate Dental Colleges offer a course of instruction for a Master of Science degree in Oral Biology.  The Armed Forces Radiobiological Research Institute collaborates with other government facilities, academic institutions, and civilian laboratories in the United States and other countries to research the biological effects of ionizing radiation. In addition, it provides medical training and emergency response to manage incidents related to radiation exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of Work:</strong><br />The assessment shall be based upon interviews with selected individuals and a review of the VP for Finance and Administration's performance.</p>
<p>The contractor will consult with the President, USU to:</p>

<p>4.       <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Price</span> - <strong>Offerors must provide a firm fixed price quote.</strong> The budget for this requirement id $50,000.00.

<DESC>The PRE-SOLICITATION of FA8126-11-Q-0281 is being temporarily put on hold. We are working on getting better descriptions of the items described in the draft SF 1449. We expect to update all files by 17 Jun 2011.&nbsp; No response is needed. The draft SF 1449 is just that, a draft and the dates will be changed to reflect correct due by dates when the watermark is removed and this moves out of pre-solicitation into the solicitation phase. We are also contemplating making this a small business set a side.

<DESC>This amendment is to modify the RFI instruction. No other changes.<br /><br />This RFI is set aside for Small Business.<br />Description of Services/Supplies: Next Generation Genome Sequencing Bioinformatics Pipeline
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) to identify the capabilities of the marketplace of all interested parties. This is not a request for Proposals.<br /><br />This request is for information and planning purposes as part of market survey only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any future solicitation. No official solicitation exists; therefore, please do not request a copy of a solicitation. If in the future an official solicitation is released, there is no guarantee that sources responding to this RFI will be included on the source list. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.</p>
<p>The FDA makes no implied or in fact contract by issuing this RFI. Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the FDA's view of the information received. Do not send any material that requires a non-disclosure agreement or that may be business sensitive. Responses received that include a non-disclosure agreement or identify information that is business sensitive will not be accepted. Responses to this notice will not be returned.</p>
<p>1. Mission and Objectives</p>
<p>Whole genome DNA sequencing (WGS) with next generation platforms is no longer restricted to large sequencing centers but can be conducted in private laboratories with relative ease. In addition, these platforms no longer come with the "big science" price tag of millions but can be fairly inexpensive (as little as $60k) with prices becoming all the more competitive. However, these newer systems yield raw sequencing reads that require significant bioinformatic expertise to utilize, manipulate, and ultimately conduct comparative assessments considering the size and volume of a given data set. Adding to the complexity is the evolving scale of information to be extracted from the massive sequencing datasets indicative of the starting material: from single strain, mixed populations, and extending into full metagenomic communities. From a general perspective, WGS is becoming entrenched in the near future as the state-of-the-art gold standard and will require individual laboratory competency and utility in this area. It is clear that the current bottleneck is secondary and tertiary extraction/derivatives of the information that currently requires highly trained bioinformatics personnel. It is ultimately a cost benefit to automate the process pipeline to translate raw sequence to useable and recognizable data based on comparative assessments.</p>
<p>This work may ultimately support and integrate WGS data, in a modular fashion, into the Pathogen Annotated Tracking and Resource Network (PATRN) that is currently under contract in CFSAN/OARSA/DVA. Certainly, a variation on this fundamental need can translate into the functional genomics realm to enumerate, categorize, and characterize in true digital quantity and quality changes occurring at the RNA level. In aggregate, this work supports FDA/CFSAN related-mission to delineate and/or develop methodology for the microbiological and molecular identification of foodborne pathogenic bacteria. In addition, this pipeline may allow unique markers to surface rapidly that are important not only in identification and subtyping but relate to host or food reservoir.</p>
<p>Deliverables</p>
<p>The desired deliverable for this requisition would involve a simplified (point and click) bioinformatic software-based utility package for handling/integrating raw genomic sequence data reads from a next generation sequencing platform. The utility package would essentially convert raw reads with proper interfacing with genomic sequence databases (such as GenBank) into easily identifiable DNA polymorphisms with functional genomic annotation information as outlined in the statement of work.</p>
<p>2. Period of Performance/Basis <br />10/1/2011 To 09/30/2012</p>
<p>3. Source Selection Procedures/Criteria</p>
<p>The equipment must meet the technical requirements listed under the SOW/PWS. The evaluation factors for this solicitation will be the ability to meet the technical requirements, compatibility with existing systems and past performance will comprise the major percentage of the evaluation factors. The Government reserves the right to select the system that will offer best value. The vendor will have an established record of being able to service their systems, provide technical assistance and have the service contracts available for additional funding. Award will be made to the party whose quote offers the best value to the Government, technical, price, and other factors considered. The Government may award this purchase order to other than the lowest price technically acceptable quote. The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Requirement," and 2) Price. Technical Capability is significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>4. EIT. <br />Approval of the OPDIV/OS Section 508 Official or designee is required when claiming an exception to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (see the HHS Section 508 policy at http://www.hhs.gov/od/508policy/index.html )</p>
<p>This may ultimately support and integrate whole genome sequencing into the Pathogen Annotated Tracking and Resource Network (PATRN) that is currently under contract in CFSAN/OARSA/DVA.<br /><br />Statement of Work (SOW)/Performance Work Statement (PWS)</p>

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Systems Command has a requirement to provide all maintenance, logistics services, and materials required to support and maintain a total of 121 TH-57B and TH-57C aircraft. One hundred nineteen (119) TH-57B and TH-57C aircraft are based at Naval Air Station (NAS) Whiting Field, Florida and are utilized to train student naval aviators in the fundamentals of helicopter flight for transition to operational fleet aircraft in the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Coast Guard, and selected international armed forces. Two TH-57C aircraft are operated at NAS Patuxent River, MD. These helicopters perform utility, training, and photo-chase missions. Increases in the Pilot Training Requirement during the contract period may necessitate up to five inactive aircraft to be returned to active status. The TH-57 is the Navy's basic helicopter for undergraduate pilot training. The contractor will provide services and materials for organizational, intermediate and depot level maintenance. The contractor also provides services such as maintenance management, material management, and engineering support. The contractor repair facilities are certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 145. Replacement parts and life-limited components are procured via FAA certified sources. This support is currently being performed under contract N00019-05-D-0023 awarded to L-3 Communications Vertex Aerospace, LLC. The period of performance for the upcoming requirement will be a total of five years. It is anticipated that this period of performance will consist of one base period and nineteen quarterly option periods. The contract will not be an indefinite-delivery type contract, which differs from the current TH-57 Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contract. The solicitation and resultant contract will include a mix of contract line item types, such as Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Cost Reimbursable, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), and Labor Hours (LH). The USN intends to include performance incentives.</p>
<p>A draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached to this synopsis. Additional sections of the Draft RFP will be posted as they become available and instructions for industry comment will be provided at that time. Award is planned for 4th Quarter FY12. Please note that all prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) database http://www.ccr.gov in order to participate in this procurement.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION. IT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS POSTING. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THE DRAFT SOLICITATION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Training Systems Division, Orlando (hereinafter NAWC TSD) is responsible for acquisition, fielding and life cycle support of Navy and Marine Corps aviation training systems suitable for effective training.  Life cycle support includes ensuring the availability of an initial material support package at time of device fielding and the acquisition of spare and repair parts attributable to device modifications and upgrades.  These Navy and Marine Corps aviation training systems spare and repair parts are the focus of this notice, pending issuance of Class Justification and Approval CJA_11_6629.  NAWC TSD intends on negotiating and awarding multiple spare and repair buys on a sole source basis from 6 March 2011 through 7 March 2012.
  The total estimated amount of these purchases is expected to approach $12,500,000.  The Navy and Marine Corps aviation training systems Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) platforms and major subsystems to which this synopsis applies are annotated in Attachment (A).  While this synopsis serves as a pre-solicitation notice of the sole source acquisitions for spare and repair parts from the OEMs listed in Attachment (A), it is not intended to preclude the Government from acquiring spare and repair parts through the training system design/build contractor, as this strategy may serve the Government's best interest.  Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulations 6.302, the proposed contract actions are for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and only negotiate with Attachment (A) sources.
  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, interested parties not identified within Attachment (A) are encouraged to express their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.   Responses to this Sources Sought notice shall be received no later than fifteen (15) days from the posting date.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether respondents should be added to Attachment (A).  In those situations where the Government determines that identical parts are available from more than one source, it will compete these acquisitions among the identified sources.  A determination by the Government not to compete these proposed contract actions based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Amendment #1
VA-101-11-RP-0115
June 7, 2011

The following are questions asked by prospective offerors:

Q1.  The ad focuses on Landscape Architects & Architects when it appears the majority of the work is Civil Engineering. Do you think that the solicitation will show a Licensed Civil Engineer for the lead firm as an equivalent to a LA &/or Arch? 

Answer:  The NAICs codes for this announcement are only for firms with Architect and Landscape  Architects as stated in the announcement. 

  
Q2. Is the pored-place concrete crypts in the scope of work a typo? 

Answer:  Yes.  This is a typographical error.  It should read "pre-place concrete crypts".


Q3. I know that a site will not be chosen before the qualification submittal but will one be chosen before short list presentations?   

Answer:  We will provide any available site information to the short list selectees.  


Q4.  I have a question regarding the above subject solicitation. The solicitation states the following: "Prime contractor shall have licensed/registered landscape architects as members of the firm, or team, with experience in the planning and design of cemeteries, large institutional campuses, parks and recreational facilities, or similar land development projects. The vertical structures for the project shall be designed by a licensed architectural firm having a practicing office within the State of Florida."
And "A/E firms mustbe licensed in the State of Florida."
I interpret these requirements as follows:
1.	The prime contractor must have landscape architects employed by the firm OR employed by firms that are part of the prime contractor's team.  
Answer:  The prime contractor must have landscape architects or architect employed by the firm.

2.	The prime contractor must either be a licensed architectural firm or must have a licensed architectural firm on the prime contractor's team to design the vertical structures. 
Answer: The prime contractor must be a licensed architectural firm as stated in the announcement.

3.	The prime contractor must be licensed to conduct business in the State of Florida.  
Answer:  Yes.  Also the prime contractor must have a record of established   business 

	Q5.  Must applicants have an established working office within 100 miles of Tallahassee, FL?

        Answer:  Yes, The prime contractor must have a working office and established record of business, prior to award.

<p>Q20. I saw the notice. Is that the Solicitation posted? When will the final Solicitation be posted? What does it mean that the SOW is available but not the Solicitation? Why is the Solicitation posted? Will the Solicitation be posted tomorrow?<br />A20. Please put your questions in an email and do not call me. Answering one person's questions and not providing the answers to everyone at the same time could be seen as favoring one company or another; it is also an enormous drain on my time. Please, only submit via email. Portions of the draft solicitation were posted. The classified documents are available beginning June 08. The difference in availability is due to multiple requirements on my time. Parts of the Solicitation will be posted as they are not classified; the classified portions, such as the SOW are not posted. The Solicitation will be posted as soon as possible.</p>

<DESC>OST is modernizing its airplane fleet by replacing one Gulfstream, two Twin Otters and three DC-9s with Boeing 737-400 airplanes. As the new airplanes come on board, OST is incorporating several program enhancements to improve aviation program efficiencies, effectiveness, safety, and to meet Federal Management Regulation FMR 102-33 and other Title 14 CFR and agency requirements. One of the enhancements requires a maintenance and logistics tracking program that is integrated in the FOS. <br />Daniel Systems, Computerized Aircraft Management Program (CAMP) is the only provider which has all the required modules necessary to administer a safe and cost efficient maintenance program and is compatible with the FOS. These modules allow for automated maintenance and parts tracking program capable of supporting simple labor or parts utilization reports, aircraft maintenance requirement reports and can determine complex performance metrics required by DOE Order 440.2B. Daniel Systems "CAMP" accommodates several aircraft inspection programs and uses GSA-US Government aircraft cost accounting principles to improve development of required reports such as quarterly GSA-Federal Aircraft Interactive Reporting System (FAIRS).
<p>In addition to providing for aircraft maintenance and logistics tracking, CAMP also provides the following functionality which will result in additional efficiencies and cost savings:</p>
<p>1. Inspection Program with revision services. OST currently pays for this service through each of the aircraft manufacturers who administer the inspection program for the respective model aircraft. Through CAMP these programs will be incorporated into one program.<br />2. Inspection Task Cards with revision services. The task cards will be computerized and can be printed with each specific job task. This reduces the mechanic's material reference time by issuing the task card reference with the job task.<br />3. Monthly Maintenance Reports and Forms. The program is capable of producing multiple reports as required by OST.<br />4. Maintenance Analyst Support.<br />5. Airworthiness Directive Monitoring and Reporting. Each Airworthiness Directive, Service Bulletin, and Service Letter can be managed through the CAMP program verses management through each aircraft manufacturer.<br />6. Inspection Package Forecasting and Preparation.<br />7. Electronic Logbooks. OST will be able to automate aircraft cockpits through electronic logbook that are also compatible with the FOS. <br />8. Interface with the FOS flight management program to ensure 100% accuracy of data and flight time transfer.</p>
<p>With the integration of the CAMP management system into the FOS, additional program savings will be realized by having one source for administering the aircraft inspection programs for each model aircraft and one source of data input and output. Currently aircraft operations and maintenance data is listed into several databases which must all be verified for accuracy with each entry. This is inefficient and has the potential for inaccurate data, failure of operation, and is not conducive with safe, effective and efficient aviation operations.</p>
<p>The proposed contract term includes a basic period of performance of one year with four one-year option periods.</p>

This request is for the upgrade software to make the equipment compatible with the hardware we presently own and cannot use because it needs the upgrades. There is an estimated time of delivery of 30 to 60 days.
4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  41 USC 253(g), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1  

( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy

5. Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority

The FAR 6.302-1 exception to full and open competition applies as VRMagic is the sole direct subsidiary of the parent company VRMagic GmbH, which developes and manufacturers the EyeSI system and is the only contractor with the requisite knowledge, experience and technical data that can meet the Government's requirements on a timely basis.



6. Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  
Market research was conducted and found that only VRMagic could provide software upgrades to the Eyesi simulator.

7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.
The Contracting Officer determines that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable because a complete analysis of all costs or a price analysis will be fully utilized prior to award of the contract.


8. Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
A search of GSa vendors, SDVOSB vendors under the NAICS code 333319, and a CCR search found that no other company could provide this software.

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  
The Houston VA Medical Center purchased the Eysi Hardware platform previously. Since then the need to upgrade the software arised and the this type of software is proprietarty to each eye surgery simulator. VRMagic is the proprietary vendor that provides this software.

<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in; mso-layout-grid-align: none">The Government owns the legacy messaging portion of the NGC software. This software is completely unique and was specifically developed to run on the CSC suite of equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Replacement of the CSC message-switching suite with new hardware which could be maintained by another vendor is not a viable option for several reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First, the physical plant, which belongs to CSC, took a long time to install and debug. It <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>includes legacy computers, circuit interfaces, crypto interfaces, fiber optic interfaces, cables, frames, connectors, cabinets, power supplies, power panels, clocking equipment, circuit selection equipment Tech Control consoles, Operations consoles, Maintenance consoles, monitors, printers, alarm panels, test equipment, and patch panels. The replacement of the CSC physical plant would cost several millions of dollars and take up to a year to design, install and debug.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, the design and installation of a replacement system would have to consider the separation of the Intelligence Community message traffic from the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">General Service (GENSER)</span> community message traffic, which adds to the installation costs. Second, there would be a major expense of re-writing and re-hosting the Government-owned messaging software.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Due to system security constraints, the messaging software operates without a commercial operating system and was therefore developed specifically for the existing hardware suite.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result, moving it to a new hardware suite would involve a virtually total re-write. Third, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and National Security Agency (NSA) would have to recertify the system software and hardware for processing of Top Secret Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), as required supporting the IC's NGC messaging requirements. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This development, recertification and associated reaccreditation would be a complex, elongated, costly, and extremely high risk effort. To minimize the impact to DMS and the legacy subscribers, an effort to replace the current software and hardware suite would need to be accomplished in parallel with current operations, which would double the current operations/maintenance costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is neither funding nor resources available to initiate such an effort at the present time.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">Another scenario would be to purchase both the data rights and the assets from CSC, thereby increasing the cost to DISA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no realistic incentive for the Vendor to offer this equipment and data rights to the Government at a price favorable to the Government, even if funds could be made available to make such a purchase.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Means would also have to be provided to train the new Vendor's maintenance staff, again, a significant cost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, there is an increased performance risk to the Government, since a new Vendor might have difficulty maintaining 99.9% availability and reasonably claim that the technical data provided by the Government was inadequate to perform the maintenance function.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="tab-stops: .5in"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>d.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating the conditions under which the highly specialized maintenance of the NGC could be competed is not feasible, given pre-existing circumstances of assets, proprietary data, and Government software that meets specialized security requirements and operates only with the unique existing hardware suite. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Even if the Government were to purchase the assets and technical data, substantial duplication of cost would result, and it is improbable that the Government would receive any cost benefit or enhance its ability to perform the mission of operating the NGC by competing the requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>CSC is the only vendor that can reasonably perform maintenance services for the NGC at a reasonable price.</p>

<p>Obtaining the system operational synergy required to sustain the NGC, while ensuring continued interoperability with DMS messaging, requires an integrated approach to system maintenance management, as well as broad system level expertise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>CSC is uniquely qualified to assume this role.</p>
