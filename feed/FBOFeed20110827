SOW:  Elevator Controller Installation, Building #68, Poly trauma
Background: 
The existing controller which was installed when the building was completed does not meet current elevator inspection requirements. The controller is not properly marked as to circuit locations, and the proprietary nature of the circuit board makes it impossible for any company other than the one that installed to perform repairs or troubleshoot failures. 
Requirement: 
Contractor will provide a non-proprietary controller. The controller will utilize Microprocessor Computer Logic Control, with the elevator Control Program contained in a non-volatile, programmable, read only memory. Controller shall be constructed such that future alterations in elevator operation and programming may be made by altering the Read Only memory. The safety circuits shall be monitored and controlled by the programmable logic control for redundant protection. The entire controller shall be in an approved enclosure. The vendor will furnish the new controller and shall include all NEW associated wiring. The existing fixtures (hoist way and car equipment not normally found in the controller) will remain in place to be re-used. The aforementioned fixtures meet the current codes, and are not the issue.
The work schedule will have to be determined. Since the second floor is clinical space, with handicapped patients on a regular basis coming and going, the repair has to be well planned. Estimates are that it will take at least two days to perform the work, and then the elevator must be tested and inspected. The Vendor will provide the inspector and perform all necessary testing associated with the controller replacement. 
The replacement of the controller must be performed without disrupting the patient care operations which are ongoing.
Special Requirements:  
All work shall be performed by fully qualified contractor personnel. The VA reserves the right to reject any of the contractor's personnel and refuse them permission to work on VA property for good cause. Contractor's employees must be aware that work is in a hospital environment and courtesy must be extended to patients and visitors. Work shall be coordinated to minimize impact to hospital operations.
Delivery:
  The contractor shall coordinate all work in advance with the Electric Shop Supervisor (Bill Hagen) (813) 972-2000 ext 6441.   
Methodology: 
Similar jobs and equipment required.  Need to consider the proprietary nature of Elevator Controls

SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING :
On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time. 
TRAINING:
a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior Training.
(1) Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Rules of Behavior. 
b. The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COTR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required. 
c. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete. 
The Certification and Accreditation (C&A) requirements do not apply and a Security Accreditation Package is not required for this SOW.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.

(i)	TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT
(ii)	DELIVERY SCHEDULE
(iii)	PRICE

Offerors' proposals will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.
  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  

(b.)  Only those Offers which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) and delineated in SOW will be further evaluated under Factors (ii), and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating the offers determined under factor (i) to be technically acceptable combined with factor (ii) delivery schedule to be approximately of equal importance with Factor (iii), PRICE.

(c.)  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the options(s).
 Failure to propose on the base and all options years will render the offeror ineligible for award.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. 

(d.)  At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.

<DESC><p>THIS AMENDMENT IS TO POST&nbsp;THE FINAL QUESTIONS AND ANSWER RECEIVED TO THIS RFQ.&nbsp; NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WILL BE RESPONDED TO.&nbsp; <br /><br />QUESTION: The tubes are titanium. Are any of the other components made from titanium? <br />ANSWER: No, tubes are the only titanium componet.</p>
<p>QUESTION: How are the tubes attached to the tubesheets? <br />ANSWER: Was not answered.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Welding, rolling, or both?<br />ANSWER: Welded.</p>
<p>QUESTION: What type of refrigerant is being used? (this affects the sizing of the tube bundle).<br />ANSWER: Refrigerant is 404A</p>
<p>QUESTION: What is the flow rate of the water being chilled? (again affects sizing &amp; material selection for baffles).<br />ANSWER: 150 gpm</p>
<p>QUESTION: The sketch provided shows the (2) outlet pipes as 1 1/8" diameter, but the RFQ description indicates they should be 2 1/8" diameter.<br />ANSWER: One pipe at 2 1/8" and two pipes at 1 1/8"</p>
<p>QUESTION: The sketch indicates that the external supports may be fabricated from 304 stainless steel, but the RFQ states that only 316 SS may be used; this is only a cost issue.<br />ANSWER: Pipe supports may be 304 ss</p>
<p>QUESTION: The sketch shows (2) conflicting arrangements of the suction &amp; outlet nozzle locations; which view is correct?<br />ANSWER: The length view of the drawing is correct. The 1 1/8'' pipes are on the flanged side of the vessel.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Typically for heat exchangers, there is a "TEMA" design sheet which lists the quantity of the tubes required as well as wall thickness. Do you know if this exists for this project?<br />ANSWER: Tube size is 5/8''. Connections are stainless steel on the heat exchanger refrigerant and water ends. Copper can be used to connect to the stainless steel on the refrigerant side. Refrigerant will be 404A. Heat exchanger will chill sea water at a flow rate of 150 gpm from 60 to 55 F.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Can we find out the thermal data that the heat exchangers will be working at? <br />ANSWER: Chilling seawater 150 gpm 60 F down to 55 F.</p>
