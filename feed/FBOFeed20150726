<DESC>INTRODUCTION: <br />THIS IS A PRE-SOLICIATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPOSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME). THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.<br /> The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support Contracts and Simplified Acquisitions Branch (SS/SA) on behalf of the National Center for Advancing Translational Services (NCATS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order without providing for full and open competition (including brand-name) to Chembridge Corporation at 11199 Sorrento Valley RD, Suite 206, San Diego, CA 92121 for small molecules from the CORE library, to be included in the NCATS screening libraries. The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-2015-PSOL565 and the solicitation is issued as a pre-solicitation notice of intent to award on a sole-source basis. <br /> NORTH AERMICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE:<br /> The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 325199 with a Size Standard of 1000 Employees. <br /> REGULATORY AUTHORITY:<br /> The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-83, dated July 2, 2015. <br /> This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1 (b) (1), Soliciting from a single source and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  Contracts awarded using FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competition Requirements.<br /> STATUTORY AUTHORITY:<br /> This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C 3304(a)(1) under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(i)(A)- Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  <br />DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:<br />The National Center for Advancing Translational Services (NCATS) intends to procure, on a sole source basis, 13,500 small molecules from the CORE Library to be included in the NCATS screening libraries.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Center for Advancing Translational Services (NCATS) requires targeted small molecules to be included in the NCATS screening libraries. Adding diversity to chemical libraries is imperative to NCATS operations as NCATS screens a variety of targets against these in-house collections. Screening is the starting point in the development and knowledge obtained from screening a diverse collection. It provides the starting point of all information for medicinal chemistry's structure-activity relationship (SAR) design to synthesize novel compounds that have more desirable properties. A diverse and novel screening collection provides the backbone of our operation and is imperative for translation sciences to obtain effective small molecules with on-target effects. These small molecules have been designed around targeted activity and will have a few variations around each scaffold to best explore chemical space within the target. This will allow for a much faster SAR expansion upon completed screening and allow for a much thorough bioinformatics analysis.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure a total of 13,500 small molecules from the CORE Library, including the KINACore, IONCore, NHRCore and GPCR Library, to be included in the NCATS screening libraries.</p>
<p>Deliverables/Period of Performance:</p>
<p>Compounds shall be delivered to address below within three (3) months after receipt of Government provided barcoded vials. Requirement may be shipped in a maximum of three (3) installments.</p>
<p>9800 Medical Center Drive<br />Rockville, MD 20850</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:</p>
<p>The compounds must already exist in the Contractor's catalog to ensure that the compounds are readily available. The specific requirements are as follows:<br />1.	The Contractor must provide the NCATS DPI with 4 mg each of a total of 13,500 small molecules from the KINACore, IONCore, NHR Core and GPCR Libraries. <br />2.	The Contractor must provide small molecules that can be subdivided into separate modules that comprised of several libraries that have been designed towards biological targets of interest.<br />3.	Each small molecules must be guaranteed to have a purity of &gt;85% that is to be confirmed by HPLC/ELSD or HPLC/UV or NMR.<br />4.	The contractor must confirm identity of all compounds by MS and/or NMR.</p>
<p>5.	PLEASE NOTE: Molecules shall be provided to the NGATS in barcoded vials that shall be provided to the successful Contractor by the NCATS at time of award.</p>
<p>6.	In addition to the molecules themselves, the Contractor must provide<br />the following electronic information for each required molecule: chemical structure, compound name, molecular weight, simplified molecular-input line&shy; entry system (SMILES) or equivalent chemical structure information, accurate weight of amount of compound shipped. This information shall be provided via email referencing individual compound vial barcodes.</p>
<p>7.	The contractor must provide for shipping and handling to send small molecules in the provided vials to the NCATS.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME) DETERMINATION:</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a contract without providing for full and open competition is based upon the market research conducted as prescribed in FAR Part 10-Market Research, specifically the review and evaluation of the responses to the sources sought notice published in the FedBizOpps on July 9, 2015, synopsis number HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-SBSS-2015-571. This sources sought was posted on July 9, 2015 for the small molecules to be included in the NCATS screening libraries, for which there were no responses as of the closing date, July 15, 2015.</p>
<p>Due to the proprietary nature, with specific target activity, of these unique small molecule compounds; there are no other sources besides the proposed Contractor that can provide the requested compound library. Therefore, Chembridge Corporation is the intended source for this award.</p>
<p>CLOSING STATEMENT:</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to include ability to meet each of the project requirements, for which the party is able to provide, to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov."</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to proceed on a non-competitive basis or to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>All questions must be received by July 29, 2015 at 8:00AM and must reference number HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-2015-PSOL565.   Responses may be submitted electronically to Samantha Kelly at Samantha.Kelly2@nih.gov.</p>
