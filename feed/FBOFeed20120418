<DESC><p>This is a pre-solicitation notice for a Variable Stability in Flight Simulator.</p>
<p>The Air Force Test Pilot School requires a variable stability in flight simulator. It can be&nbsp; used to present multiple aircraft dynamic configurations to students during a single flight sortie. The needs to be modified so that it can fly like a wide variety of aircraft, and unlike ground simulations, the aircraft will provide motion cues in a flight realistic environment. The aircraft also needs to have safety limits installed on the aircraft's control system so that if an unsafe limit is approached, the aircraft will revert to the baseline (safe) aircraft dynamics.</p>
<p>The aircraft also requires the ability to implement multiple control configurations on top of the various aircraft dynamic configurations,allowing students to experience a wide variety of control implementations in a safe, controlled, and relevant flight environment. The aircraft will allow TPS to expose students to a wide range of aircraft dynamics and aircraft control configurations in a realistic environment while providing the safety net to ensue students encounter minimal risk during flight. Using this type of aircraft will allow us to fly one aircraft to demonstrate a wide range of aircraft characteristics that would otherwise require an entire stable of aircraft to demonstrate. Further, by having safety limits imposed that will return the aircraft to a baseline (safe), a safety net is created for the flights that would not exist if we were flying multiple aircraft with different dynamics on an individual basis</p>
<p><br />All interested vendors should submit information to include:<br /><br />Name of Company<br />Address<br />Phone number<br />Point of Contact<br />Cage Code or DUNS<br />Business Size<br />Brief discription of aircraft available through your company that meets the above requirements.</p>
<p>This pre-solicitation is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposal. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this notice. All respondents are reminded of the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) requirement to be considered eligible for any potential Department of Defense (DoD) contract. CCR registration information can be obtained at www.ccr.gov</p>

You may FAX or MAIL your request ATTN: CCAM-AR-A (Bldg 5300); Redstone Arsenal, AL; ATTN: Joseph Levasseur, Contract Specialist, Fax Number 256-313-8066.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  <br><br>The US Army Contracting Command-Redstone has a requirement for a one year contract with options to be awarded in fiscal year 2013 for PBL Supplies/Services and Sustainment/Operational Support for the Shadow TUAS Program.  It is anticipated that the one year contract will have a period of performance of 1 Nov 12 - 31 Oct 13 and will be awarded on contract W58RGZ-12-C-0011.  The contract will be for a performance based Contractor Managed Supply and Maintenance effort that consists of field supply support, depot level supply support, depot-level maintenance, software support, total package fielding, sustainment training, field service support, field service operations, sustainment management, PBL engineering and management, depot material repair and management, and post deployment software support.  The Sustainment/Operational Support will consist of Brigade Integration Training (BIT), New Equipment Training (NET), Presets, Resets, Government Owned Contractor Operated teams in theater, and contractor augmentation teams in theater.  The options will be for additional Presets, Resets, and BIT/NET events.  <br><br>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 United States Code 2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a) (2) (iii) (B).  The proposed acquisition of this effort is directly related to the ongoing and future work being performed by the Shadow prime contractor, AAI Corporation, York Road and Industry Lane, Hunt Valley, MD  21030, CAGE CODE 97384.  This requirement must be restricted for the following reasons: 1) AAI Corporation is the only source with the corporate knowledge, expertise, and facilities to execute all basic sustainment requirements for the Shadow TUAS Unmanned Aircraft Systems Program, 2) Many of the components of the Shadow TUAS are proprietary, and the Government does not currently own a Technical Data Package suitable for full and open competition, 3) The technology is state of the art and duplication of the effort would require lengthy development and would impact the Shadow TUAS readiness rate. <br><br>Firms that recognize and can provide the required PBL and Sustainment/Operational Support are encouraged to identify themselves.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement and proposal which shall be considered.  <br>

Simply stated, this construct is engineered to provide the organization with the right people, at the right place, and at the right time. Key to this result is 360-degree multi-rater feedback that would be useful to executive and other Defense acquisition leaders to help these individuals be more effective in their current roles, and also to help them understand the areas they should focus on if they desire to move into other management or leadership roles within Defense acquisition.  <br><br>3.3 DAU relies upon training coordination offices across the DoD to enroll students in courses, including rescheduling when situations occur that requires students to drop after formal enroll-ment.  An initial roster of attendees is available approximately 45 days before the start of a course session.  With few exceptions, the mulit-rater feedback report is required at the start of the class session.<br><br>3.4 Because rescheduling of a few students in each course session occurs between formal en-rollment and the commencement of the course, substitution of one multi-rater subject with an-other has been DAU practice.  If the substitution occurs before the receipt of respondent feed-back to the contractor, the substitution is at no cost to the government.  If the substitution occurs subsequent to receipt of respondent feedback, the contractor will be paid for the multi-rater in-strument whether complete feedback has been received or a report generated.<br><br>4.  OBJECTIVES  <br><br> 	Provide multi-rater (360 degree) assessment tools and reports for executive and other lev-els of Defense acquisition leaders<br> 	Provide a system to solicit, collect, assess and report feedback, as well as the status of so-licitation and collection of feedback<br> 	Provide a performance learning resources and planning tool to enable the individual lead-er development based on the 360 feedback<br> 	As a minimum, the assessment tool will solicit feedback related to leadership competen-cies define by the Office of Personnel Management (22 Executive Core Qualifications and 6 Fundamental Competencies for a total of 28 leadership competencies)<br> 	Training of DAU faculty to facilitate interpretation of assessment reports and develop-mental planning<br> 	Training of DAU administrative staff to access and use the contractors system for the purpose of ordering assessments, receiving reports, and access to other information the contractor intends to provide the government <br><br>5.   SCOPE.  The scope of this effort is to provide DAU the means to collect and interpret lead-ership competency assessments for the purpose of enabling increased capacity and performance of the Defense acquisition workforce.  The support shall include a multi-rater 360-degree indi-vidual assessment instrument (that can be tailored to up to three different surveys), and other needed tools, and performance learning resources and planning materials that will be used for leadership development purposes within the DAU. The subjects using the assessment tool and resource guide environment will be leaders within the defense acquisition community and the DAU. Also, training will be provided to DAU faculty and staff to enable effective interpretation of assessment reports and developmental planning, and interface with the contractor's system.<br><br>6.  REQUIREMENTS<br><br>6.1 Multi-Rater 360-Degree Assessment Tool<br><br>6.1.1 The DAU requires a multi-rater 360-degree assessment tool. The 360-degree assessment tool must be highly reliable and valid, capable of assessing individuals based upon the compe-tencies contained in paragraph 6.1.6. The contractor shall map the competencies contained in the provided tool to the competencies, therein, so that the DAU can assess the Defense acquisition community and the DAU leadership development requirements.  The tool shall be capable of be-ing tailored to customize the name and description of competencies at executive and two addi-tional Defense acquisition management levels.<br><br>6.1.2 Flexibility. The 360-degree assessment shall be flexible, so that leaders and managers in the Defense acquisition community and the DAU can change the name of the competencies, if desired, and provide the capability to add/change/delete competencies to/from the tool environ-ment.<br><br>6.1.3 Demographic Information. The tool shall have the ability to gather demographic infor-mation, the capability to ask open-ended questions and the capability for the subjects and re-spondents to enter comments and have responses reported back to the subject (the individual be-ing assessed).<br><br>6.1.4 Respondents. The tool shall be flexible, with the ability to accommodate different numbers and kinds of respondents that complete the assessment instrument for each subject. For example, if the subject wants only a self-assessment, the subject shall be capable of doing this without changes in the tool environment, or the subject shall also be able to choose just self and peer re-spondents.  The contractor's system must be capable of collecting and aggregating up to five seg-regated groups-the subject, boss/bosses, peers, subordinates, and one other category.<br><br>6.1.5 Level of Importance. The instrument shall be capable of identifying the level of importance of a skill for the subject in their current position and/or the level of skill required for each compe-tency.   As a minimum, the instrument shall be capable of collecting the importance of the skill and/or level of skill required from the subject (self assessment) and the subject's "boss" or "bosses."<br><br>6.1.6 Enterprise License(s) for 360-Degree Assessment. The contractor shall provide any neces-sary enterprise license(s) for the 360-degree assessment tool or system.<br><br>6.1.7 Leadership Competencies Assessed by 360-Degree Assessment Tool.  The primary focus will be the assessment of competencies shown in Figure 1 for executive and two other leadership levels.<br><br>Figure 1.

The survey report shall be flexible. That is, the report shall be customizable so that if the DAU wants to point out competencies that are important for the Defense acquisition commu-nity and DAU subjects to develop, that information can be added or deleted without major changes in the tool or cost to the government. <br><br>6.2.2 The report shall include normative data that show how the subject's scores compared to the population at their same leadership level. <br><br>6.3 Performance Learning Resources and Planning Tool<br><br>6.3.1 Action Planning Tools.

An initial roster of attendees will be provided up to 45 days before the start of a course session.  The multi-rater feedback report is required at the start of the class session.  Because rescheduling of a few students in each course session occurs between formal enrollment and the commencement of the course, substitution of one multi-rater subject with another has been DAU practice.  If the substitution occurs before the receipt of the respondent's feedback to the contract, the substitu-tion is at no cost to the government.  If the substitution occurs subsequent to receipt of the re-spondent's feedback, the contract will be paid for the multi-rater instrument whether complete feedback has been received or a report generated.<br><br>6.5.2 The contractor's system shall offer the capability to produce reports. <br><br>6.5.3 The system shall offer an online capability for subjects to search and identify resources for improvement of competencies assessed by the respective assessment tool. <br><br>6.5.4 The system shall offer an interface resources tool that allows the subject to search for com-petencies and associated resources that she/he would like to pursue in order to further develop their leadership capabilities.<br><br>6.5.5 The contractor shall provide DAU administrators access on demand to retrieve 360-assessment reports.<br><br>6.5.6 The system shall be capable of tracking the delivery of emails to subjects and prospective respondents sufficient to detect the non-delivery of emails.

The contractor shall identify to the Government any potential COIs so that the Government can properly evaluate the COIs in which the outcome will result in avoiding, neutralizing, or mitigating such potential conflicts. FAR Part 9.501 defines "organizational COI" as a situation where because of other relationships or activities a person (company) is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government or cannot objectively perform contract work or has an unfair competi-tive advantage.  FAR 9.502 states that "an organization COI may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on an instant contract, or when the nature of the work to be performed on the instant contract creates an actual or potential COI on a future acquisition."  An "organizational COI" exists when the nature of the work to be performed may, without some re-striction on future activities, (1) result in an unfair competitive advantage to the contractor on other contracts or (2) impair the contractor's objectivity in performing the contract work.  <br>	b. Identification of Non-Disclosure Requirements.  The contractor shall not divulge in-formation considered to be proprietary to the Government or another contractor. If non-disclosure agreements are necessary, they shall be brought to the attention of the Government for signature before the contract is awarded.<br>c. Packaging, Packing and Shipping Instructions.  None. <br>	d. Inspection and Acceptance Criteria. Any items determined to be damaged from pack-aging, packing or shipping from the contractor location and received at the DAU location shall be replaced by the contractor at no additional cost to the Government.<br><br>14.

There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command, Office of Command Counsel, 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401, Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527, Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875. Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command, Office of Command Counsel, Room 2-1SE3401, 1412 Jackson Loop, Ft. Belvoir, VA 22060-5527. The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp. If internet access is not available, contact the contracting officer or HQ, AMC to obtain the AMC-Level Protest Procedures.(End of Clause)<BR><BR>

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to manufacture twenty (20) shim safety rods for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 20MW Nuclear Reactor in accordance with the Specifications, Drawings, and Work Instructions that will be provided by the Government.
<p>The National Institutes of Standards and Technology, Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) owns and operates a 20 MW Test Reactor. This reactor is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) under the name NBSR (National Bureau of Standards) Reactor. The purpose of the NBSR is to be a steady state source of neutron radiation that is being used to perform a variety of radiation experiments under the research programs of the NCNR.</p>
<p>Among the main safety related components of the NBSR are the Shim Safety Rods (SSR's). The function of the SSR's is to regulate and control the nuclear reaction that is taking place in the core of the reactor. The operation part of an SSR is a sheet of the metal cadmium (Cd: a strong neutron absorber) that is captured between two concentric aluminum cylinders, such that no cadmium is in contact with the outside world. These cylinders do not have a circular cross-section. Their cross-section is better described as "oval" or, better yet, as "race track" . The NBSR employs four (4) SSR's simultaneously.</p>
<p>Just like reactor fuel, SSR's are consumables. As they perform their function as control rods, the cadmium in them slowly "burns up" (which means that, during use, the cadmium isotope that performs the control function is slowly replaced by another cadmium isotope that cannot be used to control the reactor). In practice, this means that the SSR's need to be replaced approximately, every four (4) years. The SSR's are replaced in sets of four (4).</p>
<p>The period of performance shall be 18 months from the date of award.</p>
<p>This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business. In accordance with the non-manufacturer rule, the contractor shall be a small business under the applicable size standard and shall provide either its own product or that of another domestic small business manufacturing or processing concern. See FAR 19.102(f) for additional information.</p>
<p>A fixed-price contract is anticipated.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), RFP amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement will be made available via the Internet at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ under RFP number SB1341-12-RP-0032.</p>
<p>THE RFP IS ANTICIPATED FOR RELEASE TO THE VENDOR COMMUNITY ON OR ABOUT MAY 18, 2012 AND WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE VIA THE INTERNET AT THE ABOVE WEB SITE.</p>
<p>POTENTIAL OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCESSING THE WEB SITE.</p>
<p>Interested parties must respond to the RFP in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT AVAILABLE, TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED, AND NO BIDDERS LIST WILL BE MAINTAINED. Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via email to todd.hill@nist.gov.</p>

<CONTACT>Anthony R. Buch, Phone 206-526-6033, Fax 206-527-7752, Email Anthony.R.Buch@noaa.gov
<DESC>NOAA's National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), Alaska Fisheries Science Center, National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has a requirement for technical support of sea lion research in accordance with the Statement of Work.
<p>The work includes, but is not limited to: conducting research on Steller sea lions, a species listed as threatened (eastern stock) and endangered (western stock) under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. These research projects include studies of ecology, physiology, genetics, behavior, and a host of other topics aimed at determining the cause of recent and on-going population declines and ways to enhance recovery. Steller sea lions range across the North Pacific Ocean rim from Japan to central California, thus an important component of our studies includes collection of data on populations outside the United States. This solicitation seeks to continue studies that improve our understanding of Steller sea lion populations in Russia.</p>
<p>The Government is required to meet its responsibilities under the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act, both of which mandate that the Government enhance the recovery of listed species and maintain them at optimal sustainable populations. The NMFS Steller Sea Lion Recovery Plan has, as its goal the cessation of the decline and enhancement of the population to the point where it can be delisted. The 2008 revised draft of the Steller Sea Lion Recovery Plan specifically calls for the need to collect vital rates on Steller sea lions. In addition, the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council has recently expressed a desire that additional work on the population trends of Steller sea lions in Russia be conducted by NMFS in order to assess potential threats to recovery. This work is timely given the fisheries closures enacted by NMFS in 2011 to reduce competition for prey for sea lions in the western Aleutian Islands.</p>
<p>The work requested in this solicitation includes: the collection of information on the abundance of Steller sea lion pups and non-pups on select sites in Russia, branding of Steller sea lion pups, establishing field camps, observations of previously marked sea lions, collection of tissue samples, and blood samples during animal handling, and the collection of fecal samples to provide diet information; and to conduct research on Steller sea lions, a species listed as threatened (eastern stock) and endangered (western stock) under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. These research projects include studies of ecology, physiology, genetics, behavior, and a host of other topics aimed at determining the cause of recent and on-going population declines and ways to enhance recovery. A maximum of 43 known Steller sea lion sites located along approximately 1,160 nautical miles of coast line will be surveyed. The current trend of Steller sea lion abundance in the Commander Islands, the Kuril Islands, East Kamchatka, the western Bering Sea, and the Sea of Okthosk will be estimated and branding and re-sight information added into an existing database. The data collection format will need to be similar to previous surveys in order to have results comparable with previous historical data.</p>
<p>The contractor must also provide an individual(s) capable of supervising and conducting all field work in Russia and in completing manuscripts and reports as listed. The contractor will be required to analyze existing and newly collected data, write annual reports, publish peer-reviewed manuscripts in professional scientific journals, and present this work at U.S. and international scientific meetings.</p>
<p>The contractor must have necessary personnel who are fluent in Russian and English and experienced in surveying and collecting this type of data in the Russian Far East and the ability to obtain the appropriate Russian permits. The NMML does not have the resources or the personnel on staff to conduct this type of work in Russian waters nor are U.S. licensed vessels allowed to work in Russian waters.</p>
<p><strong>This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990 and the size standard is $14.0 million.</strong></p>
<p>All responsible and fully responsive sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. Any resulting contract will be awarded as a firm-fixed-price contract. <strong>Solicitation documents are estimated to be available for download on or around May 3, 2012 at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.</strong> Paper copies of this solicitation will not be issued.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) China Lake, CA intends to procure, on a Firm Fixed Price basis, an Ultra-Fast Laser System.  This procurement is  a full and open competition with a HUBZone price preference.

 The specified ultra-fast laser system will be integrated into the Combustion Diagnostics Laboratory's special test equipment as the excitation/light source for spectroscopic data of combustion events including metallic clouds, various energetic materials and propellants. The laser system is a picoseconds (ps)/femtoseconds (fs) dual timing laser system. The laser is capable of providing laser pulse at the picoseconds and/or femtoseconds pulse length, 2 ps and/or 90fs, respectively, depending on the configuration used during testing.
 The laser system is tunable in the wavelength range from 240 to 2600 nanometers (nm) through an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) rather than the conventional dye laser system. The laser will not be cryogenically cooled due to the high cost of such systems, but will be cooled through a stand-alone, closed loop water chiller. The laser beam at the output of the laser will have a beam profile as close to a Gaussian beam profile as possible to minimize the energy variation across the laser beam.

 Specific information to include detailed specifications shall be included in Solicitation N68936-12-R-0083 to be issued and posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online website at http://www.neco.navy.mil and the FEDBIZOPPS website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about (DATE), to close 30 days after the Request for Proposal issue date.
  
Delivery requirements shall be F.O.B. Destination China Lake, CA.  Estimated award is 11 Sep 2012.
All responsible sources may submit a written quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  All responses shall be submitted in writing to the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Code 210000D, Attn: Joshua Patton, 429 E. Bowen Road Mail Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108.  
All responsible sources must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at the following website: https://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mi;/ccr/scripts/index.html.  In accordance with FAR 4.1201, prospective contractors shall complete electronic annual representations and certifications via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA at: http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the CCR database.

<DESC><p>Introduction</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses, HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your response to this information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under NAICS code 541711 should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as a Metabolomics Standards Synthesis Facility (SF) for the production of candidate metabolomic standards, isotopically-labeled and unlabeled, from key mammalian metabolic pathways including but not limited to such pathways as the glycolytic pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle pathway, sterol, lipid and aminoacid metabolism pathways. The Metabolomics Standard Synthesis Facility is a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund, Metabolomics Program. All Common Fund initiatives invite investigators to develop bold, innovative, and often risky approaches to address problems that may seem intractable or to seize new opportunities that offer the potential for rapid progress.</p>
<p>Metabolomics is the study of low molecular weight molecules or metabolites found within cells and biological systems. It involves technologies, such as mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy which can measure hundreds to thousands of unique chemical entities. The metabolome is a measure of the output of biological pathways and is the most integrated measure of a cell's functional state and thus presents a powerful platform for discerning mechanistic information on different normal and disease states. <br /><br />Despite early promise, challenges remain before the full potential of metabolomics can be realized for translational research. One of the challenges identified was the lack of authentic standards to help in identification, coverage as well as quantitative and qualitative validation of metabolomic findings. The Metabolomics Standards Synthesis Facility (SF) will support the activities of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Program and provide services as a US FDA-defined current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) production facility for candidate metabolomic standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />Project Requirements</p>
<p>The Metabolomics SF shall: 1) participate in the Steering Committee (SC), and subcommittees as necessary, and attend SC meetings and participate in teleconferences, 2) provide, maintain and update a Manual of Procedures (MOP), 3) participate as a member of the Metabolomics Program committees and subcommittees, 4) attend the annual Common Fund Metabolomics Program meetings and participate in monthly teleconferences with the Common Fund Metabolomics Data Repository and Coordinating Center, 5) Develop Material Transfer Agreements (MTA) in collaboration with the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and other components of the Program, for use between the SF and the research investigators' institutions that are part of the Metabolomics Program, 6) Provide services as a US FDA-defined current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) production facility for candidate metabolomic standards. 7) Synthesize to &ge; 95% purity, process, analyze store, and ship products synthesized, 8) Evaluate and report to the COR the feasibility of, and approximate time required to fulfill, each request for synthesis received from the COR, 9) collaborate with the COR and Metabolomics Program to contribute synthesized product data to its electronic databases and web sites. Submit data as defined and called for in the MOP, 10) implement and maintain quality control and quality assurance plans to ensure at least 95% or greater purity for all candidate metabolomic standards requested, 11) have the ability to perform analysis of chemical purity and propose a plan to monitor stability of the standards detailing a recommended method and frequency of analysis, 12) develop analytical protocols to ensure metabolomic standards of uniformly high quality are shipped as requested by the COR, 13) ensure that sufficient quantities of all metabolomic standards synthesized are available to meet the needs of the Metabolomics Program, 14) design and implement monitoring plans for standards including production and compliance with regulatory requirements, 15) maintain and make available for review, as necessary, records of monitoring activities, 16) develop a tracking tool accessible to the COR of all requests and corresponding estimated costs for synthesis and distribution received, 17) participate in site visits to the synthesis facility be conducted by the Metabolomics Program, 18) maintain a laboratory that meets all requirements for the production of research grade and clinical grade reagents, 19) comply with all relevant Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) and Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) regulations, 20) provide complete protocol information, including quality control and quality assurance procedures, in accordance with the MOP to the COR for each synthesized product, 21) establish and implement a plan to work with institutional technical transfer offices to facilitate the completion of material transfer agreements and contracts required to ship materials from one institution to another, and 22) provide the Metabolomics Program with updates to metabolomics standard molecules SF portion of the MOP.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE, pursuant to FAR Part 10 (Market Research) and is not a pre-solicitation notice or solicitation for proposals/quotations.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to release of a formal RFP.

It is anticipated that this work will begin in fiscal year 2012.
  

Background:  As part of the Department of Navy (DON) and the Department of Defenses (DOD) Information Dominance mission, the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) has developed an open source program called bulk_extractor. This program is used in both research and education as a testing and development environment for computer forensics algorithms. The program is also used operationally to assist the DON and DOD in a variety of mission tasks. 

Need: Currently bulk_extractor uses GNU Flex and GNU REGEX for performing regular expression searches. Neither of these programs are Unicode-aware. Since a growing number of subject media contains Unicode, NPS is in need of new code for bulk_extractor that can readily recognize Unicode strings.

NPS is looking for a replacement for GNU Flex and GNU Regex to allow upgrading of bulk_extractors scan_email, scan_acct, and scan_find modules so that all searched strings are automatically searched in all relevant Unicode and legacy encodings.
 NPS is also looking for a replacement for GNU Regex that allows multiple regular expressions to be compiled into a single finite state machine. The resultant code must be freely releasable as open source code so that end-users can freely download the bulk_extractor source code from the Internet, compile and use the program, without having to obtain additional licenses. Users must be able to modify the regular expressions when bulk_extractor is compiled. Users must also be able to provide additional regular expressions when bulk_extractor is run.

The finite state machines produced must run with any kind of arbitrary input and must not crash.

Compile time for bulk_extractor must remain under 3 minutes.

Background: As part of the Department of Navy (DON) and Department of Defenses (DOD) Information Dominance mission, the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) is developing a variety of computer forensic techniques that operate well in a parallel environment. The Hadoop environment, developed by the Apache Foundation, is quickly gaining popularity as a framework for distributed data processing of large data sets in a cluster environment. 

Need: NPS is in need of a contractor that will install and configure on a network on Linux computers operating at its National Capital Region headquarters. Once the system is operational, we need the contractor to work with NPS researchers to adapt our current media exploitation systems (sleuthkit, bulk_extractor, fiwalk) to run in the Hadoop parallel environment.
 Media Exploitation is highly I/O dependent. We are therefore interested in ways of making Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Hadoop MapReduce, and other Hadoop systems change their scheduling so that jobs are moved to the nodes on which the data resides, rather than moving the data to where the jobs are running. We are further looking to develop libraries or modifications to Hadoop so that processes running on Hadoop can gain direct access to computer forensics data, rather than requiring that such accesses go through.

It is anticipated that this work will begin in fiscal year 2012.
  

Background: With the unveiling of Windows Embedded CE 6.0 in November 2006, Microsoft announced the introduction of a new proprietary file system called exFAT. exFAT represents a drastic improvement over the old FAT32 file system, notably in terms of limits total volume size (32GB for FAT32 against 128PB for exFAT), file size (4GB for FAT32 against 16EB for exFAT), or maximum number of files on the volume). While its adoption is still in progress, this new file system is already appreciated for its many advantages over other typically used ones, including NTFS, when used on devices that use flash memory. exFAT is currently available on Windows XP (with patch), Windows Vista SP1, 7 and Windows Server 2008 (SP1 and SP2).
 Mac OS X 10.6.5 also supports exFAT (although there seems to be incompatibility issues between systems formatted on Mac vs. PC). Linux support of exFAT depends on additional software discussed below. As part of the Department of Navy (DON) and Department of Defenses Information Dominance mission, the Naval Postgraduate School is in need of software that can understand the file system structures of Microsofts exFAT file system, as media that implies the 

Need: As part of DON and DODs Information Dominance mission, NPS is developing software that needs to be able to read devices formatted with exFAT. Such support needs to be transparently implemented into The Sleuth Kit, an open source forensic tool kit.
 Support needs to be integrated into SleuthKit and made freely available using similar license terms.  NPS is looking for either an existing exFAT implementation for SleuthKit. Failing that, NPS is interested in contracting the development of exFAT, such contracting to include the development of an implementation, the development of test data to test the implementation, the development of a regression test, and the integration of all resulting software into the current SleuthKit framework.

NPS is seeking software that is delivered as Free Open Source Software (FOSS) with either no copyright license (public domain), or software that is licensed under the GPL, LPGL, BSD 3-Clause, or a license approved by the Open Source Initiative.

Background: As part of the Department of Navy and Department of Defenses Information Dominance mission, and to support in the analysis of computer media that are obtained during the course of law enforcement and defense operations, the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) frequently encounters computer media that contain fragments of digital video files that have been partially overwritten. Such files cannot be processed by normal computer video players.

Need: NPS is in need of software that can find fragments of digital video files in a variety of formats and encapsulate the video into playable video files. In particular, software is needed that can recognize video in the FLV and MPEG formats.
 The software must further be able to extract all existing metadata from the video and store that metadata in a form that can be readily processed by other tools. Existing solutions, such as NFI Defraser (http://sourceforge.net/projects/defraser/), have software dependencies that make them unusable in many environments. (Defraser in particular is based on the Microsoft Windows Media DLLs and as such cannot run on non-Windows operating systems). 

NPS is seeking software that is delivered as Free Open Source Software (FOSS) with either no copyright license (public domain), or software that is licensed under the GPL, LPGL, BSD 3-Clause, or a license approved by the Open Source Initiative. Software that results from this project may be embedded into the NPS bulk_extractor program.

<DESC>PURPOSE:
The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) on behalf of PMS 320 (the Navys Electric Ships Office), seeking information on large-scale electrical energy storage modules (ESM) for use in Navy platforms that may be procured under a small business set-aside, competitive contract. This RFI is for planning purposes, as part of market research led by PMS 320 to identify potential sources to produce energy storage modules to meet electrical load requirements onboard US Navy ships. A decision will be made at a later date as to whether or not to issue the solicitation as a competitive set aside for U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a), HUB Zone Small Business (HUB Zone), Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and/or Small Business (SB) sources or whether to issue as full and open competition (unrestricted).

DESCRIPTION:
This request is to gain knowledge of the industry base and the current and projected state of the art for energy storage modules.
  These energy storage modules would apply to what a ship may need to enable operation of the electric plant on a single ship service gas turbine-generator set, mitigating the need for additional gas turbines to be running in operating reserve in case of a loss of power from the single operating gas turbine. 

A number of alternative energy storage media technologies and/or configurations (location within the electrical distribution system) and capacity may be considered for future ship applications, such as battery, capacitor, or fly wheel. Shipboard power quality and continuity is critical. Energy storage modules should provide up to approximately 2.5 megawatts (MW) of standby power for the 450 Volt AC shipboard power system.
 It is envisioned that the energy storage module itself would be modular, providing some internal redundancy, and connected to the switchboard and/or load center level maintaining power for a period of at least three minutes. Since the energy storage module may be back fitted on US Navy ships, the system will need to be distributed based on geometric space, available electrical connections, and availability of required auxiliary services. 

Responses should address both the technology and manufacturing readiness levels (TRLs / MRLs) for the energy storage media and for the power electronics required to interface and control the stored energy with the shipboard power system, addressing the media or the electronics alone is not sufficient.
 Responses should address the manufacturing and production capability of the firm, and provide the government with enough information to assess the vendors ability to fabricate up to four 2.5MW energy storage systems per year. Production numbers of relevant components and overall production capability are also desired. If the described storage media are not yet in production, the response should indicate when the technology and manufacturing capability would be expected to be ready. The specific design issues to be considered include reliability, volumetric and gravimetric power and energy densities, differentiating between high power density and high energy density. The relevant information required for characterizing technology performance include: production capability (number of cells produced per year, kWh/MWH per year); TRL of components and systems; safety evaluation and qualifications performed on relevant subsystems or components (any hazard analyses of systems designs as relevant to notional applications); other military application of the devices; energy storage management system approach; thermal characteristics, constraints, and cooling requirements; auxiliary requirements (load); device impedance (heat generation characteristics); and device efficiency discharge/recharge).

RESPONSES:
Responses should indicate enough detail so that potential Navy interest can be assessed.
 Information should be e-mailed to Mr. Adam Goldberg at adam.goldberg@navy.mil or mailed to Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Mr. Adam Goldberg, PMS320, 1333 Isaac Hull Avenue SE, Washington Navy Yard, D.C. 20376 and labeled with the solicitation number and Energy Storage Module Sources Sought.

Responses are requested by 10:00 am (EST), on May 14, 2012.

Responses are requested to be provided electronically and acceptable formats include Adobe PDF, Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint files. Questions can be submitted electronically to adam.goldberg@navy.mil. Information provided shall be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider.
 This RFI in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies. The information provided will assist NAVSEA in developing and further defining future procurement and acquisition strategies. Defense and commercial contractors that are not small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and/or woman-owned small businesses should not respond to this announcement. This RFI is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government. NAVSEA may request further information regarding the capabilities of respondents to meet the requirements and may request a presentation and/or a site visit as deemed necessary.

Three-tier architecture has the following tiers:Presentation tierThis is the topmost level of the application and, in the case of StarLIMS, is contained in a compiled executable distributed by StarLIMS when any licenses are purchased. The presentation tier displays information that needs to be accessed by laboratory users. It communicates with other tiers by outputting results to the graphical user interface or passing information to the relation database management system (RDBMS). When developed by a software vendor, this tier and its associated source code is owned and maintained by the vendor. The NWQL does not have any access to the source code.
Application tier - otherwise known as the business logic, logic tier, data access tier, or middle tierThe logic tier is pulled out from the presentation tier and, as its own layer; it controls an applications functionality by performing detailed processing. This is the tier within StarLIMS that contains all of the custom functionality developed by the NWQL programmers and this now differs significantly from the middle tier that StarLIMS now delivers with StarLIMS 10 version of its software. 
Data tierThis tier consists of database servers. Here information is stored and retrieved. This tier keeps data neutral and independent from application servers or business logic. Giving data its own tier also improves scalability and performance. However, both the presentation tier and the application tier must be designed to interact with the data tier. There are date and tables located within the data tier that are only accessed by the presentation tier and if those tables are not upgraded when the presentation tier is upgraded or if they are modified without maintaining the correct relationship with the presentation tier then the presentation layer will fail and the software will not function properly.
StarLIMS is unique for this procurement because only StarLIMS has the source code for the presentation tier, which is the base tier used to display the application to the user. Any changes made to the presentation tier by StarLIMS could affect both the application tier and the data tier because the table structure and queries used by the presentation layer are unknown to anyone outside of StarLIMS. Therefore, the design, development, maintenance, and support of the software, especially the software used by the presentation tier, remains solely with StarLIMS Corporation. In addition, update rights to new versions can only be given by StarLIMS. 
Based on the information at this time, the government considers the services specified as a sole source from StarLIMS Corporation and proposes to negotiate a contract with the firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services or its functional equivalent (based on the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit, in writing, an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and other such materials which correspond to the required services stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  Affirmative response shall be received by this office by close of business May 4, 2012 by 3:00 P.M. Mountain Standard Time.  This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this procurement.

<a href="mailto:ryan.j.bayless@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Sacramento</a>
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for a Market Research ONLY to determine the availability of small business firms for a potential small business category type set-aside.  NO AWARD will be made from this Sources Sought.  NO SOLICITATION, SPECIFICATIONS, OR DRAWINGS IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME; therefore, do NOT request a copy of a solicitation.  Potential offerors having the skill, capabilities and bonding necessary to perform the described project are invited to provide feedback via email to Mr. Bayless at Ryan.J.Bayless@usace.army.mil.  All responses will be used to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for a potential future acquisition. <br><br>Particularly, the purpose of this NOTICE is to gain knowledge of potential small business sources to include small business in the following categories: Small Business, Certified 8a, Certified HUB Zone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), for the Military Ocean Terminal Concord (MOTCO) Holding Pads Expansion Effort.  The capabilities will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining to Set-Aside for the Small Business Community or to conduct as an Other Than Small Business Procurement.  Other than small businesses may respond to this NOTICE in the event the market does not indicate SB interest, however, preference will be given to the SB categories listed above.  The government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of available contractors.<br><br>This project is planned for advertising in May 2012.  The estimated cost range according to the DFARS 36.204 is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The NAICS Code is 237310, the size standard is $33.5 million, and the Federal Supply Code is Z2LB, Repair or Alteration of Highways, roads, streets, bridges, and railways.  The duration of the project is 485 calendar days.<br><br>Under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) guidelines 52.219-14, the concern will perform at least 15% of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees.<br><br>PROJECT DESCRIPTION<br><br>Description of Work:  The installation (previously known as the Concord Naval Weapons Station) is now known as Military Ocean Terminal Concord (MOTCO), which the Department of the Army has taken possession from the Department of the Navy several years ago.  The Holding Pads were originally constructed (for the Department of Navy missions) in 1997 and are paved with asphalt concrete (AC).<br><br>The current customer desires to expand the footprints of both the access driveways (to and from) and the holding pads.  There are currently eight separate holding pads (approximately 85 feet by 200 feet) with access driveways (approximately 15 feet in width).  The holding pads are planned to be widened (approximately 15 to 20 feet) along their long side for improved stacker lift maneuvering room and performance while the access driveways will be widened to two lanes in width.  The customer requires that the pavement section for both the holding pads and access driveways be designed to support the loads of the "Terex 45 Super Stacker Vehicle" and the containers that are to be stacked on the pad.  <br><br>The Terex (model TFC 45) Stacker Vehicle load is 67.6 tons (unloaded).  The Terex 45 transports one box container at a time.  The design container box weight is 20,000 lbs.  A mission cycle consists of transporting/stacking 72 loaded box containers on the holding pad.  <br><br>The basic approach to the construction will be to provide excavation to the existing embankment (to widen both the pads and the access driveways).  The existing storm drainage culverts will have to be lengthened and existing fire hydrants relocated (due to the widening).  As a result of heavy loading, a sub-base course of 18 inches (in thickness) and a base course layer of 18 inches may be required.  The asphalt pavement will be placed in lifts for a total depth of 8 to 10 inches utilizing a 75-blow Marshall mix (to withstand the higher tire pressures).  The container holding pads will require an additional 2 inch overlay of "Resin Modified" pavement.  To accommodate the expansion, the existing chain link gates (leading into and out of the holding pads) will need to be resized and installed.<br><br>CAPABILITY STATEMENT<br><br>The following requests are designed to apprise the US Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District, of any prospective construction contractors' project execution capabilities.  Please provide your response to the following.  The submission is limited to 10 pages.<br><br>1) Offeror's name, address, DUNS number, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address.<br><br>2) Offeror's interest in bidding on the solicitation when it is issued.<br><br>3) Offeror's capability to perform a contract of this magnitude and complexity and comparable work performed within the past 5 years - Describe your self performed effort, brief description of the project, customer name, timeliness of performance, customer satisfaction, and dollar value of the project) - provide at least 3 examples showing verifiable evidence of experience of performing repairs/renovations to water distribution systems (i.e. fire hydrants) without interrupting/affecting existing distribution system fireflow or distribution system pressures.<br><br>4) Offeror's type of small business and Business Size (Small Business, HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned and/or Small Business, 8(a))<br><br>5) Offeror's Joint Venture information if applicable - existing and potential<br><br>6) Offeror's Bonding Capability in the form of a letter from Surety <br><br>The Capabilities Statement for this sources sought is not expected to be a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach, but rather short statements regarding the company's ability to demonstrate existing-or-developed expertise and experience in relation to the areas specified herein.

<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, "Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes" This Sources Sought Notice is for information and planning purposes only at this time and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

REQUIREMENT:   

The Department of Veterans Affairs National Energy Business Center, Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) is seeking to fulfill the mandated federal agency energy management requirements of increasing renewable energy consumption as stated in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005), Executive Order (EO) 13423, "Strengthening Federal Environmental, Energy and Transportation Management," and EO 13514, "Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy, and Economic Performance."  In concert with these requirements, we are seeking potential sources for the Feasibility Study of an Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage System (ATES) at the Chillicothe VA Medical Center, Chillicothe, Ohio and the Dayton VA Medical Center, Dayton, Ohio. 

Facility	Address
Chillicothe VA Medical Center	17273 State Route 104
Chillicothe, OH 45601
Dayton VA Medical Center	4100 W. 3rd Street
Dayton, OH 45428

The Department of Veterans Affairs National Energy Business Center (VA-NEBC) Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement.

The contractor shall furnish all materials and labor to provide an in-depth Feasibility Study (FS) of ATES systems at the VA Medical Centers in Chillicothe and Dayton, Ohio.  This FS will recommend system locations, and quantify potential energy conservation and cost saving opportunities. 

Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) requires a suitable aquifer, into which at least two thermal wells are installed.  Other components of an ATES system include heat exchangers, conveyance piping, and mechanical systems and controls necessary to integrate an ATES system with a heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) system.   

ATES systems typically involve storage and recovery of cold water, although warm water storage is also used, particularly if there is excess heat available in summer months from solar panels or a cogeneration plant.  During cold winter weather, groundwater can be pumped through a simple heat exchanger where it is chilled, and stored in a designated cold store portion of an aquifer.  Cold groundwater is recovered from the cold store during summer months and used for cooling.  After the water has been used for cooling, it has been warmed and is injected into the designated warm store portion of the aquifer.  The cycle is repeated seasonally.

The contractor will obtain and review available site and energy data and perform a fatal-flaw analysis of the practicable feasibility of ATES at the site, as well as a preliminary economic evaluation and survey of potential incentives and funding mechanisms. 

The possibility of storing cold water in the winter months, and using it in the summer, and storing hot water in summer, and using it during winter, shall be evaluated.  If both summer and winter storage is not possible, then present supporting justification, and evaluate only the feasible storage.

Considering site conditions, existing and proposed system components, and operations & maintenance (O&M) costs, conduct a financial analysis for system installation. 

Other FS tasks shall include (but not be limited to):
 
1.	Perform site visit and meet with VA facility representatives to evaluate the existing cooling systems, identify physical and operational constraints at the site that will affect the location of ATES system components, and to evaluate the potential to use existing equipment (e.g., heat exchangers and wells).

2.	Compile and review available hydro-geological and geo-chemical data from the following sources:

a.	Site facilities staff;
b.	Local well drillers;
c.	Municipal sources;
d.	State sources; and
e.	Federal sources including United States Geological Survey.

This data will be used to develop an understanding of the expected well flow rates, aquifer geometric and hydraulic properties, and aquifer geochemistry.  NOTE:  Test well drilling is not included in this scope of work.  

3.	Contact local, state and municipal representatives to review permitting constraints and outline the process of obtaining the necessary approvals to install and operate an ATES system.

4.	Develop a conceptual engineering design.  Provide a schematic design to be used for the basis of a design-build contracting effort.  Develop the recommended technical description for the system to be procured for each site.  To the extent possible, develop standard language that, with minor modifications to make it specific to each site, can be used across VA for all ATES procurements of the same type.  The intent is this language will become an integral component of the submitted reports released to solicit proposals for designing and installing ATES systems of particular types at specific VA sites.  

5.	An estimate of the incremental cost and incremental energy savings will be analyzed and a life cycle cost determined based on financial parameters.

6.	Identify sources of grants and other funding mechanisms that may be available to offset the cost of the ATES system.   

Prepare a Phase I Feasibility Study Report to document the results and findings.  The report will include an estimated thermal load that could be met by an ATES system, a financial evaluation, along with recommendations for Phase II activities, as appropriate.

Because this is a Sources Sought announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.  No solicitation exists. Therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.

The Government reserves the right to consider a small business, SDVOSB, VOSB or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto so it is in the interest of small businesses to respond to this notice if they feel that they are capable of meeting the requirements of this project.

<DESC>NOTICE OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION (NOPCA): The Cryptologic Systems Division (CPSD) Contracting Branch, HNCKA, Lackland AFB, San Antonio, TX, intends to award on a sole source basis a firm-fixed-price contract for procurement of MYK5/12 Tester Boards, 4 each. The MYK5/12 Tester Boards are required to meet lifecycle sustainment for the next 20 years. The tester boards were developed by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), SafeNet Government Solutions, LLC, 359 Van Ness Way, Torrance, CA 90501, CAGE CODE: 6S598, as a propriety product and received National Security Agency (NSA) certification as a Type-1 CRYPTO unit under the NSA Commercial COMSEC Endorsement Program (CCEP). The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one (1) responsible source. The Air Force's lack of complete specifications, schematics/drawings and parts precludes the use of Full and Open Competition procedures to satisfy this requirement. SafeNet is the only vendor known to the Air Force capable providing these tester boards, because as the OEM it has the required software to make the circuit board work to test MYK-5/12 ground units, to include the engineering knowledge, expertise, and complete drawing package related to the MYK5/12 ground units. An ESD Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerrors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting the Ombudsman, concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer for consideration. IAW AFFARS 5352.201-9101, the ability to contact an Ombudsman, will be included in this acquisition's solicitation and contract. The ESC Ombudsman can be contacted at: ESC Ombudsman, Bldg 1606, 9 Eglin Street, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731, Telephone 781-377-5106, Facsimile 781-377-4659, Email: ESC.Ombudsman@hanscom.af.mil. If a firm believes it is capable of meeting the Government's requirement, it may identify their interest and capability to the Contracting Officer, Ralph Urias, 210-977-4913, ralph.urias@us.af.mil within fifteen (15) days of this publication. Those interested firms must indicate whether they are a large, small, and small-disadvantaged, 8(a), or women owned business and whether they are U.S. or foreign owned.

EOM Offshore is the only known manufacturer that can provide an elastic mooring hose that meets the Government's requirements. This is a bungee-like cord with electrical wires coiled inside designed to moor meteorological buoys and allow information and power to be transferred from the top of the buoy to instruments down below. The reinforced rubber stretch hose was developed for mooring systems that require a stable platform for sensors or acoustics. It can stretch to two and half times its original length and services as a highly effective and robust mechanical isolator between the surface buoy and the quiet low mooring section. The hose construction makes use of elastomer-synthetic composite technology for elasticity and strength and also has eight numbers 22 electrical conductors built into it to allow signals and power to be transmitted along its length. A sources sought notice was posted on FedBizOpps under NRMAF0001201893KLC on April 3, 2012 for a 10-day posting that resulted in no responses to the notice.

<SOLNBR>G12PS00320
<CONTACT>Kenneth Moris

<a href="mailto:kmoris@usgs.gov">kmoris@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for annual membership to the Consortium of Organizations for Strong-Motion Observation Systems (COSMOS).  The COSMOS membership will provide the Earthquake Hazards Program (EHP) of the USGS with partnership access to dense networks of observations of ground motion in urban areas, monitoring for seismic hazards at a level of detail far exceeding that which can be provided by federal funding representing a tangible and of significant benefit to further the EHP's Congressional mandate to develop, disseminate, and promote knowledge, tools, and practices for earthquake risk reduction.
The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above.  Therefore, it intends to make an award to COSMOS, unless it is contacted by any vendor who believes they can provide the required Consortium of Organizations for Strong-Motion Observation Systems membership.  Vendors are invited to contact the Contracting Specialist, kmoris@usgs.gov no later than 12:00 PM EST, Monday, April 23, 2012 with an affirmative answer.   
SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION STATES THE FOLLOWING PART:
The following information is provided to demonstrate the proposed contractor's unique qualifications:
 COSMOS is a unique organization within the strong-motion and earthquake safety communities. While many organizations gather, process, and catalog strong-motion data, COSMOS is the only organization that develops standards for these activities. Its products are therefore of great importance to the EHP as they provide a thorough and informed consensus process for the required standards and the resultant near real-time data. COSMOS's consortium structure results in a powerful set of standards and represents high-level and high-quality cooperation for the acquisition, processing, dissemination, and application of earthquake strong-motion data. The Strong-Motion Standards and Guidelines developed by COSMOS in the past are available through the COSMOS website at http://www.cosmos-eq.org/publications/index.html. 
Dues will provide for support of services to establish consensus standards for strong-motion data formats and data utilization and distribution standards in support of the EHP's Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) and National Strong-Motion Program (NSMP) objectives. 
Standards will be established based on national consensus and multi-agency efforts so that the needs of both the practicing engineering and research scientific communities are met. The standards will account for new capabilities of real-time modern digital instrumentation as well as conventional analog and digital instrumentation with only on-site recording capabilities. Standards will be developed to significantly improve the format to acquire and analyze strong-motion data via the Internet for purposes of site-specific earthquake resistant design and scientific research in support of EHP objectives. These standards are vital to the evaluation of seismic data to meet ANSS's Congressional mandate of monitoring and warning.
The high-quality access to data that COSMOS membership affords the EHP provides risk-reduction information that will be (and has been in the past) utilized by the scientific, engineering, and emergency response communities to reduce the economic and life-safety impacts of earthquakes on the U.S. 
If COSMOS membership is not procured, the impact to the EHP is that data collection and processing guidelines within the U.S. will not remain up-to-date and will thereby not be useful for the important delivery of near real-time information to guide emergency response and provide much-needed information on earthquake ground motions and the response of buildings to strong shaking and will not be available to be used to mitigate seismically induced risks. 
.Additional essential hazard identification and risk analysis actions that the EHP will have access to as a result of COSMOS membership will include, but not be limited to: 
- Joint development of policies and fostering of innovative ideas by COSMOS members for the universal improvement in strong-motion measurements and their applications; - Joint promotion of the advancement of strong-motion measurement by COSMOS and the EHP in densely urbanized areas and other locations of special significance to populations likely to be struck by future earthquakes;	 - Joint encouragement of the rapid, convenient, and effective distribution of strong-motion data according to COSMOS-developed standards;	 - Joint improvement, expansion, and support by COSMOS of strong-motion programs; Participate in the consortium through which programs and institutions solve issues of mutual concern regarding instrumentation, data quality, data dissemination, and data utilization;	 - Jointly advance systematic user influence on data acquisition and data dissemination processes; and 	- Jointly advance and facilitate the use of strong-motion data to achieve improved earthquake resistance of the built environment. 
This membership provides the tangible benefits as noted above, needed to further the objectives of the EHP and its elements, ANSS and NSMP.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. GAO anticipates awarding a fixed price contract.  This combined synopsis/solicitation is organized into eight parts: (1) Requirements; (2) Applicability of FAR Provisions; (3) Proposals; (4) Technical Evaluation and Award; (5) Late Clause; (6) Point of Contact; (7) Attachment: A- Drug Data List. (8) Clauses


Background 
Certain drugs, such as chemotherapy drugs, administered primarily in a physicians office, hospital outpatient clinic, or other outpatient setting, are covered through Medicare Part B.  Nearly one-third of these drugs are for the treatment of cancer or its side effects.  Others are for the treatment of end-stage renal disease, asthma, Crohns disease, and additional diseases and conditions.  Several are vaccines.

Congress has asked GAO to study the Part B drugs and, for each of the 55 drugs, estimate the proportion of calendar year 2010 national expenditures and utilization that is associated with Medicare beneficiaries.    

Objectives
The contractor shall provide GAO with a calendar year 2010 national expenditure and utilization estimate for each of the 55 drugs listed on Attachment A.  The estimates will be included in the GAO report described above and will be used as a denominator to estimate the proportion of national expenditures and utilization associated with Medicare beneficiaries.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services..<br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor.

The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4)The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) Work Orders.

Item 0001 below is being requested as &lsquo;items unique to the manufacturer' no substitutions will be accepted. This kit is in support of the USMC Combat Camera. The USMC Combat Camera is unique in the Department of Defense in the way it organizes, trains and equips its Marines in the field, training commands and base and stations. A DOTMLPF working group was established in 2000 and one of the first charters was to standardize all Table of Equipment (T/E) that all Marines use as acquisition and production gear. It was determined that it must be of the same brand name model and make and capabilities to ensure that no additional training is required as most if not all personnel are required to deploy on short notice within 30 days upon reporting to their new duty stations. This same equipment is currently being fielded to their Fleet units and this order will fully field the units required for entry level training at the Defense Information School (DINFOS) where prior coordination has already been finalized.

<p>As prescribed in 225.1101(2)(i), use the following clause:</p>
<p>BUY AMERICAN ACT AND BALANCE OF PAYMENTS PROGRAM (JAN 2009)</p>
<p>(a) <em>Definitions. </em>As used in this clause&#63719;</p>
<p>(1) "Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item"-</p>
<p>(i) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is-</p>
<p>(A) A commercial item (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of "commercial item" in section 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation);</p>
<p>(B) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and</p>
<p>(C) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and</p>
<p>(ii) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in section 3 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 40102), such as agricultural products and petroleum products.</p>
<p>(2) "Component" means an article, material, or supply incorporated directly into an end product.</p>
<p>(3) "Domestic end product" means-</p>
<p>(i) An unmanufactured end product that has been mined or produced in the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) An end product manufactured in the United States if-</p>
<p>(A) The cost of its qualifying country components and its components that are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. The cost of components includes transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end product and U.S. duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued). Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for processing in the United States is considered domestic. A component is considered to have been mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States (regardless of its source in fact) if the end product in which it is incorporated is manufactured in the United States and the component is of a class or kind for which the Government has determined that-</p>
<p><em>(1)</em> Sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States; or</p>
<p><em>(2)</em> It is inconsistent with the public interest to apply the restrictions of the Buy American Act; or</p>
<p>(B) The end product is a COTS item.</p>
<p>(4) "End product" means those articles, materials, and supplies to be acquired under this contract for public use.</p>
<p>(5) "Foreign end product" means an end product other than a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(6) "Qualifying country" means any country set forth in subsection 225.872-1 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).</p>
<p>(7) "Qualifying country component" means a component mined, produced, or manufactured in a qualifying country.</p>
<p>(8) "Qualifying country end product" means-</p>
<p>(i) An unmanufactured end product mined or produced in a qualifying country; or</p>
<p>(ii) An end product manufactured in a qualifying country if the cost of the following types of components exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components:</p>
<p>(A) Components mined, produced, or manufactured in a qualifying country.</p>
<p>(B) Components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.</p>
<p>(C) Components of foreign origin of a class or kind for which the Government has determined that sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.</p>
<p>(9) "United States" means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas.</p>
<p>(b) This clause implements the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. Section 10a-d). In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, the component test of the Buy American Act is waived for an end product that is a COTS item (see section 12.505(a)(1) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation). Unless otherwise specified, this clause applies to all line items in the contract.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall deliver only domestic end products unless, in its offer, it specified delivery of other end products in the Buy American Act&#63719;Balance of Payments Program Certificate provision of the solicitation. If the Contractor certified in its offer that it will deliver a qualifying country end product, the Contractor shall deliver a qualifying country end product or, at the Contractor's option, a domestic end product.</p>
<p>(d) The contract price does not include duty for end products or components for which the Contractor will claim duty-free entry.</p>

Contractor personnel are required to wear or prominently display installation identification badges or contractor-furnished, contractor identification badges while visiting or performing work on the installation.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall submit a written request on company letterhead to the contracting officer listing the following: contract number, location of work site, start and stop dates, and names of employees and subcontractor employees needing access to the base. The letter will also specify the individual(s) authorized to sign for a request for base identification credentials or vehicle passes.

<p>(c) During performance of the contract, the contractor shall be responsible for obtaining required identification for newly assigned personnel and for prompt return of credentials and vehicle passes for any employee who no longer requires access to the work site.</p>

This information is routinely used by DPG Law Enforcement and Security personnel to conduct drivers license and criminal history / background checks.Adverse information revealed by such checks (e.g., outstanding criminal warrants, criminal history indicating a potential risk to DPG Installation security, or similar negative information indicating a potential security and/or Law Enforcement risk to DPG), may result in a denial of access and/or reentry to U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground.Delays caused by any adverse employee information do not constitute a basis for claim by the Contractor.

To the extent that ODS requirements were revealed by this review, they are identified in Section C or the statement of work of this document.(c)	If offerors possess any special knowledge about any other ODS required directly or indirectly at any level of contract performance, the U.S. Army would appreciated if such information was surfaced to the Contracting Officer for appropriate action.  To preclude delay to the procurement, offerors should provide any information as soon as possible after release of the solicitation and prior to the submission of offers to the extent practicable.  It should be understood that there is no obligation on offerors to comply with this request and that no compensation can be provided for doing so.<BR><BR>Manufacturer or supplier must ensure that all OSHA standards applicable to that which is being purchased are complied with.<BR><BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.

The HQ, AMC-Level Protest program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolutions forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<DESC>Solicitation No. 7FCM-C4-03-0073-B
Schedule 73 Food Service, Hospitality, Cleaning Equipment and Supplies, Chemicals, and Services

Synopsis:

Notice:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated. 
 
GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs.

GSA MULTIPLE AWARD SCHEDULE (MAS) SOLICITATION The Greater Southwest Acquisition Center, Fort Worth, TX, is issuing a refreshed solicitation for the Core Business Line (CBL) for Schedule 073, Food Service, Hospitality, Cleaning Equipment and Supplies, Chemicals, and Services.

Executive Order 13514 (http://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13514/) requires that 95% of all new contract actions are designated for products and/or services through certification guidelines established by governmental agencies.  In order to begin implementation of that order, GSA has designated these two SINs on Schedule 73, which will require qualifications.  For SIN 302-49, all items, where applicable, must meet Energy Star or Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) requirements (where applicable), and be qualified Energy Star or FEMP compliant.

Energy Star is a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy helping us all save money and protect the environment through energy efficient products and practices.   For SIN 375-361 all items must be certified as Biopreferred by obtaining certification from the U. S. Department of Agriculture at www.biopreferred.gov.  The solicitation will remain in effect until it is replaced by a refreshed solicitation. The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous; contract periods commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years from the DOA unless further extended pursuant to option clause, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen), which allows the Government to extend the contract three additional five-year periods, not to exceed a total of twenty years.

<p>The mission of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is to administer the provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act), the Miner Act of 2006 and to enforce compliance with mandatory safety and health standards as a means to eliminate fatal accidents; to reduce the frequency and severity of nonfatal accidents; to minimize health hazards; and to promote improved safety and health conditions in the Nation's mines.</p>
<p>Technical Support, a program area within MSHA, provides engineering and scientific expertise to assist MSHA, the states, and mining industry in the resolution of safety and health issues. It conducts field investigations, laboratory studies, and analyses to resolve specific problems. Equipment and materials used in mines are also evaluated and approved by the Directorate. Mine emergency response capability, including on-site analysis and decision-making assistance for crisis management are also maintained. Technical Support&lsquo;s engineers provide expertise in critical training disciplines for MSHA enforcement. Technical Support manages DOL's Dam Safety Program and is responsible for planning, coordinating, directing activities at the national and field levels to assist enforcement in carrying out mandates of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.</p>
<p>The Development of Risk and Readiness Assessment Models for MSHA and Industry is required based on a need identified by a Holistic Gap Analysis performed by MSHA and agency experience relative to mine emergency preparedness and response. There are currently no parallel efforts or prior contracts in process at MSHA along this line of work. To the best of our knowledge, there is no similar work currently being performed in other agencies dealing with these topics. A Risk Assessment model for Industry, formerly funded by NIOSH, has been found to be too cumbersome to apply. A simpler model is required in order to be useful by MSHA and industry on a daily basis. Assessment models of mine rescue teams, responsible persons, and government/industry do not exist at this time.</p>
<p><br />1.1 OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>The objectives of this effort are to:</p>
<p>1. Develop a risk assessment model and methodology for mine operators to use to prevent major mine emergencies;<br />2. Develop a model and methodology for assessment of preparedness of mines for emergency response;<br />3. Develop a model and methodology to assess the readiness of mine rescue teams;<br />4. Develop a model to assess the readiness of responsible persons at active mining operations to respond to mine emergencies;<br />5. Develop a model and methodology to assess the readiness of government and industry to respond to mine emergencies.</p>
<p>1.2 SCOPE<br />Broadly, this work will evolve theoretical concepts for risk and readiness assessment into simplified models and tools that can applied by MSHA and industry for use at operational levels.</p>
<p>1.3 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The period of performance is not to exceed one year from the date of award for a period of 12months.</p>

<p>PHASE 1 (Task 1.1 through Task 1.5)</p>
<p>Task 1.1 Development of a Risk Assessment Model and Methodology for Mines</p>
<p>The application of risk assessment and management is critical for U.S. underground coal mines, aimed at preventing major hazardous conditions from coming together and causing emergency events.</p>
<p>During this task, the contractor will develop a Mine Risk Assessment Model which can be implemented by coal mine operators to identify risks at their operations and methods for them to eliminate or control such risks in a systematic manner. The resulting model and associated tools should be relatively easy to apply at diverse mining operations and produce quantitatively measurable improvements relative to mine safety.</p>
<p>Deliverables Task 1.1:</p>
<p>1. Monthly Status Reports <br />2. Risk Assessment Model, Methodology, and Tools Final Report</p>
<p><br />Task 1.2 Development of a Preparedness Assessment Model and Methodology for Mine Emergency Response</p>
<p>The ability to assess the preparedness of an underground coal mine operation to respond to mine emergencies is critical for emergency response. Without knowing what capabilities exist, and which critical capabilities may be missing, leaves an operation vulnerable and unable to respond appropriately when required.</p>
<p>During this task, the contractor will develop a model to assess the preparedness of individual mines for emergency response. The resulting model and associated tools should be relatively easy to train personnel to use and implement.</p>
<p>Deliverables Task 1.2:</p>
<p>1. Monthly Status Reports <br />2. Preparedness Assessment Model, Methodology, and Tools Final Report</p>
<p><br />Task 1.3 Development of a Readiness Assessment Model and Methodology for Mine Rescue Teams</p>
<p>The ability to assess the readiness and competency of mine rescue teams is critical to the success of any mine emergency/recovery operation. Mine rescue teams must have the proper equipment, training, knowledge, and abilities to perform competently.</p>
<p>During this task, the contractor will develop a model to assess the readiness of mine rescue teams for use during mine emergency operations. The resulting model and associated tools should be relatively easy to train personnel to use and implement.</p>
<p>Deliverables Task 1.3:</p>
<p>1. Monthly Status Reports <br />2. Readiness Assessment Model, Methodology, and Tools Final Report</p>
<p><br />Task 1.4 Development of a Readiness Assessment Model and Methodology for Responsible Persons</p>
<p>The ability to assess the readiness and competency of responsible persons is critical to the success of any evacuation and mine emergency/recovery operation. Responsible persons must have the proper equipment, training, knowledge, and abilities to perform competently.</p>
<p>During this task, the contractor will develop a model to assess the readiness of responsible persons for responding to mine emergency operations. The resulting model and associated tools should be relatively easy to train personnel to use and implement.</p>

<p>PART 6<br />APPLICABLE PUBLICATIONS</p>
<p><br />REFERENCES, LAWS, REGULATIONS AND POLICIES</p>
<p>At a minimum, Contractor performance in accordance with the requirements herein shall fully comply with the following laws, regulations, policies and guidelines:</p>
<p>&bull; Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002 - Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)<br />&bull; The Privacy Act of 1974, PL 93-579, as amended<br />&bull; OMB Circular A-123 Revised, Management's Responsibility for Internal Control, December 2004<br />&bull; OMB Circular A-127, Financial Management Systems, July 23, 1993<br />&bull; OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources<br />&bull; Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12, Policies for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors<br />&bull; Department of Labor, Computer Security Handbook (CSH)</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement:<br />- 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial (FEB 2012)<br />- 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) applies to this acquisition, with the following addendum to paragraph a:<br /><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>A. Technical Capability<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Experience<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Understanding of the Requirement<br />B. Past Performance<br />C. Price</p>
<p>The non-Price factors combined are significantly more important than Factor C, Price. However, price will become significantly more important as non-price factors approach equality. Offerors are cautioned that the award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical features than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior technical features. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor A, and its associated sub-factors. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br /><br />The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule.</p>
<p>Sub-factor 1: EXPERIENCE - The Government will evaluate the offeror's experience in relation to current or previous work performed in similar size and scope to this requirement. <br /><br />Sub-factor 2: UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT - The Government will evaluate the offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in the SOW and the extent to which potential risks are identified and mitigated.</p>
<p><br />PAST PERFORMANCE: The Government will evaluate past performance of three (3) previous contracts for current relevancy (within 3 years), with at least one (1) previous or current contract with relevancy within the past 12 months based on how well the contractor performed on projects of similar dollar value, scope, and complexity. Offerors are advised that the Government may use past performance information obtained from centralized past performance databases and sources other than those identified by the offeror and the information obtained may be used for both the responsibility determination and the best value decision. The absence of past performance data will be rated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Contracts listed may include those entered into with Government agencies or private sectors. For contractors with no relevant corporate past performance, the Government may take into account information regarding the past performance of predecessor companies, key personnel with relevant past performance. The Government will evaluate the Past Performance Elements specified in the Past Performance Questionnaire, Attachment 1. Offeror's shall distribute the questionnaire included in the solicitation as an attachment to their references so the form can be completed and submitted directly to the Government.</p>
<p>Performance. Offerors shall provide a specific narrative explanation of each contract listed in Section 1 describing the objectives achieved and detailing how the effort is relevant to the requirements of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(a) For any contracts that did not/do not meet original schedule or technical performance requirements, provide a brief explanation of the reason(s) for the shortcomings and any corrective action(s) taken to avoid recurrence. The offerors shall list each time the delivery schedule was revised and provide an explanation of why the revision was necessary. All Requests for Deviation and Requests for Waiver shall be addressed with respect to causes and corrective actions. The offerors shall also provide a copy of any Cure Notices or Show Cause Letters received on each contract listed and a description of any corrective action implemented by the offeror or proposed subcontractor. The offerors shall indicate if any of the contracts listed were terminated and the type and reasons for the termination.</p>
<p><br />New Corporate Entities. New corporate entities may submit data on prior contracts involving its officers and employees. However, in addition to the other requirements in this section, the offeror shall discuss in detail the role performed by such persons in the prior contracts cited. Information should be included in the files described in the sections above.</p>
<p>Past Performance Questionnaire. The offeror shall complete Part I of the Past Performance Questionnaire and e-mail the questionnaire to the Government and private sector technical representative responsible for the past/current contract. The POC's shall be instructed to electronically complete Part II of the questionnaire and e-mail the entire questionnaire to the Contract Specialist, Worrells.deborah@dol.gov no later than May 9, 2012 at 4:00 p.m. EST. The offeror shall also e-mail to the Contract Specialist a list of all the POC's who were sent a questionnaire. The Government must receive this list no later than May 4, 2012 at 4:00 p.m. EST. The POC List shall be submitted in Word for Windows Table Format to include the following fields: Solicitation Number; Company Name; Contract Number; Government Agency; POC Last Name, First Name; POC Title; POC Telephone Number; POC E-Mail Address; Date E-Mailed to POC (month/day). Please note, that the Past Performance Questionnaire will not be a part of the resultant contract.</p>
<p>PRICE. The offeror shall complete Cost/Price Schedule, with pricing for the base and each option period. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factors I, Technical (See Table 1), Adjectival ratings for Factor II (See Table 2), Past Performance will be Low Risk, High Risk, and Unknown Risk. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor III, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:</p>
<p>Factor A- Technical, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale</p>
<p><br />ADJECTIVAL DEFINITION<br /><br />Outstanding:&nbsp; A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good: &nbsp;A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.<br /><br />Acceptable: A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements. <br /><br />Unacceptable: A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.<br /><br />Factor B-, Past Performance, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale</p>
<p><br />ADJECTIVAL DESCRIPTION<br /><br />Low Risk: Little doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.<br /><br />Moderate: Some doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.<br /><br />High Risk: Significant doubt exists, based on the Offeror's performance record, that the Offeror can perform the proposed effort.<br /><br />Unknown Risk: Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no favorable or unfavorable evaluation significance.</p>

<p><br />PART II. EVALUATION (TO BE COMPLETED BY POINT OF CONTACT - RESPONDENT)<br />For each performance element identified below, references should evaluate performance of the firm or individual identified in Part 1 of this form. Where the reference lacks sufficient information to provide an evaluation for a particular performance element, this should be noted. Where any deficiency or unfavorable information is identified, the reference should identify any mitigating factors that may weigh in favor for the person/firm on whose behalf the reference is provided (i.e., problems due to causes outside the contractor's control). An individual within your organization that is knowledgeable of the contractor's day-to-day operations and overall performance should complete this questionnaire. However, that individual is encouraged to supplement their own knowledge of the contractor's performance with the judgment of others within their organization, as applicable.<br /><br />The following chart depicts the ratings that are to be used to evaluate the contractor's performance:<br />LOW RISK (L) MODERATE RISK (M) HIGH RISK (H) UNKNOWN RISK (U)</p>

<p><br />MODERATE RISK (M) - Performance met all contract requirements and exceeded some. There were few minor problems, which the contractor resolved in a timely, effective manner.<br /><br />HIGH RISK (H) - Performance met contract requirements. There were some minor problems; corrective actions taken by the contractor were satisfactory.<br /><br />UNKNOWN RISK (U) - Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no favorable or unfavorable evaluation significance.<br /><br />NOTE: UNKNOWN RISK WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT TO THE CUSTOMER PROVIDING A NOT APPLICABLE (N/A) TO ANY OF THE QUESTIONS.<br /><br />When responding to the questions listed, circle the letter that most accurately describes the contractor's performance or situation. For any exceptional, neutral, marginal, or unsatisfactory rating, please provide explanatory narratives in the remarks block. These narratives need not be lengthy, just detailed. If a question is not applicable, circle N/A. If you circle a Yes/No answer that is marked with an asterisk (*), please provide a corresponding explanation in the remarks block.

<p>NIST has been in collaboration with the FBI since 1968 in conducting research on automated fingerprint-matching systems. Since 2008, with the help and support from the FBI, the current legacy fingerprint-matching test environment at NIST is in a transitional phase to update NIST's current supercomputer based architecture to the new blade-based Next Generation Identification (NGI) system currently in operation at the FBI.</p>
<p>The new blade-based NGI system architecture utilizes a fingerprint-matching system designed specifically for the FBI's current operational system, in which NIST is<br />required by the FBI to install at NIST on FBI supplied hardware to remain in sync with the FBI's operational system. Transition and updating of the NIST fingerprint-matching system to duplicate the fingerprint-matching subsystem of the FBI's new NGI system is critical for NIST to remain in sync with the operational behavior of the FBI system, to ensure repeatability of NIST's testing framework, and to maintain the collaboration.</p>
<p>Since the specific operating system by RedHat is the only operating system that is identical to the FBI's subsystem operating system, NIST requires the Redhat brand Enterprise Linux operating system software to be installed on the FBI supplied hardware already in NIST's possession.</p>
<p>The RedHat Enterprise Linux operating system software will integrate with other applications installed on the hardware system and will replicate the FBI's fingerprint-matching subsystem. Replication of critical performance characteristics is necessary for repeatable and parallel testing and comparative performance analysis with the FBI's subsystem. Any other operating system would introduce unacceptable uncertainties in subsystem performance replication, compromise replication integrity; deem comparative analysis questionable whether outputs differ or match; and deviate from the FBI's intent, purpose and requirements for projects.</p>

DIAPR 2010-14 (October 2010) Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System
	(a)  FAR 42.1502 directs all Federal agencies to collect past performance information on contracts.  The Department of the Interior (DOI) has implemented the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to comply with this regulation.  One or more past performance evaluations will be conducted in order to record your contract performance as required by FAR 42.15. 
	(b)  The past performance evaluation process is a totally paperless process using CPARS.  CPARS is a web-based system that allows for electronic processing of the performance evaluation report.  Once the report is processed, it is available in the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) for Government use in evaluating past performance as part of a source selection action.
	(c)  We request that you furnish the Contracting Officer with the name, position title, phone number, and email address for each person designated to have access to your firm's past performance evaluation(s) for the contract no later than 30 days after award.  Each person granted access will have the ability to provide comments in the Contractor portion of the report and state whether or not the Contractor agrees with the evaluation, before returning the report to the Assessing Official.  The report information must be protected as source selection sensitive information not releasable to the public.
	(d)  When your Contractor Representative(s) (Past Performance Points of Contact) are registered in CPARS, they will receive an automatically-generated email with detailed login instructions.  Further details, systems requirements, and training information for CPARS is available at http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/.  The CPARS User Manual, registration for On Line Training for Contractor Representatives, and a practice application may be found at this site.
	(e)  Within 60 days after the end of a performance period, the Contracting Officer will complete an interim or final past performance evaluation, and the report will be accessible at http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/.  Contractor Representatives may then provide comments in response to the evaluation, or return the evaluation without comment.  Comments are limited to the space provided in Block 22.  Your comments should focus on objective facts in the Assessing Official's narrative and should provide your views on the causes and ramifications of the assessed performance.  In addition to the ratings and supporting narratives, blocks 1 - 17 should be reviewed for accuracy, as these include key fields that will be used by the Government to identify your firm in future source selection actions.  If you elect not to provide comments, please acknowledge receipt of the evaluation by indicating "No comment" in Block 22, and then signing and dating Block 23 of the form.  Without a statement in Block 22, you will be unable to sign and submit the evaluation back to the Government.  If you do not sign and submit the CPAR within 30 days, it will automatically be returned to the Government and will be annotated: "The report was delivered/received by the contractor on (date).  The contractor neither signed nor offered comment in response to this assessment."  Your response is due within 30 calendar days after receipt of the CPAR.
	(f)  The following guidelines apply concerning your use of the past performance evaluation:
        	(1)  Protect the evaluation as "source selection information."  After review, transmit the evaluation by completing and submitting the form through CPARS.  If for some reason you are unable to view and/or submit the form through CPARS, contact the Contracting Officer for instructions.  
	(2)  Strictly control access to the evaluation within your organization.  Ensure the evaluation is never released to persons or entities outside of your control.
	(3)  Prohibit the use of or reference to evaluation data for advertising, promotional material, preaward surveys, responsibility determinations, production readiness reviews, or other similar purposes.
	(g)  If you wish to discuss a past performance evaluation, you should request a meeting in writing to the Contracting Officer no later than seven days following your receipt of the evaluation.  The meeting will be held in person or via telephone or other means during your 30-day review period.
    	(h)  A copy of the completed past performance evaluation will be available in CPARS for your viewing and for Government use supporting source selection actions after it has been finalized.

  The contracting officer will validate contractors technical capability to perform by verifying that the contractor that supplied a quote has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract.  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, contractors will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the quote to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.  


(f)  A written notice of award otherwise furnished to the successful Quoting Contractor within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a purchase order without further action by either party.
  Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may place a purchase order, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<SUBJECT>Rapid Improvement of Existing Handheld Technologies for AIT Anomaly Resolution
<SOLNBR>BAA12-08
<ARCHDATE>08092012
<CONTACT>Amalia Rodezno, Contract Specialist, Email BAA12-08@hq.dhs.gov
<DESC>The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-296) states that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science &amp; Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) will "support basic and applied homeland security research to promote revolutionary changes in technologies; advance the development, testing and evaluation, and deployment of critical homeland security technologies; and accelerate the prototyping and deployment of technologies that would address homeland security vulnerabilities." Pursuant to this mission, DHS S&amp;T's Explosives Division (EXD) recognizes the need for state-of-the-art passenger screening at checkpoints that shall effectively and reliably resolve anomalies on passengers during secondary screening. TSA has deployed Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) to screen passengers at aviation checkpoints. Current resolution of anomalies presented on the AIT is limited to directed, and sometimes sensitive, area pat downs. This initiative is focused on reducing the number of passenger pat downs required to resolve AIT anomalies. This capability shall be implemented as a handheld AIT anomaly resolution tool.
<p>This BAA sets forth the requirements to accomplish a variety of specific tasks related to the rapid improvement of existing handheld technologies designed to resolve AIT anomalies by improving the sensitivity of current systems as well as expand threat detection capabilities. The identified requirements presented here have a direct impact on meeting the requirements outlined in the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, Public Law 107-71.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>COMMANDANT (CG-9131) <br />U S COAST GUARD <br />OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS <br />2100 2ND ST SW STOP 7112 <br />WASHINGTON DC 20593-7112</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory.

In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), US Coast Guard, Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 2100 2nd Street, SW, Stop 7112 , Washington, D. C. 20593 -7112. Telephone (202) 372 3695.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. Solicitation number M00681-12-T-0059 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55 and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, current to DPN 20120224. The North American Classification System Code is 333319 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.
 This acquisition is a 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. Any quotations received from concerns other than small businesses will not be considered for award.

The Food Service Office of Camp Pendleton California  has a requirement for a scullery and a food waste collecting system to include removal of current dish machine and waste collecting system. SEE ITEM DESCRIPTION BELOW. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the offerer that represents the best value.  The following factors will be considered when determining the best value: adherence to the salient characteristics, price, and delivery terms.

ITEM DESCRIPTION TO INCLUDE QUANTITY AND SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS:
Manufacturers Brand Name, is for descriptive and informational purposes only to reflect the features essential to the minimum needs of the government.
 

CLIN 0001

STERO DISH MACHINE
QTY 1
STPCW-ER-20
Salient Characteristics
1.	Unload Section with a 24 Extended Vent Cowl
24 Extended Vent Cowl,  a Mars Air Door,  inter-wired so the air door comes on when the conveyor belt is in operation to facilitate the drying of dishware to prevent dishes being stored wet to prevent sanitation issues.

2.	Dual rinse tank technology achieves the perfect balance of productivity and water savings. High volume performance and low water consumption with a two-stage auxiliary rinse system.
98 gal. /hr. maximum final rinse consumption

3.	An Outboard Scrap Catchment
This allows the scrap catchment to be emptied while the machine is in operation

4.	Stainless Steel Steam Coil Tank 
Steam coils allow the condensed steam to be returned to the steam generator, a decided advantage when there is a question of purity of steam.
 A thermostat controls a steam solenoid valve and maintains the correct temperature. A steam trap is mounted on the steam return line.

5.	Door Safety Switches
Safety issue to prevent scalding in the event of accidental opening of the doors while machine is in operation

6.	Variable Conveyor Speed
The conveyor drive shall be a variable speed unit capable of adjustment from 2 to 12 feet per minute and shall be equipped with a reversing switch so the machine can be reversed in the event of jamming

7.	Stainless Steel Top Mounted Circuit Breaker Panel
Each motor is protected by an individual circuit breaker.  The pre-wiring of the machine terminates here for a single point connection, and one three- wire service is sufficient for connecting the electrical service.
  This is required because it will ensure that the warewashing system is wired correctly and that any electrical motor or element failure shall not shut the machine down.  In the event a motor failure, the breaker to that motor can be shut off and the machine can still be utilized until motor is fixed or replaced

8.	Automatic Fill with Water Level Control
Automatically fills each tank and maintains water level by a stainless steel float system and on an independent basis.  This is required due to the evaporation of the water in the tanks to ensure proper tank water levels. In addition, a separate control is provided with a lockout circuit, which will prevent the operation of the pumps until the tanks have been filled.

9.	Cold Water Aquastat
Cleaner dishware by food proteins are not baked onto the ware due to excessive heat

10.	Pumps and Motors
The motor shall have an easily removable front inspection plate and be self-draining.
  The extended shafts reduce the amount of heat absorbed by the motor from the heated wash and rinse tanks resulting in a longer life span of the motor.

11.	Final Rinse Arms
Final rinse arms are mounted above and below the ware.  The final rinse is activated only when ware is in the final rinse section by a rinse rake. Belt movement does not control rinse water use. The expended final rinse water is piped directly to the power rinse tank, and then piped to the power scrapper tank for reuse, bypassing the power wash tank completely.  This ensures that the wash detergent is not diluted. 

12.	 Automatic Energy Saving Shutdown
Keeps tank temperatures at the proper temperatures while shutting off the pump motors if machine is not in operation, reducing wear and tear on the motors.

13.	Electric Features
All wiring shall be numbered and color-coded for ease of troubleshooting

-REMOVE OLD DISH MACHINE AND TAKE TO BACK DOCK AREA FOR REMOVAL BY GOVERNMENT.
-UNCRATE AND SET NEW MACHINE IN PLACE AT MH 2403.

2.	Have processes in place to ensure timely and flexible delivery of radiopharmaceuticals. Contractor shall deliver the first daily delivery of routine pharmaceuticals before the beginning of the workday (before 8:00 AM, Monday - Friday, excluding Federal holidays) following the day that the order is placed. Contractor may deliver subsequent routine daily deliveries at contractor's convenience as long as the delivery arrives before the next patient's appointment arrival-time as indicated on the dose order form. We would prefer doses arrive 15-30 minutes before the next-patient appointment time since patients often arrive early.

4.	Supply the previously-mentioned radiopharmaceuticals within one (1) hour of order for any items indicated as "1 Hour" in the expedited delivery column and on the same day as ordered for any items as "Same Day" in the expedited delivery column. This paragraph applies only to deliveries specifically ordered as expedited. The parties may bi-laterally agree to a different delivery date/time. 
5.	Be USP-797 compliant and provide FDA compliant products (not just radiochemical compliant), for patient safety and compliance with VHA Blood Tagging Directive. Contractor must maintain continuous certification with State of California for Sterile Compounding permit. 
6.	Have a redundant process in place that allows turnaround time for USP-797 compliant White Blood Cell tagging within about 4-5 hours: this includes same-day kit delivery, blood pickup, tagging, and then redelivery of tagged blood by or before about 4:00 PM.
7.	Have a dual supply system for Technetium generators to assure supplies during periods of radioactive-material shortages. Have regional backup that is capable of supplying all required radiopharmaceuticals in the event of unforeseen local supply disruption. 
8.	All contractor personnel requiring access to VA Facilities must meet the security background check requirements including completing a NACI type investigation and submitting a SF 85. The VA reserves the right to bar any contractor personnel from its premises.

<p>A question has been asked regarding section 2.10 of the Purchase Description.</p>
<p>Question: 2.10 Single Sideband Phase Noise. The frequency range of 100 KHz to 50 GHz with a carrier&bull; offset of 2.5E-05 * Carrier frequency (Hz) the single sideband phase noise shall not exceed -40 dBc(Hz).</p>
<p>I believe the offset of 2.5E-05 should not have the minus sign. I believe it should read 250 KHz or 2.5 E 05 Hz. Please clarify.</p>
<p><br />Response: To avoid confusion, lets change it to 250 KHz.</p>

The items listed here are provided as a "sampling" of supplies ordered as a basis for price & technical acceptability purposes only.

If the item comes from a country other than who is under the TAA law, the govmnt can not purchase it.<BR><BR>AP3150 is not a valid number. Want to quote AR3150.  Is that what you are requesting?

<p>The CESC Limited (CESC) (the "Grantee") invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to complete a feasibility study that will develop requirements and specifications for a smart grid implementation roadmap for CESC as well as a smart grid pilot that will be designed as part of the study. The project is will provide for greater system integration with distributed generators as well as to help provide application models for other distribution networks in India.</p>
<p>India's ongoing economic expansion continues to face risks related to inadequate and irregular supply of electric power. India's energy demand is predicted to more than double by 2030, requiring significant investment in generation, transmission and distribution capacity, and potentially increasing the frequency of power outages even in urban areas. Indian utilities face unprecedented challenges from a growing demand for high-quality, reliable electricity, increasingly stringent regulation, environmental concerns, and rising customer expectations, which require utilities to transform traditional electricity generation, transmission and delivery systems. Smart grid technologies are seen to provide a solution to this set of challenges, providing the ability to improve the quality and reliability of service, reduce technical and commercial power losses, integrate consumer use with peak and off-peak demand periods, and take advantage of distributed generation potential.</p>
<p>The private sector utility CESC shares these challenges with other Indian power utility companies, and currently suffers from transmission and distribution losses of approximately 13 percent. Transmission and distribution losses range up to 40 percent for public sector utilities in India. Nevertheless, CESC hopes to achieve transmission and distribution loss levels of 6 percent or less, which is more in line with international utility standards. The feasibility study will provide a roadmap for the development of a comprehensive implementation plan for a smart grid rollout in its distribution system. The study includes a design of smart grid pilot activities as part of the study and would assess the technological, economic, regulatory and financial viability of implementing smart grid projects in the CESC network. It will also focus on a review and analysis of the requirements and recommend a pilot project and system-wide upgrades including distribution system automation, telecommunications upgrades, IT system plans, integrating smart meters, home area networks and other relevant smart grid interactive communication technologies and management systems into the CESC distribution and management system. CESC has already initiated certain small trials with Ring Monitoring Units (RMU) and several hundred automated meter reading (AMR) applications. CESC anticipates that the smart grid project and technology solutions would immediately help it in its ongoing quest to improve the quality and reliability of service while reducing technical and commercial power losses.</p>
<p>The objective of this FS is to provide recommendations for improving the efficiency and reliability of CESC's 2.5 million customer distribution system in Kolkata, India. The project will address a range of needed improvements and investments including the integration of smart meters and automated meter reading into CESC's distribution system. In addition, the study will develop requirements and specifications for a Smart Grid implementation roadmap as well as the design of a Smart Grid pilot project. This initiative is expected to provide for greater system integration with other power generators in India as well as to help provide application models for other electricity distribution networks throughout the country.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: USAF Imaging &amp; Targeting Support (AFMC ASC/WIN) Synopsis. ASC/WIN requests information on the following capabilities:<br /><br />&bull; ISR supporting find, fix, track, target assess for RPAs<br />&bull; Detection of CC&amp;D targets<br />&bull; Post Optical Bar Camera (OBC) broad area synoptic coverage<br />&bull; Capability to detect/collect in dense/cluttered terrain and denied access areas<br />&bull; Production of synthetic background clutter<br />&bull; Characterizing "blue" airborne ISR capabilities<br />&bull; Collect specific hyper-spectral ISR (imagery) in anti-access/area-denial<br />&bull; Integrated air and missile (IAMD) - detect, track and ID targets as "blue" vs. "red"<br />&bull; ISR supporting find, fix, track, target, assess theater ballistic missiles<br />&bull; Locate tunnels<br />&bull; Provide surveillance on open seas and littoral approaches to U.S.<br />&bull; Collecting true calibrated RCS values in denied areas<br />&bull; Detect, (characterize) and track dismounts in densely populated areas<br />&bull; Multi-INT collection in triple canopy jungle<br />&bull; Reliable airborne, stand-off data collection against long range threats<br />&bull; Detect, track and ID personnel of interest<br />&bull; Recognizing, categorizing and mitigating airborne SAR artifacts<br />&bull; Ability to automatically identify targets from processed imagery<br />&bull; Collecting and characterizing information on underground facilities<br />&bull; Meeting the projected ISR bandwidth and data storage requirements for 2022-2032<br />&bull; All-weather motion imagery<br /><br />The ISR system of systems (SoS) would be deployed on airborne platforms operating at various altitudes to support specific operational conditions and with associated&nbsp;PEDnetworks. ASC/WINPA is conducting market research to identify what research has been accomplished in this field as well as to see what technology currently exists or could be modified for this need. This market research will potentially shape Air Force efforts in the FY14-24 timeframe. ASC/WIN seeks industry white papers to support this market research effort by&nbsp;8 May 12. The intent of this RFI is to identify potential candidate programs and technology efforts related to the development of end-to-end ISR functionality of sensors and associated data algorithms. Components related to ISR sensors include, but are not limited to: electronics, gimbals, cryogenics, diffraction gratings, focusing lenses, FPAs, ROICs, atmospheric and temperature correction algorithms/techniques, airborne processing, interference filters, spectrometer, HRI subsystems, etc. These components do not need to be part of an existing sensor system; research and development of these components may be ongoing independent of a full system. Responses are sought from industry, academia, Government agencies, and military services. Current research should indicate the Technology Readiness Level of the system or component.<br /><br />ASC/WIN desires this market research across industry, academia and service/Government programs for candidate programs/technology efforts with projected capabilities that may improve current and future airborne GEOINT sensors and end-to-end functionality. Candidate technologies should, if needed, project modifications or upgrades, forecast improvements or apply new technology process in order to meet operational goals. The following ground rules/assumptions apply:<br /><br />&bull; For solely component technologies - clearly explain how the component will benefit end-to-end sensor functionality<br />&bull; If applicable, responses shall identify and new supporting architecture or infrastructure (i.e. cryogenics, processing/PED, computer resources, storage requirements (environmental requirements), ground control, communications, etc.) required for the technology;<br />&bull; If applicable, responses shall identify and Unique Tool and/or Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE), as well as any proven integration (have they been flown/tested?);<br />&bull; Responses shall identify technical and security POCs.<br /><br />All correspondence submitted will be controlled as proprietary. After reviewing the submitted White Papers, the Government may request technical exchanges and/or site surveys of respondents' facilities. <br /><br />The Government anticipates the information will be used to plan and program the required efforts to support airborne GEOINT objectives.<br /><br />The Government invites industry to submit White Papers (unclassified or classified up to TOP SECRET) on their concepts or technologies at any time on or before&nbsp;8 May 12. Guidance on the suggested White Paper format is attached. Please ensure all appropriate security procedures and policies are followed when responding to this RFI.

<DESC>RESPONSE IS PROVIDED TO QUESTION.

Question:  It is not discussed in the specifications or plans but, in our opinion it is impossible to maintain roadway traffic through the construction site during the construction of this project due to the available ROW, height of fills, location of fills, location of cuts, amount of water flow in the river, and location of new bridge construction relative to the existing roadway.
With that being said, we can close the road to traffic, correct?

RESPONSE:  Once the water is diverted around the project site, no water will be in the area of the bridge.  The roadway is to remain open at all times and a detour road will be implemented.  Bidders are to determine a plan for the detour and price accordingly in their bid.  There is enough room for the detour at the project site.
Post award, the contractor will be required to submit a traffic control plan that includes a detour plan.  
The project site is a bus route with several homes on both sides of the river.  Closing the roadway for this contract will not be approved.

<a href="mailto:dlavergne@blm.gov">dlavergne@blm.gov</a>
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for the feed and care of, adoption of, training of and transportation of up to 200 wild horses/burros.  The contractor must provide all necessary labor, materials and facilities to:  Feed and care for up to 200 wild horses and burros on pasture and/or corral - Handle, sort, load, unload, and provide necessary veterinary and farrier care to the animals - Train the animals using non-restraint methods; and - Conduct training clinics and seminars to persons who have been approved by the BLM to adopt wild horses or burros.   Requirements: The contractor shall maintain a minimum of 100 and a maximum of 200 animals at his/her facility, WHICH MUST BE LOCATED IN THE STATES OF EITHER WYOMING OR NEBRASKA and WITHIN A 150-MILE RADIUS OF CHEYENNE, WYOMING.  Up to 10 of these animals may be burros (jacks or jennies).  All horses will be mares or geldings between the ages of six (6) months old and five (5) years old, unless both parties agree (on a case by case basis) to accept a mare or gelding over the age of five (5).  No more than one half (1/2) of the horses held at the facility, at any one time, will be under the age of two (2) years.  BLM will minimize as much as possible the number of pregnant mares sent to the contractor.  The contractor will inspect the animals when first delivered.  He/she will then advise the BLM COR or PI of any animals that have physical defects that may make the animal unadoptable.  The BLM COR or PI will then determine, with a veterinarians recommendation when necessary, if the animal should be placed at another holding facility where training is not available.  The contractor shall gather all animals on pasture at BLMs request.  A one-week notice shall be given for gathering. The contractor shall provide for adoption as many of the animals maintained at his/her facility as possible each year.  The contractor may gentle or train the animals to any level necessary to get them adopted and may adopt untrained animals.  All potential adoptions at the contractors facility will be by scheduled appointment, scheduled BLM satellite adoption event (locally or out of state), or via the internet adoption system.   Any qualified adopters that select animals at the contractors facility will have to provide applications, signed PMACAs, and payment to the Wyoming State Office.  Animals adopted at BLM satellite adoptions will be adopted in the same manner as untrained animals offered there.  The contractor may conduct training clinics at his/her facility for qualified adopters.The contractor will be requested to transport animals to adoption sites specified by the Government and demonstrate the amount of training each animal has received.  If specifically requested by the BLM COR or PI, the contractor may transport adopted animals up to 300 miles from the contractors facility to another BLM adoption facility or to an adopters facility.  The contractor may be requested to pick up and transport previously adopted animals that have been relinquished or repossessed by the BLM.  If specifically requested by the BLM COR or PI, the contractor may transport these animals up to 400 miles from the contractors facility to another BLM adoption facility or back to the contractors facility.  As the number of animals at the contractors facility decline, the COR and/or PI will make arrangements for BLM to bring replacement animals, delivered by either semi-truck or horse trailer.  Delivery by horse trailer will depend on the availability of animals within a one day driving radius. The Contractor shall be paid to attend satellite adoption events and/or provide gentling and training demonstrations as requested and approved in advance by the BLM.  The contractor shall receive a daily fee which will cover reimbursement of all associated travel related expenses and labor for him/herself and up to two assistants. All training will be conducted using least resistance techniques.  Except for those animals in training, animals will be maintained on pasture.  Animals on pasture shall have free access to water and those in training shall have daily access to water.   Supplemental feed including hay and protein supplement will be fed as necessary to maintain the animals in an acceptable body condition (Henneke condition score of 4).  The BLM will make every effort to deliver animals to the contractors facility that fit this body condition in order to prevent the contractor from incurring unneeded expenses to get the animal to the desired body condition.  If an animal cannot maintain that condition, the contractor shall isolate the animal in a separate sick pen and provide special attention including nutritional and or veterinary care.  Hay must be good quality, non-moldy, non-dusty grass, alfalfa, or a mix. All animals shall be maintained, treated, and handled in a humane manner and in accordance with all applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations. The animals hooves shall be trimmed as needed to maintain the proper shape and length of the feet. FACILITIES -Except for a portable tip chute (which will be provided by BLM for the purpose of providing veterinary care and farrier care) the contractor will provide all necessary facilities.  The training facility shall have pens and runways to use for the movement of animals.  All pens and runways shall be 6 feet high and of sufficient strength to hold wild horses.  Acceptable materials in order of BLMs preference are: Pipe, wood, and/or mesh wire with openings smaller than 2 X 4 inches.  Mesh wire with larger openings must be covered with plastic snow fence. Corrals constructed of mesh wire must be covered with plastic snow fence or equipped with sight boards (2 X 6 inch lumber).  The sight board shall be located at the upper and middle portion of the corral fence.  Corrals that are constructed of pipe or wood must have proper spacing between members (no more than 12 inches). A minimum space of 144 square feet of corral space shall be provided for each animal that is in training and exercised each day in accordance with 43 CFR 4750.3-2(3)(I).  The training facility shall provide separate corrals for each animal being trained with some type of wind break or shield appropriate for the area.  The contractor must provide an indoor facility for training horses and conducting training clinics during the winter and inclement weather.  This facility should be at least 10000 square feet in size. The training facility must be clean and the animal waste removed at least once per month.  The facility must be designed and built to comply with all applicable Federal and State regulations relating to livestock waste control and off-site pollution.  The entire facility must have sufficient drainage to eliminate any standing water and/or muddy conditions in the areas where the animals are being held. Pasture fencing may be of common fencing materials but must be of sufficient height and condition to prevent the escape of these wild horses.  The contractor is responsible for the recapture of any animals that may escape.  Forage condition in the pastures must be sufficient enough so that the animals are content and do not pressure the fences. Pastures must have natural or manmade shelter.  Animals on pasture shall have free access to water at all times. Delivery by horse trailer will depend on the availability of animals within a one day driving radius.  This is not intended to be a complete list of the specifications. The full requirement will be posted in solicitation L12PS00318, which will be available at http://www.fbo.gov on or about April 15, 2012. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award. Contracting Officer, Danny Lavergne, dlavergne@blm.gov

The total estimated hours for the extension is 16,340 hours and 14,840 for the option period.
  This sole source acquisition is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  The contract extension is for continuation of services necessary to conduct environmental surveys and studies support consisting of conducting nature, cultural, pollution prevention, and geophysical resource-specific surveys, studies, analyses, environmental planning and documentation in the Western Mojave/Great Basin/California desert regions, and the Southern California Channel Island coastal areas.  Locations for this effort include China Lake, CA, Point Mugu, CA, San Nicholas Island, CA.  Specific efforts include reviews of  mission compatibility environmental support needs at the Sea Range; increases in the functionality of the Mission Compatibility Analysis Tool (MCAT); evaluations of historic buildings on San Nicholas Island; public outreach and mitigation tracking related to the three Range Environmental Impact Statements; and additional cultural resources survey work in newly identified test sites that were added to the China Lake EIS.
  Epsilon Systems Solutions is the current contractor providing effort under this contract. They have the required workforce, expertise, experience and are currently working on-going projects. Continued support is mission critical, as all test and facilities support requirements are to be addressed for environmental impacts on a daily and weekly basis. Failure to do so will result in loss of range time and direct operational impacts to supporting the warfighter. Award of the contract modification is expected on or about 02 July 2012.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  However, any firm must clearly show their ability to perform the work without compromising the quality, accuracy, reliability, and schedule that would affect the war fighter.
 Questions should be addressed to the Commander, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, 429 E. Bowen Road, MS 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108, Attn:  Deborah McKellar, Code 254330D; or by the preferred method of electronic mail to deborah.mckellar@navy.mil.
Notes 22 & 26 apply.

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>&nbsp; The United States Government seeks to lease approximately 5,236 ANSI/BOMA Office Area square feet of contiguous office space in Milledgeville, GA. The lease term is for ten (10) years, five (5) years firm. The government reserves the right to consider only existing buildings, and not new construction, in this procurement.
<p>The space must be located within the area delineated by the following boundaries:</p>
<p>&bull; North: Dunlap Road<br />&bull; South: Franklin Street<br />&bull; East: Elbert Street<br />&bull; West: Hwy 441/bypass</p>
<p>The following criteria shall apply to all space considered by the Government:<br />&bull; The space must have easy access to available parking for visitors and employees.<br />&bull; The space should not be located within the immediate vicinity of railroad tracks.<br />&bull; Sites which are located directly on a highway or six-lane thoroughfare shall not be considered in the following instances:<br />o The two directions of traffic are separated by a physical barrier or traffic indicator which does not permit access from either direction within a block;<br />o The location access is directly from a highway, unless there is a traffic control device within two blocks or equivalent from the proposed office space.<br />&bull; To allow for visibility to the public, this agency's office space shall be located not more than the equivalent of two city blocks from a primary or secondary street serving the office. As an alternative to direct visibility, the lessor shall provide acceptable signage from the primary or secondary street at no additional cost. The route from the primary or secondary street shall be direct. Locations which have obscure, difficult access or which require additional turns shall not be considered.</p>
<p>The Government prefers street-level, contiguous (same floor). Contiguous upper floor space on one floor which meets GSA lease criteria and has handicapped accessible elevator service to the government office floor is an acceptable alternative. It is preferred that the storage and/or multipurpose rooms are located contiguous with the main office space. However, these rooms only, and their associated square footage, may be separated from the main office area by a public corridor. Elevator service shall consist of a minimum of two accessible elevators which will serve the floor proposed for the government. One of the accessible elevators may serve as a freight elevator.</p>
<p>Space should be located in a prime commercial office district with attractive, prestigious, professional surroundings with a prevalence of modern design and/or tasteful rehabilitation in modern use. Space should be Class A, professional quality office space. All services, utilities and tenant improvements must be provided as part of the rental consideration.</p>
<p>The overall dimensions of the space shall have a maximum length to width ratio of 2 to 1. It is preferred that blocks of space allow maximum flexibility for furniture placement, i.e., few or no columns or other obstructions, rectangular in shape, no curves or off-sets, and with large open areas. Space requiring ramps inside the office will not be acceptable. Columns in the space must be at least 20 feet from any interior wall and from each other (clear distance) and be no more than two feet square. The space must meet the Federal Government's standards for fire safety and handicapped accessibility and be located outside a 100-year floodplain. The space must be capable of having windows on at least three sides of the building.</p>
<p>A minimum of 30 surface parking spaces shall be available at no cost, or at reasonable commercial rates, for visitors and employees within a two-block radius of the space. On-site parking shall be in accordance with local ordinance.</p>
<p>Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building's ownership.</p>
<p>If you desire to submit a location for inspection, please forward information by 5:00 PM EST on MAY 8, 2012 All expressions of interest should be in writing and include building name and address, location of space in the building, and rentable square feet offered. Please reference Project No. 1GA2048. Please submit information to Barbara Jeanneret by e mail or by US mail at the address below:</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Acquisition Operations (OAO), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) located at 260 Industrial Way West, Eatontown, New Jersey 07724, issued a sole source award to a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) under the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(5), "when a statute expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made through another agency or from a specified source", as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  6.302-5.  For this action, 38 U.S.C. 8127(c), known as the Veterans First Contracting Program, provides the authority to directly contract with a SDVOSB.  Firm-Fixed-Price, Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract VA118-12-D-0024, was awarded to Tridec Technologies, LLC., 6990 Drywood Place, Huber Heights, Ohio 45424, for the development of the Acquisition Business System (ABS) Customer Acquisition Portal (CAP).  ABS is comprised of the Virtual Office of Acquisition (VOA) and the integration of the VOA with other VA contracting systems (eCMS, ITARS, etc).

The ordering period of the IDIQ is 24 months with an established ordering ceiling of $4,974,195.50.

<DESC><p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The International Boundary and Water Commission, United States Section (USIBWC) proposes to solicit on the basis of other than full and open competition for a new contract with the City of San Diego.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The proposed contract is for receiving water sampling, monitoring, analysis and reporting service for the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The estimated amount of this action is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,00 per year for the USIBWC half of the cost for the environmental services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The City of San Diego (CSD) is contributing all of the superintendence, labor, and equipment to accomplish the monitoring and testing that represents half of the actual costs of performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The action will result in a firm fixed price contract.</span><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">In September, 1997 the International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico (IBWC) constructed an International Wastewater Treatment Plant (IWTP) in the City of San Diego, California to serve the city of Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This treatment plant was constructed under IBWC Minute No. 283, and is operated under the clauses contained in IBWC Minute 296.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The IWTP receives and treats raw wastewater generated by the City of Tijuana, and discharges the treated effluent into the Pacific Ocean through a Land Outfall pipeline, and Ocean Outfall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The IWTP is operated under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit No. 96-50, issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Identified within the NPDES permit is a Sampling, Monitoring and Reporting program for the receiving waters of the IWTP effluent which extends north and south over an area in the vicinity of the discharge point for the Ocean Outfall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The requirements for the description of services of this document originate from the NPDES permit requirements for the IWTP. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">In July, 1990, the International Boundary and Water Commission, U.S. Section signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the City of San Diego for sharing of design, and construction cost of the South Bay Land Outfall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, as part of this MOU, the U.S. Section and the City of San Diego agreed to a 50/50 share in the ownership of the Land Outfall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In January, 1995, the International Boundary and Water Commission, U.S. Section signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the City of San Diego for sharing of design, and construction cost of the South Bay Ocean Outfall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As part of this MOA, the U.S. Section and the City of San Diego agreed to share in the ownership of the Ocean Outfall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ownership share of the Ocean Outfall is .3994 for the City of San Diego, and .6006 for the U.S. Section.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The City of San Diego participated in the cost sharing of the Land and Ocean Outfalls for the purpose of using these facilities for their future South Bay Reclamation Treatment Plant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The City's South Bay Reclamation Plant was completed on May 6, 2002, and the City is discharging treated effluent through the South Bay Land Outfall and the South Bay Ocean Outfall to the Pacific Ocean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The effluent from the two wastewater treatment plants, the IWTP and the City Reclamation Plant, is combined and is indistinguishable after discharge into the Pacific Ocean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The City of San Diego South Bay Reclamation Plant is operated under a NPDES discharge permit similar to the NPDES permit issued for the IWTP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In recognition of the same discharge point for the combined effluent of the two treatment plants, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board has issued the City of San Diego a NPDES permit with a similar, and in many cases an identical, Sampling, Monitoring and Reporting program to that of the IWTP NPDES permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The City of San Diego currently operates an advanced primary wastewater treatment facility at Pt. Loma, and the South Bay Reclamation wastewater facility within the City of San Diego.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both treatment plants are operated under NPDES permits issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board and require Sampling, Monitoring and Reporting programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The City of San Diego has been conducting this sampling, monitoring and reporting program for the Pt. Loma facility, and for the South Bay Reclamation facility for many years, using their own equipment, resources and staff.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The new solicitation for ocean outfall sampling and monitoring remains a sole-source contract. The owners of the outfall line remain the USIBWC and the City of San Diego.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The last permit from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board has expired.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However a federal court order issued March 21, 2012 continues to apply the previous permit for an additional six months, as the emissions are out of the required parameters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The USIBWC Acquisitions Division (ACQ) is actively working to plan and issue a solicitation to obtain these services for a base period and four option years under IBM12R0001 and the contemplated contract IBM12C0001.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, a condition of the new contract has to be renegotiation based upon a new or revised permit that impacts the cost of performance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Since the City of San Diego is performing the Sampling, Monitoring and Reporting program for their own South Bay Reclamation Plant at many of the identical monitoring stations for the International Wastewater Treatment Plant, the City of San Diego has expressed a willingness to cost share these two programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Significant savings to the federal government and the City of San Diego per year can be realized by sharing the two monitoring programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it is only if the City of San Diego is allowed to perform the work involved in the program, as the City does not intend to bid their portion of the work out, and will not share in the costs if the government solicits for a Contractor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Savings to be realized will be on costs of performing the on and off shore sampling, analysis of samples and data obtained, documentation and forms required, and in maintaining the database of results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, since the City of San Diego has on staff trained technical personnel capable of interpreting monitoring data and laboratory results, the federal government will benefit by having access to these personnel and not having to hire occasional consultants for the interpretation of the International Wastewater Treatment Plant data. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In recognition of the co-ownership of the land and ocean outfall facilities, and the substantial savings to both the City of San Diego and the federal government for sharing of the Sampling, Monitoring and Reporting programs, it is advantageous for the International Boundary &amp; Water Commission, U. S. Section, to enter into a contract with the City of San Diego for the providing of the receiving water sampling, monitoring, analysis and reporting service for the International Wastewater Treatment Plant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Actions to Increase Competition: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A synopsis will be published in the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 (e) (2).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The synopsis will serve as a notice of intent for the U.S. Section to enter into a contract with the City of San Diego.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no intent to increase competition and the CSD and USIBWC own the ocean outfall line and the owners are self-performing the work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is anticipated that all subsequent requirements of this type will continue to be awarded to the City of San Diego for the reasons identified above.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Market Research:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A market survey was conducted as reflected in the IBM Form 158 to obtain the concurrence of the USIBWC SADBU and the SBA Procurement Center Representative (PCR).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The City of San Diego has been conducting the sampling, monitoring, and reporting program for the Pt. Loma facility, the South Bay Reclamation facility and the International Wastewater Treatment Plant and they have the equipment, personnel, and other resources in place to provide the services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is expected that their proposed cost should be substantially less than their competitors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the City of San Diego would have an advantage over other firms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A competitive acquisition would not be possible.&nbsp; <br /></span></p>
