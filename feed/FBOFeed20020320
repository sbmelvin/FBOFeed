<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation,Federal Highway Administration(FHWA)will be seeking applications from State Departments of Transportation or public safety agencies as leaders of a team. The team would consist of a transportation service provider that operates a Traffic Management Center(TMC), a Traffic Management Center systems integrator, and a public safety Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) integrator. The team will integrate ITS technologies and CAD systems from multiple vendors across organizational boundaries. ITS standards and development procedures will be incorporated in a Field Operational Test      (FOT). The goal of this prospective Cooperative Agreement is to enable improved emergency response through the integration of public safety CAD systems and Advanced Traffic Management systems (ATMS) that are an integral part of most TMCs.

The FOT will integrate traffic management information systems and public safety dispatch information systems to enhance emergency response. This test will focus on the standards and technologies needed to facilitate the exchange of information between public safety CAD systems and TMC information systems. The FOT will be structured around the capability to manage multi-agency emergency incidents with significant multi-modal transportation challenges, ranging from automobile crashes to disaster response. Further, the FOT will enable benefits of enhancing field operations related to locating and responding to the incident, on-scene activities, and documenting the incident to be realized.  

Applicants will be required to provide at least 20 percent match to the federal funding. The FHWA anticipates making one or more awards under the Request For Applications (RFA). 
   
 The ENTIRE RFA will be published on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) at HTTP://WWW.EPS.GOV. Therefore, all prospective Applicants are instructed to obtain the RFA from those sources. The FHWA does not plan to issue any HARD copies of the RFA to any prospective Applicant. Prospective Applicants are instructed not to send letters, faxes or e-mails requesting the RFA. Telephoned, e-mailed and faxed requests for the RFA will not be accepted. Any subsequent amendments to the RFA will likewise be published on the EPS at the Internet address referenced above. The U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration does not plan to mail out copies of any such Amendments. It shall be the responsibility of each prospective Applicant to closely and frequently monitor the EPS for any possible Amendments. It is currently estimated that the RFA will be posted on the EPS by April 12, 2002. The RFA will state the actual deadline for the submission of competing Applications. There is no incumbent.****

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to extend the current Program Analysis and Control contract with QSS Group, Inc., for a period of three to six months and increase the cost value on a sole source basis, to provide continuation of services until a follow-on contract is in place. The authority for Other than Full and Open Competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  It is imperative that there be no disruption to performance-based services prior to the follow-on procurement becoming effective.  It would not be economical or feasible to compete a contract for the existing work to cover the proposed three to six month period until the anticipated start of the resultant contract under the follow-on competition, and would have negative impacts to ongoing missions and flight projects. In addtion, the combination of delay due to the competitive process and the time required by a new contractor to become acquainted with the work and systems (phase-in) would result in substantial adverse delays in fulfilling NASA's Mission.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See note 22.   Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 4, 2002. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed, See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NASA/SSC plans to issue a Best Value Request for Offer (RFO) for the project entitled Replace Diffuser/ Paint A2 Test Stand.  Contractor shall provide all tools, equipment, labor and transportation to clean and paint the A-2 Test Stand per specifications.  Contractor shall prepare the steel by water blasting (5000psi), while protecting test equipment; apply base coat and topcoat paint safely; and collect and filter effluent water. Special precautions are required due to presence of lead based paint.  Contractor shall also replace the A-2 diffuser with an existing Government furnished diffuser. The Contractor must protect surrounding equipment, closely integrate the schedule, and prove functionality to successfully complete this work. The maximum lift is approximately 35 tons, 50 ft long and 9 ft in diameter.  Contractor must submit a detailed plan of "How" they plan to install the diffuser as part of their offer. The painting base bid item must be substantially complete prior to replacement of the diffuser. Best Value Selection (BVS) seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit (including past performance, relevant experience and methodology) of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the Offerors and the Government.  BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the Offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts). However, the Government will consider awarding to an Offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.  Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an Offeror whose offer has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other offers warrant doing so. The order of magnitude for the procurement is $1,000,000 to $5,000,000, and the effort shall be completed within (120) calendar days after receipt of the notice to proceed.  This procurement is part of the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  As a result, all qualified responsible sources may submit a bid, which shall be considered by the agency. The NAICS Code and small business size standard for this procurement are 235210 and $12.0 million, respectively.  The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about April 10, 2002, with an anticipated bid closing date of on or about May 10, 2002. The firm date for receipt of bids or offers will be stated in the RFO.   An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".  Specifications and Drawings will only be made available on CDROM. Requests for copies shall be made by email to the Bid Distribution Office: jason.edge@ssc.nasa.gov or you may fax your request to (228) 688-1141.  The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement [with the exception of the specifications and drawings] will be available over the Internet. These documents will be in Microsoft Office 97 format and will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or  URL, for the NASA/SSC Business Opportunities page is: http://procurement.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=64 Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). A CDROM containing the specifications and drawings may be obtained from the Bid Distribution office; however, the closing date for the hard copy received shall be the same as the solicitation, inclusive of any amendments, released on the Internet.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Laboratory of Neurobiology (LN) plans to procure a TechnoTrade High Pressure Freezing Machine manufactured by (OEM) BAL-TEC AG of Blazers, Liechtenstein, Germany with TechnoTrade International, 7 Perimeter Road, Manchester, New Hampshire, 03103-3343.  The Laboratory of Neurobiology engages in fundamental research on the structural basis of synaptic transmission.  New advances make it possible to apply three dimensional image reconstruction techniques, tomography, to electron micrographs of neurons to understand the structure of the post synaptic apparatus.  However, the detail provided by tomography shows that conventional preparative techniques produce significant artifacts in the neurons.  High pressure freezing which rapidly freezes the specimen at extremely high pressures has been tested and found to prevent these artifacts.  Macromolecular structures in neurons are typically so small that they fall within the thickness of an EM section, and therefore are inaccessible for analysis.  The information exists in electron micrographs but overlap precludes analysis.  However, the new technique of tomography produces images at the molecular level.  These images have revealed to the laboratory that at the most detailed level tissues prepared with conventional cross-linking agents or slam freezing exhibit many structural dislocations.  High pressure freezing allows tissue to be prepared in which molecular organization is not disrupted.  High pressure freezing machine offered by TechnoTrade uniquely fits the needs of this program.  The most important element is the specimen holder.  Given the pressures needed 2100 Bar (similar to those in the breech of a rifle being fired) the design of the specimen state is difficult, expensive, and critical to success.  The HPM-010 holder, in particular, provides the necessary dimension to work with neural tissues 3 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm thick.  Furthermore the design of the specimen holder allows flexibility in the type of carrier stage used to hold the specimen, so cell suspensions, monolayers, cultures, and slices of whole tissues can be adapted to the specimen stage.  Neural tissues are also very sensitive to handling and anoxia so a specimen stage that can be loaded  and inserted into the freezing machine in less than twelve (12) seconds is required.  The HPM-010 High Pressure Freezing machine directs liquid nitrogen through three jets directly onto  the specimen holder at a pressure of 2100 Bar, producing cooling rates of 50 degrees Celsius/msec.  This operation reliably produces ice crystal free specimens in neural tissues up to 0,5 mm thick.  Instantaneous monitors on the specimen chamber record both pressure and freezing rates, providing a permanent documentation and verification of each successful experiment.  Introduction of the specimen carrier into the machine can be accomplished in seconds, facilitated by a quick action bolt.  The console is vibration and noise damped, and fully automated so new specimens can be introduced and frozen in ninety (90) seconds.  TechnoTrade International is the only source known to the NINDS Researcher that can provide a high pressure freezing machine of this nature.  The most critical feature of this machine, to make it possible to work on neural cells, require that the specimen chamber be able to accept specimens up to 3 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm thick.  Also, the holder should be able to be loaded in seconds and should accommodate a range of sizes and shapes especially adapted for particular types of neural tissue.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  The purpose of this request is to purchase a high pressure freezing machine to support the project on the macromolecular organization of the post synaptic density.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.   The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, (local Washington, D.C. time), on April 4, 2002.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted.  Faxed capability statements will not be accepted.  If submitting capability statements, provide one original and three copies.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) seeks to award a sole source (follow-on) contract to Morneau Sobeco to obtain the services required to modify the ARIEL software package, provide it for use by the PBGC, and assist PBGC in its initial production implementation. The intended contractor is the owner of the ARIEL software package and is the only authorized seller of the product.  Likewise, the intended contractor is the only firm with knowledge of the product sufficient to provide periodic technical and actuarial updates.  PBGC's application of ARIEL will require that the software be modified to accommodate calculations that are performed only by PBGC during the trusteeship processing of terminated pension plans.  These modifications will require a thorough understanding of the software package as well as an in-depth knowledge of actuarial principles and procedures as applied in the pension industry.  The intended firm is the only firm with the requisite understanding and knowledge of the ARIEL software package.  The intended contractor is the only firm with hands-on experience with the software package and will be the only firm with knowledge of the modifications made to meet PBGC requirements.  The period of performance is estimated to be for five years or more.  The proposed contract is for supplies and services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services, prepared in accordance in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This solicitation includes applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 01-05.  The acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items authorized in FAR 13.5.  The solicitation is set aside for small businesses.  The North American Industry Classification code is 421450, and the business size standard is 100 employees   The LMCB investigates basic cellular processes of homeostasis, growth, division and differentiation, with an emphasis on the molecular biology of chromosomes and the cell nucleus.  Research at the eukaryotic genome maintenance unit is aimed at understanding how living organisms safeguard their genomes against DNA damaging agents, such as irradiation.  The fruit-fly Drosophila is used as a model organism for these studies.  This particular X-ray machine will allow the laboratory to X-ray irradiate fruit flies at different developmental stages to induce cellular damages and to generate mutations.  The X-ray machine will generate DNA damages and facilitate a better understanding of how Drosophila cells detect and repair these damages.  The machine will also be used to induce mutations that cause defects in DNA damage repair.  These mutational studies help the laboratory to elucidate specific functions of genes involved in damage repair.  The required instrument shall have a shelfed chamber on which specimen would be placed.  The individual researcher must have control over the dosage of irradiation from 100 to 10,000 rads.  The machine must be able to deliver 10,000 rads for a period shorter than ten (10) minutes so that the specimen will not be dried during irradiation.  In addition, the instrument must be compact so that it can be placed in an easily accessible place.  The following minimum features are required for the Faxitron X-ray machine: 1)  >1000 Rad/min so that a dosage of 10,000 Rad can be delivered at less than ten (10) minutes.  This is critical for the experiments in two ways; (a) fruit flies will not be killed due to desiccation in the irrational chamber and, (b) fruit flies will still be at sleep which facilitates post-irradiation manipulation; 2) machine must be "self-cooling" so that no external source of coolant is needed; 3) radiation dosage can be very finely adjusted by changing the timer at one-second increments; 4) motor driven turntable which provides a means of improving uniformity of the absorbed radiation dose and; 5) machine is relatively small, allows easy placement in the laboratory and easy transportation.  EVALUATION:  One award is anticipated from this solicitation.  Offerors must propose on the entire requirement.  The technical quotation will receive paramount consideration in the selection of the Contractor for this acquisition.  All evaluations factors, other than price, when combined are significantly more important than price.  However, price will become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more Offerors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all technical factors.  The following technical evaluation criteria will be used by the Government when reviewing the technical portion of the quotation.  The criteria below are listed in order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes: 1) Ability to provide an X-Ray machine that can assist the NCI researcher in irradiation of fruit flies at different developmental stages to induce cellular DNA damage and to generate mutations (25 points); 2) The X-Ray machine should provide minimum specifications stated in the aforementioned synopsis of the required instrument (25 points); 3) Provide sufficient detail, warranties, and/or other documentation relevant to the proper operation of the instrument (25 points) and; 4) Ability to deliver, install X-Ray machine and train users within a reasonable time period (25 points).  MANDATORY INFORMATION:  Offers must be submitted on an SF1449.  Quotes must be accompanied by a completed "Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial -with Duns Number Addendum," signed by an authorized representative of the offeror.  In addition to the price quotation, Offerors must submit a technical quotation plus descriptive literature, warranties, and/or other material that demonstrate that their offer meets all of the foregoing basic and optional requirements.  This solicitation incorporates the provisions at FAR 52.212-1, INSTRUCTION TO OFFERORS-COMMERICAL ITEMS-DEVIATION FOR SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS and FAR 52.212-3, OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIOS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS, along with the DUNS NUMBER ADDENDUM.

<CONTACT>Patricia Haun, Purchasing Agent, Phone 301594-8855, Fax 301-480-4226, Email haunp@extra.niddk.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to purchase an Infinityplus 3rd RF Channel, 20-480 MHz from Varian Inc., 3120 Hansen Way, Palo Alto, CA 94304.  The technical specifications shall be included:  1) The channel must cover the frequency range from at least 28 Megahertz to 162 Megahertz, corresponding to NMR frequencies of nitrogen-14 and phosphorus-31 nuclei.  2) The pulse programmer for this channel must permit the application of pulse sequences of significant complexity (at least 1024 pulse sequence steps), including conditional execution of pulse sequence blocks, nested loopoing with at least ten different loop counters, independent phase cycling or phase incrementation of all radio frequency pulses and amplitude modulation of individual pulses.  This pulse programmer should be identical to the pulse programmers for the existing channels.  3) Shall be able to trigger radio frequency pulses on the third channel explicitly and actively from an external logic signal, for example, from a sample spinning speed tachometer in order to synchronize pulse sequences with sample spinning. This external triggering capability is absolutely essential for many experiments to be performed with the new spectrometer console, and must be absolutely reliable with no jitter or instability in synchronization above 100 nanoseconds.  4) The channel must include digital phase-shifting in increments of 0.35 degrees (10 bits) or less.  Small-angle and large angle phase shifts must occur in less than 100 nanoseconds (to 90% of desired phase change) from the time at which the phase shift is requested by the pulse program.  There should be no software or hardware delays that limit phase switching times to more than 100 nanoseconds.  Inaccuracies in phase shifts must be less than 0.1 degrees.  For a fixed amplitude setting in the pulse program, the pulse amplitude must be independent of phase without any requirement for manual adjustment or calibration by the user.  5) Amplitude modulation of radio frequency pulses must be possible on the channel, with arbitrary shape specified in the pulse program, over an amplitude range of at least 60 dB.  Amplitude switching by 20 dB must occur in less than 100 nanoseconds (to 90% of desired amplitude change) from the time at which the amplitude change is requested by the pulse program.  6) Apply pulse sequences asynchronously from the other two existing channels, for example, as in heteronuclear pulse decoupling or TPPM decoupling experiments.  It must be possible to program the spectrometer so that the timing of pulses and delays on the third channel is not dependent on the timing of pulses and delays on the other two channels, so that pulse lengths and delay lengths can be set arbitrarily and independently on the third channel.  7) Must be compatible with the Varian Infinity Plus NMR Spectrometer.  The Institutes intends to purchase this equipment by other than full and open competition from Varian Inc.  To the best of the Government's knowledge they are the sole manufacturer and distributor of this equipment.  Interested vendors may identify, in writing, their interest with a capability statement to the Contracting Officer prior to the closing date of this notice.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all responses received before, the closing date of this announcement, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  It is anticipated that Request for Quotation (RFQ) NIH-NIDDK-02-735 will be available fifteen (15) days after the publication date of this synopsis.  Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10 days after the release of the RFQ.  The anticipated award date is April 30, 2002.  Request for copies of the RFQ must be in writing and may be FAXED to 301-480-4226.  Quotations must be submitted in writing to the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases 6707 Democracy Blvd., Room 774C, Bethesda, Maryland 20817 Attention:  Patricia Haun.  FAX quotations must contain offerors names, address, telephone number and fax number.  FAX quotations will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

BACKGROUND

The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS/BPH) provides braille books and talking books for approximately 700,000 eligible patrons of the service nationwide.  To serve its readers, NLS/BPH produces about 2,000 braille and talking books titles annually.  In addition NLS/BPH acquires approximately 500 braille and talking books per year from outside sources to supplement its own production of books.  These 500 titles are acquired from a number of different sources, mostly from abroad.  They are in a variety of languages and require processing into a Special Foreign Library Collection.

<SOLNBR>NDK-RFI-01
<RESPDATE>040102
<ARCHDATE>10012002
<CONTACT>Mr. Timothy M. Frank; 781.377.2999
<DESC>This is not a solicitation, but for planning purposes only.  The Minuteman Minimum Essential Emergency Communication Network (MEECN) Program (MMP) was designed to provide the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Launch Control Centers (LCCs) with an Extremely High Frequency (EHF) and Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) survivable communication system.  The United States Air Force requests information and is searching for industry sources for the manufacturing, deployment, and support of 52 MMP operational units, 33 training units, and 3 maintenance test sets.   The MMP system will provide an EHF satellite and VLF/LF communication capability for the Minuteman (MM) ICBM LCCs.  The Air Force will consider any or all of the following scenarios: 1)  An integrated EHF and VLF/LF MMP system;  2)  An independent contractor for the VLF/LF portion and an independent contractor for the EHF portion of the system with one of the contractors taking the lead integration role; 3)  An independent contractor for the VLF/LF, an independent contractor for the EHF and an independent contractor as the MMP system integrator.  The LCCs require these systems to add alternate and timelier means of receiving Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) using the EHF and VLF/LF spectrum and to provide an ensured Reportback capability using EHF.  MMP full-scale production receivers must meet the requirements of the MMP Operational Requirements Documents (ORDs) contained in a data package available on request, or electronically on the Hanscom Electronic RFP Bulletin Board (HERBB) and summarized as follows:  1) Interoperability with the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) EHF-EAM network including AF Reportback protocols and KGV-11 net compatibility for EAM reception using the applicable networks described in the Milstar Allocation Report (MAR); 2) Interoperability with the JCS VLF/LF network processing EAP-CJCS Volume VII Emergency Action Procedures(EAPs) using the following MEECN Modes: 15, 9 MEECN Processing Mode (MMPM), and HIDAR; 3) Probability of Correct Message Receipt (PCMR) of at least 90% for the independent VLF/LF and EHF paths (objective 99%) with a combined PCMR of 99% over both paths; 4) Integration into the already existing Weapon System Control Console (WSCC) Higher Authority Communications/Rapid Message Processing Element (HAC/RMPE) processor used at the LCCs to provide one integrated operator interface for all LCC systems; 5) Capability to be controlled with minimum operator involvement and while strapped into an LCC chair; and 6) The VLF/LF path must be survivable to operate throughout the ICBM Weapon System Nuclear Survivabilty Requirements. The System Program Office (SPO) envisions procuring the systems using 1) little/no engineering development funding, 2) Cost As an Independent Variable (CAIV) and Best Value to obtain an affordable system that meets the performance need of the Air Force Space Command user; 3) an innovative design centered around maximum reuse of ICBM qualified and available VLF/LF and EHF equipment and technology to reduce program risk and cost for achieving operational and the Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) requirements; and 4) efficient and timely internal and external manufacturing, deployment, and support capabilities to ensure maximum benefit for the Air Force. Past performance will be an indicator of ability to perform.  Contractors who believe they can meet these requirements should submit a qualification package, not exceeding 10 pages to the address listed below.  This package must describe the prospective offeror=92s: 1) proposed architecture for an integrated EHF/VLF/LF solution and/or the independent solutions detailed above, that requires little, to no development effort; 2) manufacturing, deployment, and support capabilities, 3) detailed schedules that demonstrate the ability and date to deliver a full operational capability.  The Government will not reimburse contractors for any cost associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice and is not obligated to return the prospectus or respond to comments.  This is not a solicitation.  The Air Force will use the information for planning purposes only.  A contract will not be awarded from this announcement.  This Sources Sought may be followed by a formal conference on a yet to be determined date at Hanscom AFB, MA.  The Government maintains a web site with additional information at http://www.herbb.hanscom.af.mil under Business Opportunities for Systems at Hanscom.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call Colonel J.P. Maryeski at (781) 377-5106.   For technical questions, contact Capt Brad Walker, ESC/NDM, 11 Eglin Street Bldg 1618, Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2120, phone (781) 377-5958 or fax (781) 377-8553, or via email at bradley.walker@hanscom.af.mil .

Within the Phoenix Area IHS are nine hospitals, the largest of which is the Phoenix Indian Medical Center.  Patients are referred there for specialized care not available at the eight reservation hospitals.  The Phoenix Area IHS Division of Facilities Engineering, wishes to install Computerized Maintenance Management  (CMMS) software at the 5 largest installations.   The General Services Administration is exploring the options for the purchase, installation, and support of a complete and operational CMMS at the Hopi Healthcare Center, Keams Canyon, Arizona.  Based upon the successful demonstration at the Hopi Healthcare Center, the IHS may select one or all of the following 4 sites within Arizona (Whiteriver Hospital, San Carlos Hospital, Parker Hospital, Phoenix Indian Medical Center) for CMMS implementation.   The software proposed for the CMMS must meet the following functional requirements:  1) Easy to use, 2) Generate work requests and work orders, 3) Allow network/web based service requests, 4) Generate automatic Preventive Maintenance (PM) work orders, 5) Maintain equipment repair histories, 6) Keep track of work instruction and repair procedures for each piece of equipment 7) Include a database of generic work instructions and repair procedures for facility and equipment maintenance, 8) Stand-alone and Network versions of the CMMS software must be available 9) Built in maintenance reports, including open/closed work orders and work completed during a given cycle, 10) Microsoft Office compatible reports, 11) Custom reports, 12) Compatible with MS Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000 or Windows NT, 13) Compatible with Pentium III 600 MHz with 128 MB of RAM when run on a stand-alone computer or on a network server. 14)  For those computers used to submit work requests by the hospital staff, the program must be compatible with computers that are Pentium 133 MHz, or higher CPU, with 32 MB of RAM. Questions:  1) Does your firm have a software package that meets all of the technical requirements noted above?  If so, please provide us with technical information on your firm's software package. 2) Can your firm provide the on-site support required for initial set-up, data entry and training?

<DESC>The U. S. Postal Service desires to pre-qualify potential sources based on ability to provide products and services associated with stationery products for resale within postal retail locations.  While potential suppliers must pre-qualify for all required services, the USPS encourages the use of partnering or subcontracting arrangements given performance accountability, quality and specific value-added contributions can be assured. The USPS intends to award one contract as a result of the solicitation.  The best overall value obtained from the performance arrangements proposed by pre-qualified suppliers will determine the resulting contract award.  It should be noted the USPS will not split awards based on the different services required.  The supplier must be able to perform all the services using its own resources or through subcontracting arrangements to present a complete solution.  The USPS plans to introduce a consistent, standarized range of premium quality retail stationery products with a unique brand image in its retail locations.  The purpose of the plan is to provide added convenience to USPS customers while lowering operating costs and generating incremental revenue.  The USPS is looking for a partner firm that demonstrates exceptional capabilities with regard to product and creative development, distribution and inventory management, and retail account relationship management.  Only those suppliers who wish to be prime contractor, capable of offering a completion solution, need respond to this announcement.  Competition will be limited to EDI-capable trading partners.  Suppliers interested in pre-qualifying for this item may request a Pre-qualification package via fax, Attn:  Kathleen Burt @ (215) 931-5154, or email requests to kburt1@email.usps.gov.  The deadline for receipt of requests of the Pre-qualification package is April 3, 2002, 4:00 PM EST.  Only suppliers that submit pre-qualification packages in accordance with this notice may be eligible for participation in the solicitation.  Not all qualified suppliers responding to this announcement will necessarily be placed on the pre-qualified list.  The pre-qualified list may be limited to those suppliers considered most qualified to meet the Postal Service's requirements or to a smaller list that will provide adequate competition.  Competition will be limited solely to pre-qualified suppliers.  Suppliers will be notified whether or not they are selected for the pre-qualification list.  Suppliers who are not selected will be provided the rationale for non-selection so they may better prepare for future pre-qualification requirements.

<DESC>The Postal Service is seeking sources to form a long-term relationship (possible for as long as ten years) for providing On-Site Mobile Fueling/Wet Hosing Service.  At this time, our efforts will be focused only in the Southeast Area states of AL, MS, GA, FL, and TN, with a potential of future expansion.  The Southeast Area maintains a fleet in excess of 23,683 vehicles.  These vehicles range from passenger cars to tractor trailers with the majority being light delivery vehicles.  The Postal Service intends to pre-qualify suppliers that meet the qualifications, financial capability, experience and past performance as stated below.  Interested suppliers who have current resources in the Southeast states listed above must respond, in writing, to this request.  Response packages must include specific details to sufficiently address the competencies listed below which will be used in determining qualifications among responses received:

(1) Supplier Coverage - The supplier must be able to deliver and dispense into individual motor vehicles, located at designated sites, the following types of fuel requirements: Regular unleaded gasoline (minimum 87 octane) and/or No. 2 low sulfur diesel.  Supplier must have ability to expand into the alternate fuel market as the Postal Service needs arise.  The current alternative fuels being used by the USPS are:  bio-diesel (B20) and ethanol.(E85)  
(2) Program Management and Service Capability - Suppliers must include information outlining their proposed contract management structure.  A narrative description of the proposed quality control of services, including procedures to avoid cross contamination of fuels, environmental protection actions in case of spills, materials provided and timeliness of service, including a description of their service network must be provided as a minimum.  Suppliers must provide information demonstrating that the company has the necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls and technical skills to provide the services being requested.  
(3) Current and Past Performance -The supplier must provide information and references that will document a record of satisfactory performance on contracts of similar magnitude.  Satisfactory performance as defined by the Postal Service is: (1) quality of service; (2) timeliness of performance; and (3) customer satisfaction.  Suppliers must provide proof of timeliness of performance (adherence to contract schedules, including administrative aspects of performance).  Suppliers must be able to prove good customer relations (a history of being reasonable and cooperative with customers, commitment to customer satisfaction, integrity, ethics and environmental compliance).  
(4) Data Warehousing - Suppliers must be able to maintain individual service records on each USPS vehicle serviced.  These records must be accessible to the facility being serviced.  Suppliers must furnish detailed narratives of all data resources which they propose to make available to the Postal Service.  This narrative must include as a minumum:  (1) System flexibility, (i.e. ability to easily access data and customize reports);  (2) Standard reports (i.e. what reports does the system currently generate); and (3) System reliability, (i.e. number of hours of system downtime within past 12 months). 
 
(5) Financial Responsibility - Suppliers must provide adequate information to demonstrate their financial capability, including if the company has the necessary working capital and/or resources to perform the contract (or how they will obtain it if the successful contractor).  Evidence of financial stability as evidenced by the supplier's credit history will be one aspect of the evaluation.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) anticipates award of a Firm-Fixed Price Design/Build contract with award fees for the design and construction of a medium security Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) to be located in Pollock, Louisiana.  The scope of work includes all architectural, engineering, construction, and other related services necessary to provide the new federal correctional facility.  The proposed institution is currently planned to consist of a group of buildings in a campus plan arrangement with related site development and site utilities.  The FCI will have a gross building area of approximately 56,000 square meters and be designed to house approximately 1,100 inmates.  The Design-Build Base contract award will be for design and schedule development services, and is anticipated for approximately late Summer of 2002.  The option for major construction is anticipated in late Fall 2002 and subject to funding availability for fiscal year 2003.   The estimated magnitude of this project is expected to exceed $75,000,000.  For consideration on this project, the offeror, at a minimum, must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, in successfully and satisfactorily completing a project of similar size and scope.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.  For the design member of the design-build team, the Architect/Engineer firm or the principal or lead A/E firm of a joint venture, must have an existing active office, which will have responsibility for the plans and specifications, located within the State of Louisiana.  The design of the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, life safety, security electronics or other engineering features of the project shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by architects and engineers registered in the State of Louisiana to practice in the particular professional field involved.  Participation by architects, engineers, consultants, suppliers and subcontractors located within the State of Louisiana is encouraged.  Participation by small, small-disadvantaged, HUBZone small businesses, small woman-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses is also encouraged.   The successful offeror will be required to submit a subcontracting plan for this procurement regarding the utilization of small, small-disadvantaged, small woman-owned businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  The FBOP will be utilizing two-phase Design-Build selection procedures.  The Phase One solicitation will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration?s Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the Phase One solicitation document will not be available.  The web site provides downloading instructions.  All future information regarding this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  Phase One solicitations will be issued on or about April 12, 2002.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One solicitation.

The Air Force and Coast Guard use the MK 25 mod 3 and the Navy uses the mod 4. The marker is launched from aircraft in either day or night to mark the course of enemy submarines in antisubmarine warfare operations. Markers maybe launched from high-speed aircraft or helicopters. They can be  used for any type of air to sea surface marking that are referenced by smoke and flame.  A marker consists of an aluminum body, approximately 19.0 inches long and 3.0 inches in diameter, containing a 744-gram pyrotechnic candle, starter composition, elect ric match, and salt water activated battery.  The battery is located in the base and is shielded from water contact. There is a safe arming device in the base. Salt water enters the battery cavity and serves as an electrolyte causing the battery to produce  current, which activates the electric match igniting the starter composition, which ignites the red phosphorus candle. Gas pressure forces the valve assembly from the chimney in the nose and yellow flame and white smoke emitted.  Burning time ranges from 13.5 to 18.5 minutes. The differences in the mod 3 and mod 4 vary mostly in the configuration of the protective covering of the battery cavity and safe arm device. The mod 4 uses a plastic cover that is removed before launch allows water to enter the batte ry cavity. The mod 3 features an integral aluminum cover and an arrow indicator placed in the safe/arm position. Water enters the battery cavity through two holes by depressing the plugs before launch.   The mod 4 configuration features a pyrotechnic scutt le element and three 0.013-inch diameter flood holes to ensure that the marker will scuttle and sink within 3 to 12 hours after water impact, or 1 to 3 hours after ignition.  All markers intend to be used in salt water but can be adapted for use in fresh w ater by adding a small amount of table salt in the base area where water enters the battery cavity. The Navy is the design agency for these markers.  A technical data package is available for review but the Navy intends to develop a form, fit and function technical data package for the fiscal year 2003 requirements.  Projected procurement quantities are approximately 3,500 per year and expected to increase substantially.  Interested companies may propose using commercially available or a modified commercially available marker provided they meet the requirements of the performance specification. Also include a description of company capabilities and qualifications to HQ OSC,  ATTN: AMSOS-PRB, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, IL 61299-6000. Request that companies interested producing the MLMs respond to the sources sought no later than 30 April 2002 and identify “Marine Location Marker Sources Sought/Market Research” as the subject of yo ur response.

The RF Sensors Division continues to develop advanced capabilities to reduce the cost of transitioning technology into the Fleet.

III. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST.  This BAA is to solicit technical/cost proposals for research support in technologies that are applicable to Radio Frequency (RF) Sensor systems for Navy Aircraft. Major areas of interest include  (1) Signal Processing, (2) Antennas and Propagation, (3) Information Processing, (4) Devices and Materials, (5) Radar and RF Communications Systems Engineering Methodologies, and (6) Aircraft Installation Technologies. New, innovative and creative approaches to technical problems that significantly advance radar and RF Communication system performance and improve aircraft installations are sought. Among the primary interest areas are AEW radar operating at UHF through L band and S-band, tactical radar operating at C, X, and Ku bands, synthetic aperture radar operating in X-, C-, L-, and UHF-bands, and C3I systems operating at any radio frequency throughout the spectrum. Examples of technologies include, but are not limited to, antennas, antenna array concepts, electronically scanned arrays, conformal arrays, radomes, propagation, scattering, and diffraction, rough surface scattering, computational electromagnetics (with emphasis on antenna design and antenna-platform interaction), phased array antenna concepts, electronically scanned arrays, devices and materials, remote sensor telemetry and miniaturized RF telecommunication transceivers, optical components/fiber  optics, photonics and monolithic microwave integrated circuits,  high power broadband T/R modules and associated subassembly/device  technologies, direct digital synthesis exciter concepts, space-time  adaptive processing (STAP) techniques for circular arrays,  massively parallel processing architectures for multi-channel  STAP, software engineering, advanced signal processing of synthetic  aperture radar data, advanced image processing, data and image exploitation, moving target imaging techniques, automatic  target recognition and classification, advanced signal  processing concepts for multi-mode sensor operation, and equipment installation techniques solutions. 

IV. CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE. NAWCAD is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions).  Other Transactions will be entered into under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371 (Congressional direction requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of a project under this initiative be provided by industry) and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects.  Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/other trans.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research, or by contacting Ben Hansford at (301) 342-5738 or by e-mail at hansfordbj@navair.navy.mil.  Final decision on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government.

NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project.  Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal).  In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.

B.	PHASE II ? Full Proposal

General Information:  Only Offerors whose Phase I - White Paper is considered capable of meeting Program requirements will be asked to submit Phase II - Full Proposals. REQUEST FOR SUBMISSION OF A FULL PROPOSAL DOES NOT GUARANTEE AWARD SELECTION. Proposals shall be submitted in original, with the signature of an authorizing official, with three (3) copies to the address noted above. Proposal submission is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and small, HUBZone small disadvantaged, and women owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.  Submit Full Proposals in two (2) volumes; 

VOLUME I ? TECHNICAL PROPOSAL, not to exceed twenty-five (25) pages, should include the following three sections: Section 1 - Executive Summary: Provide a brief technical and business description of the contents of the proposal. The technical area should address the proposal's technical goals, approach, and expected results. The business area should address business and/or commercial applications of the proposal technology. Section 2 - Technical Issues: Detail the technical approach, objectives, staffing and resources relating to the development of the proposed technology for military and commercial (if applicable) use; discuss specifically in realistic terms the technical objectives of this proposed effort; provide a Statement of Work (SOW) that discusses the specific tasks to be accomplished, tied to the specific approach and goals of the project; provide resumes for Principle Investigator(s) and other key research personnel; describe the current and planned facilities and equipment to accomplish the research objectives; and, give a description of past performance on similar efforts. Section 3 - Business Issues: Discuss the business issues relating to the commercial applications of the proposed development and its impact on the market; detail benefits to the Department of Defense (DoD).

VOLUME II - COST/FUNDING PROPOSAL. Cost/funding proposals are not restricted in length, have no specific page layout requirements, and should address funding periods of performance.  Formal work breakdown structures and certified cost or pricing data are neither required nor desired, however, NAVAIR reserves the right the request this information for proposals using FAR/DFARS type contracts. Organize Cost/Funding proposals to include four (4) sections in the following order: 

Section 1 - Total Project Cost: This section will give a detailed breakdown of costs of 
the project. Cost should also be broken for each task appearing in the Statement of Work and should include all of the proposed costs to the Government and cost shared by the offeror. Present the following information for each phase of the effort: total cost of the particular project phase; total offeror cost share (mandatory for certain "other transaction agreements" see above); funding requested from the Government; and elements of cost (labor, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, and cost of money). Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, equipment purchases, fair market rental value of leased items, and the method used for making such valuations. Profit should not be included as a cost element if the contract type to be awarded will be cost sharing. 
Section 2 - Cost Sharing and In-Kind Contributions: This section will include: (i) the sources of cash and amounts to be used for matching requirements; (ii) the specific in-kind contributions proposed, their value in monetary terms, and the methods by which their values were derived; and (iii) evidence of the existence of adequate cash or commitments to provide sufficient cash in the future. Affirmative, signed statements are required from outside sources of cash. Provide sufficient information regarding the sources of the offerors? cost share so that a determination may be made by the Government regarding the availability, timeliness, and control of these resources. For example: How will the funds and resources be applied to advance the progress of the proposed effort? What is the role of any proposed in-kind contributions? 
Section 3 - Cost to the Government: This section will specify the total costs proposed to be borne by the Government and any technical or other assistance including equipment, facilities, and personnel of Federal laboratories, if any, required to support these activities. The cost to the Government should be that portion of the proposed effort, which is not covered, by the contractor's portion of the cost share. The costs incurred and work performed by any DoD or national laboratory "partnering" with the offeror under the proposal shall normally be considered costs of the Government and not costs of the offeror for purposes of the cost-sharing requirement.  The offeror shall present sufficient information regarding the resources to be provided by the Government so that an evaluation of their availability, timeliness, and control may be made. 
Section 4 - Off-Budget Supporting Resources: This section will show cash or in-kind resources which will support the proposed activity but which are not intended to be included in the total project cost. Items in this category do not count as cost share or as Federal funds, which must be matched. Examples of items to place in this category include: Commitments of cash or in-kind resources from other Federal sources, such as national laboratories, and projections of fee-based income where there is substantial uncertainty about the level which will actually be collected and where the income is not needed to meet cost-share requirements. 


VI. EVALUATION CRITERIA. The government will evaluate proposals responsive to any or all of the areas of interest discussed herein. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since each is a unique technology with no common work statement.  The merit of the proposal shall be determined based on the following criteria listed in order of importance: 

(1) The Offeror's ability to demonstrate feasibility and potential contributions of the effort to DOD priorities in RF Sensor related technologies; 

(2) Overall scientific and technical merits of the proposal; 

(3) The Offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques or unique combinations of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives; 

(4) Proposed cost, adjusted for cost realism;

<SUBJECT>A -- BAA for Producibility and Manufacturing
<DESC>The mission of the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is to develop an integrated ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) to defend US deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attack.  As part of that effort, MDA will develop and test new technologies to provide early capability, modify and improve on existing technologies (commercial and dual-use) for insertion into BMDS Elements, and improve the effectiveness of deployed capabilities to counter new threats.  To investigate these technologies and technology insertion opportunities, MDA has established a Producibility and Manufacturing (MP)Deputate whose mission is to identify technology insertion candidates and open/modular systems applications that enhance producibility, quality and/or reliability, lower cost and reduce risk for all BMDS elements.  The MDA/MP seeks new and innovative concepts for improving the producibility, quality and reliability of:  (1) Radar Systems - Antennas, Transmit/Receive Modules, Signal Processing, Optical Signal Processing, Thermal Management, RF Seekers; (2) Electro-Optical Systems - Passive IR and Optical Systems, Ladar, Focal Plane Arrays, High Energy Lasers, Beam Control; (3) Propulsion - Booster, Divert and Attitude Control Systems (DACS); (4) Materials Science - Composite Structures, Thermal Management Materials, IR Windows; (5) Electronics - Wide Band Gap Materials and Devices, Radiation Hardened/Tolerant Electronics, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), Data Links; (6) Power Systems - Batteries; (7) Software - application of COTS products to signal processing, middleware, operating systems, simulations and networking.  MDA/MP plans a budget for work under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) of $6 million for fiscal year '02 and $22 million for fiscal year '03.  However, these budgeted amounts are subject to change.  As a planning estimate, the awards are to be in the range of $1 million to $5 million for multi-year projects.  If you are interested in this opportunity, please respond to MDA with the following:  (1) a summary white paper (not to exceed five pages) which succinctly illustrates the research objectives, technical approach, and potential relevance to MDA Program; (2) a Rough Order of Cost Magnitude (ROCM); (3) a suggested period of performance, and (4) principal investigator capabilities, relevant experience, and available facilities.  Responses shall be submitted in electronic format (MS Word for Windows or a clearly readable .pdf file) to the point of contact listed below.  No oral presentations by potential offerors concerning this solicitation are permitted except as authorized by the Contracting Officer.  The MDA will evaluate these responses based upon (in declining order of importance):  (1) the relevance of the technology or application to the MDA program; (2) the ability to develop and/or demonstrate technologies with near term applications to MDA needs; (3) the offer's capabilities, relevant experience, and facilities; and (4) estimated cost.  (The MDA intends to make awards on the basis of a balanced assessment of technical merit and estimated cost.)  This BAA will remain open until September 30, 2003.  Responses will be evaluated as received, but may take up to six months to complete.  If MDA decides to pursue a concept, a formal proposal will be requested.  The MDA may award contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions as a result of this BAA.  Awards are anticipated to occur in late FY 2002 through FY 2004.  Issuance of this BAA does not obligate the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.  The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received.  Please direct any questions you may have to Ms. Sherri Nosar at (703) 695-9107 or e-mail at sherri.nosar@mda.osd.mil.
