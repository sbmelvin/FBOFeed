MEMORANDUM FOR 42 CONS/LGCB-2
                                  ATTN:  CHARLIE H. FOSTER, JR.

FROM:  CCAF/CC
	 130 W. Maxwell Blvd
	 Maxwell AFB AL 36112

SUBJECT:  Sole Source Justification, Purchase Request # F2XHC78101AQ01
            								                 
1.  Description of the supplies and services being acquired:  The purpose of this acquisition is for the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) to continue to license and use the Singularity transcript processing system and obtain technical support for the system.  
 
2.  Justification for Sole Source:  CCAF, under contract numbers FA3300-06-P-0214 and FA3300-07-P-0188, has been using Hershey Business Systems Inc. (HBSI) as the prime contractor to develop the web-enabled, enterprise-wide transcript processing and access management system known as Singularity.  HBSI is the sole provider of this software and is the only known source that can fill the unique licensing and maintenance requirements of this system in a cost effective, timely manner.  The software is developed by HBSI and they maintain proprietary data rights.  CCAF will continue to closely monitor ongoing advancements and design innovations in the commercial computer software industry, and will actively solicit input from additional contractors in the future to assure full and open competition is available on all future acquisitions of this type.  This software must be licensed annually and maintained through software updates, patches and additional capabilities.  This effort requires the contractor to have considerable knowledge of CCAF’s Student Transcript, Administration and Record System (STARS), remote Education Services Offices access processes, and the integration and delivery of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) 130 transaction files from the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO) EDI server located on the University of Texas campus.  Over the past few years, HBSI acquired a thorough understanding of CCAF’s business processes and developed system specifications to enhance the tracking of scanned and electronically received transcript information into CCAF’s STARS system.  HBSI has also worked with CCAF technical personnel to deliver out-bound sorting of transcript data from STARS and formatting electronic transcripts to conform to the 130 transaction set used by the AACRAO EDI server.  HBSI has developed this expertise over the last 8 years by working with major higher education institutions similar to CCAF.  Throughout this period, HBSI has developed a web-based framework that is compliant with a variety of products and services that enhance student success, credit transfer and records retention.

3.  Justification that source is the only known source:  It has been determined that no other contractor who specializes in similar projects could accomplish the deployment and/or support the application.  In addition, the current developed software codes and comprehensive understanding of CCAF internal business processes, along with the expertise of the external EDI transactions, support the fact that no other contractor could adequately support the current application and future enhancements.

4.  Actions taken to preclude future sole source applications:  No action can be taken to preclude future sole source acquisitions under the current conditions (proprietary ownership of Singularity Imaging System and Software).

Electronic submissions will also be accepted.  

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:  (a) Ability to Meet Program Milestones and Proposed Schedule - The white paper/proposal establishes a clear and reasonable schedule with well-defined research milestones to be used as exit and entry criteria for government approval to progress through phases of the proposed effort.  The feasibility and likelihood of the proposed approach for satisfying the program milestones are explicitly described and clearly substantiated.  The white paper/proposal reflects a mature and quantitative understanding of the proposed milestones, the statistical confidence with which they may be measured, and their relationship to the concept of operations that will result from successful performance.  NOTE:  This criterion will not be used to evaluate single phase/short duration (12 months or less) efforts, unless the Government requests research milestones be provided in the request for proposal; (b) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - The proposed technical approach is feasible, achievable and.  Task descriptions and associated technical elements provided are complete and in a logical sequence with all proposed deliverables clearly defined such that a final product that achieves the goal can be expected as a result of award.  The white paper/proposal identifies major technical risks and planned mitigation efforts are clearly defined and feasible; (c) Potential Contribution and Relevance to the AFRL Mission - The potential contributions of the proposed effort with relevance to the national technology base will be evaluated.  Specifically, AFRL’s mission is to maintain the technological superiority of the U.S. Air Force and prevent technological surprise from harming our national security by sponsoring revolutionary, high-payoff research that bridges the gap between fundamental discoveries and their military use; (d) Offeror’s Capabilities and/or Related Experience - The offeror's prior experience in similar efforts must clearly demonstrate an ability to deliver products that meet the proposed technical performance within the proposed budget and schedule.  The proposed team’s expertise to manage the cost and schedule will be evaluated.  Similar efforts completed/ongoing by the offeror in this area are fully described including identification of other Government sponsors; (e) Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition -  The capability to transition the technology to the research, industrial, and operational military communities in such a way as to enhance U.S. defense, and the extent to which intellectual property rights limitations creates or may create a barrier to technology transition; and (f) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).  

No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:

    Capt Wesley Gilley
    Telephone:  (315) -291-2901

<CONTACT>Kristina J Croake, Contracting Officer, Phone (937) 255-3427, Email kristina.croake@wpafb.af.mil - Jacob L. Hinchman, Government Program Engineer, Phone (937) 255-6127 x4154, Email Jacob.Hinchman@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC><p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Air Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/RBCC), intends to upgrade currently owned and procure two additional Northrop Grumman Corporation, Electronic Systems, Navigation Systems Division (NGC ES NSD) LN-251 navigation systems to meet the Automated Aerial Refueling (AAR) Phase II Program performance specification, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii).
<p>The LN-251s include the following modifications which are required for the AAR Phase II Program:<br />1. Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System (GPS/INS) coupling for improved GPS tracking<br />2. Relative Navigation (RELNAV) algorithms which enable real-time relative position accuracies that have been verified through flight test with tanker tail blockage. Note: It is necessary that the system be verified through flight test given the unique nature of GPS errors from tanker-created sky blockage.<br />3. Timing interface for Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT) radios<br />4. AAR specific Redundancy Interface <br />5. Ethernet Interface</p>
<p>NGC will produce and upgrade seven LN-251s with the AAR-specific modifications completed by October 2009. Additional product improvements will be continued through FY12. The procurement would include the integration of the NGC RelNav algorithms into the LN-251s, improvements in the LN-251s' GPS tracking, the capability to operate in an AAR relevant redundant architecture, and overall modifications for compliance with the AAR Phase II architecture.</p>
<p>The current state of the AAR LN-251 RelNav system is a result of 30 months of algorithm development, including extensive ground and flight test. Additionally, in the past six months, hardware modifications have been designed to ease the transition of the developmental system to a production-type system. The LN-251 system is also coupled with uniquely modified GPS receiver cards from Rockwell Collins which enable tracking of GPS signals. Furthermore, the technology is interlinked with the TTNT datalink hardware and performance developed by Rockwell Collins. NGC has 72 months of knowledge base associated with Rockwell Collins, assuring system design and integration compatibility. Additionally, the LN-251 is a commercial production line from NGC ES NSD. NGC has limited rights on the specifications, design, architecture, and implementation of the baseline LN-251.</p>
<p>This notice is for informational purposes only. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). Contractors capable of offering this capability must respond within 15 days after publication of this notice by submitting a specific capability statement to provide this capability. Contractors must provide information, including flight test results, to substantiate capability of providing an AAR specific PGPS system which has been demonstrated in flight tests with tanker blockage using military Precise Positioning Service (PPS) equipment. These conditions make the needed PGPS system uniquely different from other precision differential systems, including landing systems including but not limited to the Navy's Sea Based-Joint Precision And Landing System (SB-JPALS). <br /><br />All responses received within 15 days after publication of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Only capability statements submitted under this Notice of Contracting Action, NOCA-PKV-08-08, will be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.</p>

<DESC>FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) NAVIGATION SERVICES SUPPORTMARKET SURVEY
*******************ATTENTION ALL RESPONDENTS************************
The FAA is seeking additional information to help determine if industry can fulfill this requirement. Please note an additional section (4. Information to include in Survey Response) has been incorporated. Please be advised that the interested parties list published on May 13, 2008 will be updated and released accordingly. 
All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead.  No type font less than 12 point may be used.  Responses must be received no later than 3:00 PM Eastern Day Light Savings Time 15 days after publication of this announcement. Vendors who responded to the previous announcement must update their submission for future consideration. 

1. PURPOSE:
This announcement is a Market Survey.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) or REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Further, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA is conducting market research, via this market survey, to determine the capabilities and interest of vendors to fulfill a requirement of the Navigation Services Directorate for professional services.  These services cover such areas as engineering support, logistics, training, operations research and analysis, requirements development and analysis, business and material management.  Examples include technical support services to assist in the planning, research, development, engineering, implementation, sustainment, and decommissioning of various navigation, landing and lighting systems.  Interested vendors are also encouraged to submit feedback regarding the attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW).
At this time, the nature of this competition has not been determined.  In accordance with paragraph 3.2.1.2.1 of the FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS), this market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition would exist if this acquisition were set aside for small business.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for these efforts are 541330, 541511, 541611, 541614, 561110, and 541990.  Interested firms are asked to submit the attached Business Declaration form.
Attachment A is the Draft Statement of Work (SOW).  This Draft SOW represents all anticipated contractor support requirements.  Interested vendors are requested to comment on the range of services scope.  Also, provide company size, capabilities, and previous experience in providing similar services.
All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with any response to this Market Survey announcement.   Therefore, any costs associated with this Market Survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense.
Failure of a sufficient number of adequately qualified firms to respond to this survey may result in a competitive procurement open to all businesses, instead of being a small business set aside.  Any information provided under this request for comments is for informational purposes only and will not be released to the public.  Any proprietary information submitted must be adequately marked as proprietary and will be protected if appropriately marked. 
2. SUBCONTRACTING/TEAMING OPPORTUNITIES

Please be advised, this list will contain company names, addresses, points of contact, telephone numbers, and email address of vendors responding to this survey and they may be contacted by other interested parties. The purpose of the list is to facilitate and encourage small business to seek subcontracting opportunities with potential FAA contractors.  The FAA is not in any way endorsing or recommending any company on the list.  This list is no guarantee that the vendor will be notified of any information that will be posted on the FAA Contract opportunities web page.  To add your company to the list please contact Don B.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED WORK:  The Government is seeking a qualified contractor to construct a new U.S. Port of Entry, Portal, North Dakota to replace the original border station built in 1932.   POE requires significant expansion and total replacement of the existing facility to meet current safety, security, circulation and efficiency standards.  The work consists of two main phases; Phase I construction services for construction of a new 70,000 gross square foot facility and Phase II construction work consists of a new 10,000 square foot Border Patrol Building and ancillary buildings totaling approximately 29,000 square feet.  Phase I and Phase II construction will increase the site size from 1.5 to 11.5 acres, expanding the current border station inspection lanes and provide other expanded border station functions, incorporating new exit and entry requirements developed by the Department of Homeland Security.
If negotiations result in a final price for Phase II construction within Congressional funding limits, the Government intends to exercise the option for Phase II construction pending availability of funds.  If the negotiation efforts do not render a final price for Phase II construction within available funding, the Government will not exercise the option for Phase II construction.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for RTAX Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) RiskReduction Testing.  This testing is in support of the Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA) life performance evaluation using real world user designs in the RTAX250S andRTAX2000S Actel parts.	This testing is being performed to mitigate the risk of usingthese parts types in NASA Space Flight Programs.  Actel is the sole supplier of theselargest available gate FPGAs and these parts are the only non-volitile FPGA that havebeen demonstrated to meet the requirements of space flight environment.  These exactparts will not be flown in space; rather these tests will characterize the performance atthe parts specification limits.  This latest version of FPGAs is a larger gate count inrelation to existing spaceflight qualified FPGAs.  These parts are the baseline innumerous NASA programs and this evaluation is critical to their acceptance for flightreadiness. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the testing services from Actel Corporation.  Actelpossesses unique knowledge of the internal design of the parts because they designed andmanufactured these parts and this inherent knowledge will greatly assist in the analysisof the test data and the preparation and performance of the testing and providesignificant cost savings to the Government.  Actel will be performing the testing ontheir parts using their own test equipment, utilizing internal experts should a failureoccur. Using Actel for this effort greatly reduces the risk of additional problems andassociated cost due to the utilization of the Burn-In Boards that already exist at theActel facility.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon May 30, 2008.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) has a requirement for engineering technical services and support to perform a Component Improvement Program (CIP) for the J52 engine in the Navy’s EA-6B aircraft, and intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with United Technologies Corporation/Pratt & Whitney, Military Engines 20, 400 Main Street, East Hartford, CT 06108-0968.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541330, Engineering Services.  The Component Improvement Program (CIP) is a continuing engineering support program that provides engineering effort, laboratory testing, and technical data as required to ensure safe, reliable, and cost effective operation of the J52 engine.  The CIP effort will include investigation of problems, design of engineering solutions, development of corrective actions, and performance of unique testing, as set forth in selected Engineering Project Descriptions (EPDs).  Engineering support is categorized into the following three areas:  1. Problem Solving involving rapid investigation and resolution of fleet problems related to safety, readiness, and operability.  2. Problem Avoidance through an aggressive program of mission testing, analytical sampling of fleet hardware, and engineering analysis designed to forecast the wear out rates, life limits, and problems with hardware before they occur in the fleet.  3. Product Improvement to develop and qualify design changes, repair procedures and alternate sources where substantial savings in operation and support costs can be realized.  The following capabilities are essential to provide the necessary engineering support services for CIP:  a. An in-place engineering team knowledgeable of the J52 design and manufacturing methodologies; b. An in-place logistics support team knowledgeable of Navy maintenance practices and J52 engine maintenance and support concepts; c. Ready access to full scale test facilities capable of conducting simulated sea-level testing of the J52 engine; d. Ready access to component and rig test facilities capable of conducting a full range of turbo-machinery diagnostic testing; e. Ready access to an engineering design team knowledgeable in the full range of state-of-the-art propulsion and power technology areas such as applied mechanics, heat transfer, vibration and stress analysis, thermodynamics, and aerodynamics; f. Demonstrated experience in the management of design, development, qualification, and support of the J52 engine.  United Technologies Corporation/Pratt & Whitney (Pratt & Whitney) has rights in privately developed commercial technologies and processes incorporated into the J52 engine and has privately developed computer software needed for J52 analysis.  This privately developed data, along with the corporate expertise necessary to identify and correct problems with the J52 engine, are the sole property of Pratt & Whitney.  Given their involvement with the design, development, qualification, manufacturing, and continuing improvements of the J52 engine, their ready access to the original design intent, original engineering drawings, and the most recent design changes to the J52, and their immediate access to the necessary special tooling, special test equipment, and test facilities necessary to prototype and test proposed J52 engineering solutions, Pratt & Whitney is the only known firm with the technical expertise, technical knowledge, and technical data to provide the required engineering support.  It is anticipated that a task order under a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) containing one cost-type CLIN will be awarded.  The term of the task order is expected to be approximately twelve months.  The Government reserves the right to process the procurement on a sole source basis based upon the responses received.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Contracting Department Philadelphia intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the acquisition of MEO Subcontracting Support for Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC).  In accordance with the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76 (revised), Performance of Commercial Activities, a public-private competition for Identification Card Administration services has been announced.  In order for the Agency Tender Official (ATO) to effectively compete with private industry and in light of the fact that the military billets under study will be reprogrammed to other functions and not be available to be part of the MEO, it has been determined that it is in the governments best interest to obtain an MEO Subcontractor to assist with creating the resulting agency tender.  If the government wins the A-76 competition, the MEO Subcontractor would then commence performance for those functions it proposed to perform in the initial agency tender offer. These services may include, but are not limited to, Generating and printing Common Access Cards and Non Common Access Cards to all eligible personnel consistent with DoD policies, procedures and RAPIDS operational guidelines, Serving as the point-of-contact for reporting lost, stolen, or re-issuance of cards, providing statistical data on the number of cards issued, number of cards updated, and number of cards lost, stolen or re-issued on a monthly basis, responsible for CAC stock and consumables to include ordering, management and accountability , Documentation and Training and performing the LRA function of PKI.   Services may be performed at approximately 54 installations throughout CONUS, Hawaii and Guam.  It is intended to award a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite delivery, Indefinite Quantity type contract under which task orders shall be issued. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will consist of two phases.  Phase I tasking will consist of the MEO subcontractor working with the ATO to develop a concept of operations for the resultant agency tender offer.  If the government wins the A-76 competition, Phase 2 will consist of the MEO Subcontractor performing those Identification Card Administration functions it proposed to perform in the initial agency tender offer.  It is anticipated that Phase 2 will consist of a phase-in period, an eight month base period and four, one year option periods.  The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 561110.  This acquisition will be conducted as an unrestricted, full and open competition.  The RFP shall require the submission of a technical proposal as well as a price proposal.  RFP N00189-08-R-Z046 will be made available electronically, upon its release, at http://www.neco.navy.mil on or around 2 July 2008.  All contractors must be registered (http://www.ccr.gov) in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Contracting Department, Philadelphia Office announces the intent to contract directly with the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) for a requirement for a military-focused resiliency-building family services program to serve armed forces families at the United States Marine Corps at 29 Palms and the United States Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division.  
Under Contract Number N00189-08-C-Z009, UCLA is currently providing the same services to military families located at Naval Special Warfare (NSW) (Coronado and Little Creek Bases), Marine Corps (Camps Pendleton and Lejeune, and Hawaii and Okinawa Bases), and SeaBee (Gulfport Base) units. Period of performance for this effort is from 11 March 2008 through 10 March 2009.
A modification to Contract N00189-08-C-Z009 to include the 29 Palms and Port Hueneme sites is in the best interest of the Government, as any other source would result in a duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfillment of the requirement.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

Vendors/contractors shall provide FULL name, FULL SSN, Date of Birth, Place of Birth and a specific statement attesting that the person(s) for whom they are requesting access are citizens of the United States. By so stating, the vendor/contractor is certifying that they have positive documentation of that person?s citizenship on file (i.e. a signed and verified EEVF I-9 form). The request shall also state the specific reason for the visit request and the specific date(s) for which they are requesting access to Norfolk Naval Shipyard (i.e., date of delivery). Material Shipments: Upon completion of the above documentation, vendors/contractors shall fax the letter to the Material Division (phone: 757-396-3141 and fax: 757-396-1029).

A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  Submit questions in writing via fax or e-mail prior to one (1) before the response date.  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  See Numbered Note: N/A.   52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors - a combination of price and: delivery/a determination of responsibility/ technically acceptable low bids/ past performance.  The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter sho!  uld not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or aff!  irmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or sim ilar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter?s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ . All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, Federal Tax ID Number, Cage Code, DUNs Number and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

In order to ensure data compatibility and accuracy, the circumstance permitting "Other than full and open competition" is FAR 6.302-1 (b)only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s)exist; and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate under the authority of
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.501 (a), on a sole source basis with  I/S Management Strategies, Ltd. of Whitefish Bay, WI., for the continuation of services utilizing I/S Management’s software and tools to fulfill alternate software pricing structures in the Agency’s mainframe z/OS operating environment. SSA intends to expand an existing study of the economic feasibility of changing some software licensing structures to workload license charges (WLC), sub-capacity pricing, or other software pricing models where it is in the best interest of the Government. SSA currently operates six (6) IBM z/Series mainframes at the National Computer Center (NCC) in Baltimore, MD including zAAP processors. The Agency runs mainframe software products from hundreds of vendors on 29LPARS. The Agency requires services from a vendor that is independent from the software products running on its mainframe environment to continue software pricing model assessments. The contractor shall assist SSA in further studies of alternate software pricing structures in the Agency’s mainframe z/OS operating environment. The contractor will assist the Agency in building a comprehensive analysis of software products on the Agency’s z/Series mainframes. This analysis will allow SSA to formulate expert knowledge of mainframe software to assist the Agency in planning and execution of software procurement activities. The outcome of the expanded study will allow SSA to leverage new knowledge of software pricing models that allows for savings to the Government. SSA previously conducted market research and published a sources sought notice to identify alternative sources of supply for these services. The research resulted in I/S Management Strategies being the only organization uniquely qualified to implement all the tasks required by SSA. Again, this is a notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with I/S Management Strategies for follow-on services and is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed purchase order for the services requested. Any responsible firm that feels it has the capability to provide the necessary expert services to meet this requirement may respond in writing no later than May 30, 2008, with capability statements and information describing in full detail their capabilities to accomplish SSA’s objective. Capability statements must fully detail the respective firm’s specific expertise in providing these types of services; as well as provide full descriptions of the firm’s successful performance of services of similar type, size, scope, and complexity as those described herein.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Verbal responses are NOT acceptable and will not be considered. All responses to this notice must be submitted by 
May 30, 2008.  Responses may be sent via E-mail only to the point of contact listed below. No Phone Calls or Faxes.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is a Pre-solicitation Notice to provide a synopsis of a proposed contract solicitation to interested parties.  This Notice does not require a response from interested parties nor does it commit the Government to solicit or award a contract.

Background
The Rural Development area within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is the lead federal entity in rural economic and community development.  Rural Development accomplishes its mission by providing assistance to rural America through a network of 47 state offices and numerous other field office locations covering 50 states, plus the Pacific Trust Territories, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Rural Development’s headquarters is located in Washington, District of Columbia, with additional operations in St. Louis, Missouri.

Synopsis
USDA Rural Development (Agency) intends to obtain technical support services to provide maintenance support and enhancement development to one of its official accounting and financial management systems - Automated Multi-housing Accounting System (AMAS).  The Agency, as part of supporting its overall role in providing agricultural credit and rural development assistance for the Multiple Family Housing (MFH) loan and grant program, has initiated activities to develop and enhance Agency information management.  The continued shift from internal Agency automated systems used by USDA employees to a combination of internal, intranet and internet systems serving our varied customers mandates improved and responsive automation support.  

The AMAS loan portfolio contains approximately 21,000 loans with an outstanding principal balance in excess of $11.8 billion.  AMAS currently consists of about 400 COBOL (600,000 lines of code) programs and 9 subsystems.  The on-line system is written primarily in ADS-0 with some usage of DC-COBOL, and is made up of about 300 maps and dialogs.  There are approximately 300 Job Control Language (JCL) members.  Structured programming techniques have been used.  The choice of development tool set and architecture will be determined by the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) using the suite of tools approved by the Agency.  The various automated components, which support the Agency loan programs, are at different stages of development effort in an attempt to meet E-File/GPEA mandates.  The architecture of these components is evolving from a pure block-mode, mainframe environment to one of web-enabled intranet, extranet, and internet capabilities interfacing with some legacy processes.  Common processes are being shared between programs where feasible to reduce maintenance overhead.  All new development is aimed at re-usability among programs.

Rural Development requires software maintenance and enhancement support for AMAS.  This may include supporting documentation modifications and/or improvements, designing and/or developing software maintenance/enhancements, testing, supporting data base changes, and supporting any new technologies that are introduced.  Various requests for data occur sporadically through the year, coming from Office of Inspector General (OIG), General Accounting Office (GAO), or Congressional requests.  These requests must also be fulfilled as part of the work duties assigned.  Additionally, the Agency direct loan and grant program’s automated components must comply with OMB Circular A-129 performance goals, the Treasury Financial Manual, Circular A-123 guidance for internal control systems, Circular A-127 guidance for financial management systems, and Circular A-130, guidance for security requirements.  Consideration must also be given to the JFMIP Government-Wide systems automation requirements and the E-File/GPEA initiatives.

Acquisition will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items procedures.  Full and Open competition will be exercised.  The Government intends to award a single contract to the offeror who provides the best value to the Government.  The contract will be for one (1) base year with four (4) option years to be exercised by the Government if found to be in its best interest.  The approximate solicitation release date is May 27, 2008.  The solicitation will be available and distributed solely through the Federal Business Opportunities website: http://www.fbo.gov .  All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation and any amendments, will be distributed solely through the website listed.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  Offerors must obtain a DUNS number and register in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov ) in order to transact business with USDA.

Inquiries will only be accepted by email to the Point of Contact listed below.

Interested parties shall submit proposals containing relevant pricing and service information as specified in the solicitation.  Proposals must be received by 2:00 pm ET on June 13, 2008, and should be submitted electronically as instructed in the solicitation.

<DESC>MSHA IS SEEKING VENDORS THAT CAN PROVIDE THE BELOW REQUIREMENTS:

The Academy Printing and Training Materials Distribution Branch completes printing and mailing of MSHA documents, training materials, flyers, PPL’s, PIB’s, posters etc.  The VideoJet labeling system used to complete the mailings requires an upgrade to the PC Controller.  The current PC controller is at the end of the life cycle; it can only print from a TXT2 format and still has a 5 ½ inch floppy. Due to these limitations the process to print needs to have data downloaded from different software packages must then be  converted to TXT2 format. 

The upgrade to the controller will be using Windows XP to bring it into compliance with the Department of Labor and MSHA.  The upgrade will also allow MSHA security patches to be installed.  The system upgrade would also allow labeling to be completed from other input formats, such as Access, Excel, and TXT, along with the ability to use bar codes, and the equipment will also be network enabled.  Video Jet Back end (printers) is still usable for the next few years.  

POC is Rhonda Emmert @ emmert.rhonda@dol.gov or fax to 304-256-3350.  NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.  Please notify Rhonda Emmert via e-mail or fax if you can provide the requirements specified herein.

<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>The Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL), located in Ann Arbor, MI intends acquire two Seabird SBE 16 Conductivity, Temperature and Depth (CTDs) Data Acquisition systems.
<p>The 16 conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) data acquisition systems are required for a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) multiple-sensor data collection project and for long-term deployment in a harsh environment. The ROV project will require the attachment of turbidity, PAR, oxygen, H2S, pH, ORP, and chlorophyll sensors requiring six (6) analog senor inputs and one serial data input. The ROV project will require the use of an Aanderra Optode 3830 serial data oxygen sensor to collect data in a high hydrogen sulfide (H2S) environment. An optical oxygen sensor has been chosen for this project as traditional polarographic sensors can experience chemical fouling in H2S environments. After ROV use, the system will be deployed in the same environment and will require the long-term biological fouling resistance that is also achievable with optical oxygen sensors.</p>
<p>The Seabird SBE 16 CTD appears to be the only oceanographic data recorder that will meet these requirements. The Applied Microsystems CTD cannot accept the Optode 3830 serial input and does not appear to have the necessary extra analog channels to host the six (6) sensors needed to meet project data collections requirements. The YSI 6600 CTD cannot accept the Optode 3830, the 6600 optical oxygen can't be deployed at the required depth, and the system has no additional serial data or analog channel inputs.</p>
<p>Salient Characteristics for Brand Name or Equal: The CTD must be able to accept an Optode 3830 serial input and have the necessary extra analog channels to host the six (6) sensors needed to meet project data collection requirements. Systems must be able to be deployed at the required depth.</p>
<p>The electrical and mechanical requirements listed below place minimal demands on size, weight, buoyancy, and power required of the Phantom S2 ROV planned for use during data collection. The specifications also represent data collection requirements of both ROV and long-term deployment projects.</p>
<p>Electrical<br />. Power - alkaline batteries or external power 9-18 VDC or wider<br />. Sensor power out from CTD - at least 500 mA @ 10.5 - 11 VDC<br />. Samples - Conductivity, Temperature, Depth - 355,000 or more<br />. Sensor input range - 0-5VDC; 6 differential A/D channels<br />. RS-232 sensor data input channel<br />. RS-232 system interface<br />Mechanical<br />. Diameter - 3.9 inches<br />. Length - 31.80 inches<br />. Weight in water - 5 lbs<br />. Depth - 110 meters or greater</p>
<p>Equipment is needed within 35 days. The government knows of no other company able to supply this type of equipment besides Sea-Bird. Only the Seabird CTD will meet planned scientific data collection goals. Firms who believe they have a product that will meet all the requirements specified herein, including form fit, and function, and delivery must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide the supply and satisfy the Government's needs. Along with descriptive literature on the equipment being offered must be provided. In addition shall include name, telephone number and address of concerns for which you have furnished this type of equipment previously. Interested parties must respond within (10) days after publication of this notice. If no affirmative responses are received, the government intends to issue a purchase order to Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc. through the commercial acquisition process. The Central Region Administrative Division (CRAD), requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/.

<DESC>The HUBZone Program was enacted into law as part of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997.  The purpose of the HUBZone Program is to provide for Federal contracting assistance to qualified HUBZone small business concerns.  15 U.S.C. § 657a(a).  Specifically, the program’s purpose is to target government contracts to small businesses located in and that employ residents from historically underutilized business zones (HUBZones).  The Federal contracting assistance provided to qualified HUBZone Small Business Concerns (SBCs) is in the form of sole source awards, HUBZone set-asides, or price evaluation preferences in full and open competition.  To qualify as a HUBZone small business, in general, firms must meet the following criteria:  its principal office must be located in a HUBZone; it must be at least 51% owned and controlled by one or more US citizens; and at least 35% of its employees must reside in a HUBZone.

The Small Business Act defines the term HUBZone to mean any area located within 1 or more:  (1) qualified census tracts; (2) qualified nonmetropolitan counties; (3) lands within the external boundaries of an Indian reservation; (4) redesignated areas; or (5) base closure areas.  15 U.S.C. § 632(p)(1); see also 13 C.F.R. § 126.103.  Further information about the HUBZone Program is available at https://eweb1.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/index.cfm.

In 1998, at the inception of the program, the SBA created a web-based system that maps these HUBZone areas.  Specifically, the SBA contracted with Caliper Corporation for a customized Maptitude version that provides end-user access to all software functions and geographic data sets provided with Maptitude, as well as a customer interface that  supports convenient end-user access to SBA data sets and maps.  The SBA updates these maps when it receives new data relating to a HUBZone area (e.g., SBA receives unemployment data from the U.S. Department of Labor).  
 
Currently, the SBA has a need to update the HUBZone maps based upon data received from several Federal agencies relating to unemployment, census tracts, BRAC areas, and difficult development areas.  This data needs to be uploaded into the customized HUBZone Geo-code mapping system.  This customized system is Maptitude, GIS for Windows – Version 4.1.  SBA needs these maps updated within 8 weeks from the date of award of the contract.  The SBA currently does not own the shape files relating to the HUBZone maps.  

The purpose of this announcement is to get a better understanding of the marketplace for these services.  Please note that this is a market survey for informational  purposes only and is not a solicitation.  There is no solicitation document available at this time and no reimbursement will be made for costs associated with responding to this announcement.  All responses must be submitted via e-mail in accordance with the instructions that follow.  

Responses to this announcement must provide detailed, concise information about your organization’s capabilities in providing the services similar to those described above, as well as verifiable experience within the past five (5) years for similar services. Information on prior experience shall include the contract number, dollar value of the contract, period of performance, current status, and current Government point of contact information including name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. In addition, the response must state business size status (small; 8(a); small disadvantaged; HUBZone, service disabled, veteran owned, etc.).  

This information must be emailed to Joanie Newhart at joanie.newhart@sba.gov by May 30, 2008.

<DESC><p>The Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) intends to award a sole-source, Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) follow-on contract to contract FA8819-04-C-0002 for Contractor Operations Support, Contractor Logistics Support, and Transition to Blue Suit Operations needed for the operations and maintenance of the SBSS Block 10 system. The initial contract was awarded to Northrop Grumman Mission System acting in capacity as the integrating contractor with Boeing subcontract team responsible for the development, delivery, launch and operations of the space vehicle and ground elements. The specific tasks to be performed for this follow on contract are outlined in the attached SOW and will be performed at Schriever AFB, CO.
<p>The estimated period of performance for the Contractor Operations Support is 19 February 2009 to 18 February 2010 (1 year), with a possibility of 2 additional 1-year options. The estimated period of performance for Contractor Logistics Support is launch plus 61 days for 1 year, with four (4) 12-month options. The estimated period of performance for Transition to Blue Suit Operations is 1 October 2009 for a period of eighteen (18) months. Approximate value for one year of Contractor Operations Support and Contractor Logistics Support is estimated at $25M.</p>
<p>The intended source for this effort is Boeing Company, 2600 Westminster Blvd., Seal Beach, CA 90740, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 - "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".<br />The Government believes Boeing is the only company capable of providing the subject requirements based on the Government's need for supplies and services deemed to be available only from the primary source for the follow-on contract. This effort is for the continued provisioning of highly specialized supplies and services. It is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or would result in delays affecting the operations of the space vehicle and logistics support to ground element. As the SBSS Block 10 developer, Boeing is uniquely qualified to continue providing operations and maintenance efforts, logistics and sustainment support activities, and provide the necessary maintenance familiarization training (blue suit transition) along with factory reach-back support.<br />Additionally, the current analysis approach includes a multi-year, multi-spiral development project with source code, proprietary hardware, and engineering design units to which the Government does not own full data rights. The reverse-engineering required to implement source code and engineering design from previous spirals will likely result in duplication of costs to the Government for investments already spent on the baseline system.</p>
<p>Any persons or companies interested can submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) containing the following information: Company name, address, primary POC including phone number, technical description of the offeror's experience, knowledge of Air Force Space Command space situational awareness (SSA), taskable space sensors and the associated Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and architecture, description of facilities and equipment intended for use in support of this effort; and proof of security clearances for government evaluation. Interested parties must have experience with analysis of Air Force Space Command military systems and capabilities, to include development of software and associated software tools, and must have detailed knowledge of Air Force Space Command space control systems, capabilities, and their operations across all SSA mission areas. The offeror must also have experience with operations, maintenance, and support of space ground systems/operations and detailed knowledge of applicable Space Wing operating and maintenance instructions and procedures.</p>
<p>Interested parties must have the capabilities to support depot level maintenance, engineering analysis, and the expertise for integration of outside government depot maintenance capabilities into the sustainment concept. To mitigate schedule risks, interested parties must have strong experience with ongoing efforts and developments in SSA. Interested parties must also have expertise in developing, quantifying, and assessing various approaches that meet system performance requirements. These assessments shall include credible performance, cost, and schedule information to provide sufficient system trade spaces for decision-making. Interested parties must also have knowledge of current effects on SBSS and SSA. All interested parties must be cleared to handle government equipment and information up to, and including TS/SCI/SAR and have personnel with current TS/SSBIs as well as a Top Secret - SCI accredited SCIF.</p>
<p>Responses to this synopsis should be submitted via email in electronic format MS Word 2000 or newer format, or PDF format and must conform to 8.5" X 11" page size, type 12 font, with a maximum of 20 total pages (11x17" foldouts with minimum 12 font are acceptable but will count as two pages). Send SOCs to attention: Capt Richard Hulun &amp; Dwight Taeza or e-mailed to richard.hulun@losangeles.af.mil &amp; dwight.taeza@losangeles.af.mil to be received by 4:00 P.M, PST, on 20 June 2008. Oral communications are not acceptable. Submittals that contain classified materials must be coordinated with either the primary or secondary points of contact. No contract award will be made on the basis of offers or proposals received in response to this notice. The NAICS code for this announcement is 541330 with the applicable size standard of $25M. Any business in this area of expertise will be allowed to participate in the submittal of SOC's. Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are highly encouraged. However, all businesses must be capable to support operations pertaining to the description of services at the time of submitting SOC's.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) acting for the Coordinating Center for Environment Health and Injury Prevention (CCEHIP), intends to award a sole source firm fixed-price contract to the Hektoen Institute for Medical Research, 2100 West Harrison Street, Chicago, Illinois, 60612. The purpose of the proposed contract is to provide a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of Routine Screening for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) to be conducted by the Collaborative Research Unit at Stroger Hospital. Before IPV can be prevented, research is needed to figure out how big the problem is, where it is, and whom it affects. CDC learns about a problem by gathering and studying data. This data is critical because it helps decision makers use resources where they are needed most. The Collaborative Research Unit at Stroger Hospital is part of a unique forerunner program located in an inner-city public hospital that is a national model for hospital-based domestic violence services and training. The program provides direct services to victims of abuse that include crisis intervention, safety assessment and planning, individual counseling, information about legal rights, court and systems advocacy, access to emergency shelter, financial assistance and referrals to other needed resources. The Collaborative Research Unit possesses the unique conditions and extensive experience for implementing this RCT given their relationship as a partner with a medical school, their highly experienced and qualified epidemiology research unit, high patient load and a renowned IPV advocacy program. These conditions are critical to adequately follow Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved procedures for data collection. CDC anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) permitting other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Hektoen Institute for Medical Research is the only source available to provide services that meet mission critical requirements. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation. No Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities/qualifications to perform the effort, in writing to Ms. Pamela A. Woodard via email at plw9@cdc.gov with the reference number (2008-52592) referenced in the subject line, no later than 5:00 pm Eastern Time, 23 June 2008.

<SUBJECT>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - DOD ESI COTS AND SOA SYSTEMS INTEGRATION SERVICES
<SOLNBR>N0010408IZF37
<CONTACT>
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI). The Department of Defense (DoD) Enterprise Software Initiative (ESI) is requesting information concerning systems integration services for commercial off the shelf software (COTS) and the implementation of COTS software using Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) within the DoD.  This RFI provides an opportunity for respondents to submit their ideas, initiatives, and/or processes related to this request. 
This RFI is subject to the provisions of FAR 52.215-3 and is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  The RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment to issue an RFP.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to pay for any information, or otherwise reimburse responders for any costs associated with their respective submissions in response to this RFI.  Any response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  This RFI is issued for the purpose of obtaining industry feedback on systems integration services as they relate to COTS implementations and COTS implementations using SOA within the DoD.  
Any proprietary or source selection information MUST be marked as such, on a page-by-page basis.  The Government intends to use third party, non-Government (contractor) support personnel as subject matter experts in the review of responses received, including the review of any marked or unmarked proprietary or source selection information provided.  Appropriate non-disclosure agreements have been executed between the third party, non-Government (contractor) support personnel and the Government and are on file with the Government.  A submission of a response to this RFI constitutes the respondents acknowledgement and agreement that the information provided in the response, including any marked or unmarked proprietary or source selection information, may be disclosed to the these third party, non-Government (contractor) support personnel.  
BACKGROUND
In May 2004, the DoD ESI established Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with Accenture, BearingPoint, CSC, Deloitte, and IBM covering the implementation and integration of COTS software.  Although the BPAs were optimized for use in implementing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software, the scope of the BPAs covered all COTS software, not just ERP.  These BPAs are scheduled to expire in May 2009. Accordingly, ESI has conducted market research to determine the most appropriate scope of services to be covered by the next generation of System Integration ordering vehicles.
ESIs purpose and objectives in establishing ordering vehicles for systems integration services are to:X	Streamline the acquisition and implementation process;X	Provide access to the best qualified vendors based on distinguishable service offerings;X	Add value to programs by providing education and tools to institutionalize best practices (align project management and contracting best practices by structuring ordering vehicles and orders in accordance with a proven implementation methodology);X	Develop a vehicle that forces discipline, rigor and best practices behavior (including pricing methods and clarity of buyer duties without cumbersome assumptions);X	Accelerate adoption of DoD data and services strategies and determine impact of SOA and DISAs SOA Foundation on ordering vehicles;X	Provide a contract vehicle for the segment of system integration services with the greatest expected demand within the DoD over the next five to ten years; and,X	Provide a contract vehicle for a scope of services that is not covered adequately by any existing contract vehicles available to DoD programs.
ESIs preliminary conclusion is to add to the scope of the existing BPA services to cover the implementation and integration of COTS technology using SOA disciplines (focused on COTS and SOA Integration Services - CSIS).  CSIS is also commonly referred to as Next Generation Systems Integration (NGSI).   
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
Please provide information to assist ESI in answering the following questions:
1.	Competition Strategy.  a.	Should ESI conduct a single competition to cover both COTS and SOA integration services or break it into two distinct competitions?b.	Are there different qualifications, skill sets and business models for firms that implement COTS software and firms that implement SOA-based COTS solutions?  Please explain how they are similar and how they are different. c.	How different are the methodologies used to implement COTS versus SOA?2.	Pricing.  a.	What is the best way that ESI can develop an ordering vehicle with fixed prices for COTS and SOA integration services that will result in a menu of contract line items that are priced for a program to order?b.	What is the best method to secure and evaluate pricing (at the ordering vehicle level and at the Task Order level) for a COTS implementation?c.	What is the best method to secure and evaluate pricing (at the ordering vehicle level and at the Task Order level) for SOA implementation services?d.	What information does your firm need in order to provide a fixed price bid for all services and deliverables related to a COTS or SOA project?e.	For variances in scope and/or requirements at the program level, can a formula be developed to enable a program to determine the price that would apply to their scope?  3.	Alternative Contract Vehicles. a.	Are you aware of any existing contract vehicles or programs available to DoD programs to order COTS and/or SOA integration services?b.	If yes, please provide a list of such vehicles, the agency who manages each vehicle, a summary description of the scope of services covered by each vehicle, performance dates, pricing methods, your firms actual usage of the vehicle and any other relevant information.

Responses should be sent in either Microsoft Word or portable document format (pdf) and shall not exceed 10 pages in length.  Please provide your response via email to Sylvia.Neidig@navy.mil no later than 12 June 2008.

The BLU-109X/B is based on the preexisting BLU-109/B case configuration with the incorporation of the improved components identified below. The procurement of 20 BLU-109X/B cases can only be met by Rand because their experience and existing tooling will allow deliveries in time to meet the accelerated qualification schedule directed by the Air Staff. Rand's previous manufacturing support of 685 ARSS IM/BLU-121 test asset procurements and BLU-117, BLU-109, and BLU-122 production contracts has consistently proven to be technically sound, cost effective, and timely.

<p>NOTE<br />The "X" prefix before each drawing number indicates the drawing has not been authenticated. The BLU-109X/B engineering data package is presently under development.</p>
<p>The contractor shall remove the hardware corresponding to those items listed above from the twenty (20) Government provided BLU-109/B warhead cases and install the improved hardware components IAW Case Assembly, Empty, BLU-109X/B drawing X200827956. Disposition of removed hardware will be determined at end of contract.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform periodic inspections of the assemblies and the hardware it is manufacturing to ensure compliance with associated drawing(s). Inspection data shall be available for review upon requrst.</p>

<CONTACT>Donald Hafer, Contracting Officer, 304-285-1390,jodi.collins@netl.doe.gov;Jodi Collins, Contract Specialist, 304-285-1390, jodi.collins@netl.doe.gov

<a href="mailto:jodi.collins@netl.doe.gov">Jodi Collins, Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>DOE Submission - The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), NationalEnergy Technology Laboratory (NETL), intends to issue a full and open competitive solicitation to procure specialized engineering services to perform a design/build requirement for a Fuel Flexible Gasification System.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.  The Contractor shall provide all facilities, supervision, personnel, tools, equipment, and services to perform the contract requirements (a specified area at the NETL Morgantown, WV site will be available for constructing and testing of the gasification system).
The U.S. Department of Energy, National Energy Technology Laboratory is developing Coal/biomass co-gasification technology to reduce the overall CO2 emissions associated with Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power production.  Coal/biomass mixture gasification presents many unique challenges.  Individually, coal and biomass gasifiers are not easily adapted to support the co-gasification of coal/biomass mixture materials and define their physical and chemical behavior under high pressure and high temperature gasification conditions.  To accomplish this, the construction of a small-scale, readily operated fuel flexible gasifier is necessary to generate char, tar, slag, and syngas samples to test process concepts, validate computer models, develop diagnostic tools, and screen the relative gasification behavior of coal/biomass mixture feedstocks. 
The objective of this requirement is to have a contractor design a high temperature, high pressure fuel flexible gasification system (designed to the operational parameters provided by DOE/NETL) suitable for kinetic experiments.  Upon acceptance of the design elements, the contractor would then be required to fabricate the fuel flexible gasification system, install at NETL-MGN, test and operate the system demonstrating its operational functionality within the specified parameters provided, prepare operational manuals and train DOE/NETL personnel to operate and maintain the gasification system.  The fabrication portion of this requirement would include an expressed warranty/performance guarantee as to the operation of the designed system.
NETL previously posted a sources sought notice on March 18, 2008.  As indicated in that announcement, the following requirements are considered essential to successfully complete this requirement: 
1.  Experience designing continuous gas and solids flow system gasification reactors.
2.  Experience in gasifier design and installation of the gasification system incorporating into existing infrastructure. 
3.  Capability to design the gasification system to achieve high gas and solid feedstock heating rates and demonstrate the high heating rate potential through calculation.
4.  Experience designing the gasification system with an instrumentation and control and data acquisition system. 
5.  Ability to provide pricing and details, as a purchase option, to produce a detailed design of the gasification reactor, but with modification as complete re-circulating transport reactor.  The re-circulating transport reactor shall consist of a transport riser, a cyclone, a stand pipe and a non-mechanical valve.
6.  Capability to provide warranty the performance and operation of the gasification system for a period of not less than 1-year commissioning at NETL-MGN.  The warranty shall include, but not be limited to: 1) gasification system performance (e.g., the performance of gasifier sub-systems for gas/liquid feeds, syngas recycle, solids feed systems, achieving and maintaining gasification reactor temperature and pressure, etc.) and 2) sustainable problem and maintenance free operation (e.g., the sustainable long term operation of heaters, reaction tubes, refractory, valves, condensers, etc.)
It is anticipated that the solicitation will be made available for downloading from the IIPS Internet page on or about April 21, 2008 with proposals due on or about May 21, 2008.  The IIPS page is located at http://e-center.doe.gov.  At this Internet site you will be able to register with IIPS, enabling you to download the solicitation, join the mailing list for the solicitation, submit questions, review responses to questions, and to submit a proposal.  If you need technical assistance in registering of for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or email the Help Desk personnel at IIPS_HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov.
Questions relating to the solicitation are required to be submitted electronically through the question submittal option of the IIPS program. All responses to solicitation questions will be released on the IIPS Internet page.  The solicitation will only be made available in IIPS, no hard (paper) copies of the solicitation and related documents will be made available.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. (ii) The solicitation number is 1043795-08-DH. This acquisition is issued as a Request for Quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clause s are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12. (iv)  The associated NAICS code is 423440. The small business size standard is 500.

The Food and Drug Administration proposes to acquire a the following system:  0001 - Synergy2 Waters IIPLC System including installation in accordance with the following specifications:  The following attributes are specifications for a microplate reader with multi-detection capabilities for reading Absorbance, Fluorescence Intensity (FI), Fluorescence Polarization (FP), and Luminescence:  *The new system must be compatible with existing Bio-Tek instruments currently in the lab facilitating better utilization of existing equipment.  The hardware and software need to be integrated to allow for greater flexibility.  *The system must be modular in design for adding additional detection capability at a later date, such as Time Resolved Fluorescence (TRF) option.  * The system footprint must be no larger that 43.5 cm lenth x 44.5 cm width x 37.2 cm height due to the very limited space that is available in the laboratory.  *The instrument must be capable to accomodate a variety of plate types and configurations we use for the different assays performed in this laboratory.  These include plates with the following: Regular polycarbonate plates with 6-, 12-, 24-, and 384-wells; PCR Plates; Luminescence plates with 6-, 12-, 24-, 96-, and 384- wells. *The wavelenght selection for Fluorescense reading must have deep blocking interference filters and dichroic mirrors that would enable blocking stray light.  For Absorbance detection must utilize a monochromator so that the wavelength selected is within precise measurements. *Because this equipment will be shared as a common resource for several labs, we require flexibility with respect to the potential operating range of the assay, thereby reducing the need for additional capitol equipment purchases.  Therefore, we require a large dynamic operating range for each of the detector options, as follows: Fluorescence (0-99,999 RFU) Luminescence (0-6,500,000 RLUP; Absorbance (0.0-4.0 OD).  *Due to the very sensitive types of analyses we perform, we require sensitivity down to the following levels for a 96-well plate: Fluorescense Intensity (1pM in 200uL); Fluorescence Polarization (3mP in 200uL); Luminescense (10amol/well flast intensity).

The technical response must provide at least two references of Item No.  0001 being quoted, with preference for a configuration closest to the one be offered.  The proposal must include published specifications that support the specifications for Item No. 0001.

any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest
of national security.

Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except
that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for
`at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an
inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the
properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the
properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is
held—
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former
shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic
corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former
partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in
the domestic partnership; and

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not
have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of
which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of
such expanded affiliated group.

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when
determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted
domestic corporation.

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity
as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining
ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign
incorporated entity; or
 (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition
described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C.
395(b)(1).

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or
indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership
during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership
requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a
plan.

Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership,

control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

COMDTINST 4200.14 Notice for Filing Agency Protests

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>Amendment 2 - This solicitation is being ammended to respond to questions received. The questions and responses are as follows:

Question 1 -  Is there an incumbent contractor?

 Response to Question 1 - Yes

Question 2.  If so, is the incumbent eligible to compete for re-award?

Response to Question 2 - At this time, the Government does not believe so. 

Question 3.  Should the business/price proposals be sealed and bound, separate from the technical proposal?

Response to Question 3 - The business/price proposals need to be separate/unattached documents from the technical proposals, however they do not need to be separately sealed and bound.

Question 4.  Please clarify if/when the contractor pays the employee.  The top line on Page 17 mentions “ensuring accurate payments are made to eligible providers and REE employees.”  Paragraph 3.2.d.on page 21 states, “Payment shall not be made directly to the employee.”  Paragraph 3.2.g states “When an employee erroneously receives payment following a failure to notify the contractor that employment with the Agency ended.” Does the contractor ever pay the employee directly and, if so, under what circumstances?  
 
Response to Question 4 - The contractor shall not pay the employees directly. All payments shall go directly to the providers. Attached is a revised PWS clarifying this issue.

Question 5.  Is REE open to the use of web-based certification forms for the provider’s invoice to the employee and for provider subsidy payment requests from the contractor?  
            
Web-based forms are acceptable, however the contractor must make exceptions for providers unable, or unwilling, to access the forms electronically (i.e. hard copy submissions).
 

Question 6.  Page 23, item 6 – “The number of tuition assistance applicants that were withdrawn”  Does this refer to applicants who withdrew their application or “participants” who cease participation in the program?  (It seems that item 7 refers to “applicants” but item 6 refers to participants.)
            
Response to Question 6 - Both items 6 and 7 refer to participants, not applicants. Additionally, Items 4.1e, 4.1f, and 4.2 b. 5) have been revised to correctly refer to participants. The revised PWS reflects these corrections.

<DESC>The purpose of this contract action is to acquire contractor support for the quality measure development and maintenance life-cycle activities described in the Measure & Instrument Development and Support (MIDS) Umbrella Statement of Work (USOW).

Increasingly, high quality means care that is personalized, prevention-oriented, and patient-centered, based on evidence about the benefits and costs for each particular patient.
Large gaps exist between the CMS of high-quality care for every patient every time and what our health care system delivers. Therefore, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have many important opportunities to help health professionals, patients, and all of the stakeholders in our health care system turn promising new ideas into action to close the quality gaps.

One way CMS will carry out its obligation to the Health Care System and its beneficiaries is through this Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for work to be performed by a Measure & Instrument Development and Support (MIDS) Contractor. This umbrella Statement of Work (SOW) encompasses all of the fundamental activities that may be required of a MIDS Contractor. However, no work will be performed on the umbrella SOW since individual Task Orders will be awarded under the IDIQ for specific requirements.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to notify offerors that due to unexpected and unavoidable absences of various members of the evaluation team, the evaluation of proposals for solicitation HSFEEM-08-Q-0024 for FEMA NFIRS Help Desk Support has been delayed.  The result is that the base period of performance will commence on 1 July 2008 or date of contract award, whichever is later.  I regret this delay but given the nature of the requirement and the necessity of ensuring the evaluations of proposals are thorough and complete, as well as ensuring necessary reviews of award documentation are completed in a thorough manner, there is no other option.  The incumbent’s contract will be initially extended for a period of one month under the provisions of FAR 52.217-8.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.  The solicitation is closed, no other proposals, or revisions to existing submitted proposals, will be accepted.  This notice is intended only to notify interested parties that there has been a delay in the expected award date.  Thank you.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to:  (1) Add classification guidance for white paper submissions as paragraph IV.5 entitled Classification Guidance for Whitepaper Submission; (2) Revise paragraph IV.6 entitled Other Submission Requirements; (3) Add an additional paragraph under VI.2 entitled Classified Submissions; and (4) extend the FY 08 recommended date for white papers to 12 June 2008.  No other changes have been made.

DATES:   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 08 should be submitted by 12 June 2008; FY 09 by 1 March 2009.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 1 June 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details.    

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)/RI is soliciting white papers for various scientific studies, and experiments to increase our knowledge and understanding of the broad range of capabilities required in support of Dominant Cyber Offensive Engagement and Supporting Technology, to include testing of prototype capabilities.  Solutions to basic and applied research and engineering for the problems relating to Dominant Cyber Offensive Engagement and Supporting Technology are sought.  This includes high risk, high payoff capabilities for gaining access to any remotely located open or closed computer information systems; these systems enabling full control of a network for the purposes of information gathering and effects based operations.  Of interest are any and all techniques to enable user and/or root level access to both fixed (PC) or mobile computing platforms.  Robust methodologies to enable access to any and all operating systems, patch levels, applications and hardware are of interest.  Also, we are interested in technology to provide the capability to maintain an active presence within the adversaries’ information infrastructure completely undetected.  Of interest are any and all techniques to enable stealth and persistence capabilities on an adversaries infrastructure.  This could be a combination of hardware and/or software focused development efforts.  
Following this, it is desired to have the capability to stealthily exfiltrate information from any remotely-located open or closed computer information systems with the possibility to discover information with previously unknown existence.  Any and all techniques to enable exfiltration techniques on both fixed and mobile computing platforms are of interest.  Consideration should be given to maintaining a “low and slow” gathering paradigm in these development efforts to enable stealthy operation.  Finally, this BAA’s objective includes the capability to provide a variety of techniques and technologies to be able to affect computer information systems through Deceive, Deny, Disrupt, Degrade, Destroy (D5) effects.   Of interest are any and all techniques including enabling D5 effects to computers and their networks; integration of effects with Access, Stealth and Persistence and Cybint capabilities; command and control of effects; and determining effects’ link to operational impact.  In addition to these main concepts, we desire to have research efforts in the supporting areas including (but not limited to): Information Assurance through Flattened Computer Architectures in special application/user environments; NGPSec: Secure Next Generation Protocol Suite to investigate feasibility and determine whether reinventing the network protocol stack can be done and the resulting success quantified; Proactive Botnet Defense Technology Development specifically as applies to new ideas/concepts for practical application; Carbon nanotubes for high density interconnects and RF applications, to allow for incorporating novel IA designs into computer architectures through nanotube interconnects with nanotube based RF peripherals (antennas).

Research efforts under this program are expected to result in complete functional capabilities ideally addressing the Dominant Cyber Offensive Engagement problem.     However, projects specializing in highly novel and interesting applicable techniques will also be considered, if deemed to be of "breakthrough" quality and importance.  The effectiveness of the developed technologies for potential operational use will be assessed through preplanned testing and evaluation activities.  Technologies that can be transitioned for operational use are of high interest. Offerors are encouraged to describe the pre-conditions that are necessary for the proposed techniques to work efficiently. 
Offerors are encouraged to submit classified white papers via the appropriate channels.     Contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII before submitting any classified white papers.

This effort includes any and all techniques to enable user and/or root level access to both fixed (PC) or mobile computing platforms, using robust methodologies to enable access to operating systems, patch levels, applications, and hardware of interest.  Further techniques include enabling of stealth and persistence capabilities on an adversarial infrastructure, possibly in combination with hardware and/or software focused development.  In addition, other areas include techniques to enable exfiltration on both fixed and mobile computing platforms with consideration given to maintaining a “low and slow” gathering paradigm to enable stealthy operation.  Finally the effort includes any and all techniques to enable D5 effects to computers/networks; and integration of these effects with access, stealth, persistence, Cybint capabilities; command and control of effects; and determination of effects link operational impact. Deliverables will be technical reports, software, demonstrations, and concept prototypes.  The results of the experiments will provide evidence and metrics concerning the assertions/claims about the research.  Demonstrations may involve exploratory development models (i.e. brassboards) if appropriate.

IV. APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION:

1.  APPLICATION PACKAGE:  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  WE ARE SOLICITING WHITE PAPERS ONLY.   DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal, see Section VI of this announcement for further details.    

For additional information, a copy of the AFRL/Rome Research Sites "Broad Agency Announcement (BAA): A Guide for Industry," April 2007, may be accessed at: http://www.fbo.gov/spg/USAF/AFMC/AFRLRRS/Reference%2DNumber%2DBAAGUIDE/listing.html

2.  CONTENT AND FORM OF SUBMISSION:   Offerors are required to submit a 3 to 10 page white paper either via CD, or hard copy (if hard copy, 3 copies will be required), summarizing their proposed approach/solution. All white papers/proposals shall be submitted in Microsoft Word format, and have a font no smaller than 10 pitch with any figures, tables and charts easily legible. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section 1: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name/Address of Company, Technical and Contracting Points of Contact (phone, fax, and email)(this section is NOT included in the page count); and Executive Summary; Section 2: Innovative Claims; Section 3: Technical Objective/Approach (Research Focus, Performance Evaluation,  Unique Features, experiments that will provide evidence concerning research claims/assertions); Section 4: Personnel Qualifications and Experience; Section 5: Transition Plan (if research is successful how will operational transition occur and who are the principle customers?); Section 6: Schedule/Milestones (GANNT Chart by FY preferred); and Section 7: Technical summary/References and Proposed Deliverables.  Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict its white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b).  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, their Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, a fax number, an e-mail address, and reference BAA 08-04-RIKA with their submission. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the technical POC, as discussed in paragraph five of this section.  

3.  SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 08 should be submitted by 12 June 2008; FY 09 by 1 March 2009.  White papers will be accepted until 2:00 p.m. Eastern time on 1 June 2009, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each respective fiscal year after the dates cited. 

4.  FUNDING RESTRICTIONS:  The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18.   Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY, are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS). 

5.  CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE FOR WHITEPAPER SUBMISSIONS:  AFRL/RIGB will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification.  Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only.  Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their white paper submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.

6.  OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.  All responses to this announcement, unclassified or classified, will be sent via U.S. Postal Service registered mail  and addressed to AFRL/RIGB, 525 Brooks Road, Rome NY 13441-4505, and reference BAA-08-04-RIKA,   Electronic submission is not authorized.  Questions can be directed to the cognizant technical POC, W. John Maxey, William.Maxey@rl.af.mil, (315) 330-3617.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance,  will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall scientific and/or technical merit, including technical feasibility, degree of innovation, understanding of the technical, operational approach and program milestones/schedule; (2) Experimental approach for evaluation of the technology; (3) The effort’s potential contribution and relevance to the U. S. Air Force’s Computer Network Attack (CNA)/Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) Information Assurance requirements; (4) The extent to which the offer or demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge; and (5) The reasonableness and realism of: proposed costs, fee (if any).  No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

CLASSIFIED SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RIGB will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET, TOP SECRET (TS), or TS/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access at the appropriate level at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:

   W. John Maxey
    Telephone:      (315) 330-3617
    Email:  William.Maxey@rl.af.mil

In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>Fifth set of questions and answers:<BR><BR>Note:  Deadline for questions is 23 May 2008.<BR><BR>1.  My company is interested is submitting a whitepaper to the UAST BAA.  I have a question pertaining to the Gantt chart that is to be submitting in the whitepaper content and the schedule that is to be submitted over and above the 15 page whitepaper limit. There is some confusion as to what is the difference between the schedule in the whitepaper content and the Gantt chart that is to be submitted separately.<BR><BR>Response: <BR><BR>2.  There is no difference in the data content within the white paper and the Gantt chart.  However, the Government is requesting that the actual Microsoft Project file for the Gantt chart also be included separately within the same CD. Is there a difference?<BR><BR>Response: <BR><BR>No difference<BR> <BR>3.  I see on Page 26 Item 4 says 4. Provide a summary Gantt chart, identifying the major elements of the project, including preliminary and critical design phases and deliverables. <BR><BR>Response: <BR><BR>Again, the Government is requesting this same information as part of the whitepaper write-up.   <BR><BR>4. Page 26 Item 6 says 6.  Provide a separate Microsoft Project file of the Gantt chart (See Appendix F).<BR><BR>Response: <BR><BR>This is correct. However, all required Appendixes are part of the whitepaper, and yes they are over and above the 15 page whitepaper limit.  In other words, there is no penalty for exceeding the 15 page limit if the extra pages pertain to Appendixes.  <BR><BR>4.  The BAA also states on Page 28 Item iii says  iii) 1 Page: Schedule illustrating major milestones and any decision gates. Describe any leveraging opportunities and considerations with other related efforts. Also represent any dependencies from leveraged efforts.<BR> <BR>To me, a Project Gantt chart is to be submitted over and above the 15 pages of the whitepaper.  This Gantt chart will illustrat(e) major milestones and any decision gates. Describe any leveraging opportunities and considerations with other related efforts. Also represent any dependencies from leveraged efforts.<BR> <BR>But the Gantt chart that goes in the whitepaper content (Item 4) will be a summary of the project indicating phases and deliverables. This would be a reflection of the Technical Approach section of the whitepaper. Am I correct in my assumption or are these items the same?<BR><BR>Response:  <BR><BR>That is correct.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. This notice is for information and planning purposes only. This is not a request for proposals and does not commit the government to award a contract; therefore, no solicitation is available at this time. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Coordinating Center for Environment Health and Injury Prevention (CCEHIP) began studying home and recreational injuries in the early 1970s and violence prevention in 1983. From these early activities grew a national program to reduce injury, disability, death, and costs associated with injuries outside the workplace. In June 1992, CDC established the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC). As the lead federal agency for injury prevention, NCIPC works closely with other federal agencies; national, state, and local organizations; state and local health departments; and research institutions in support of research about causes, risk factors, and preventive measures for injuries outside the workplace. Like diseases, injuries are preventable. CDC's Injury Center uses the same scientific methods to prevent injuries that have been used to prevent disease: carefully describing the problem through surveillance, studying factors that increase or decrease risk for injury, designing and evaluating intervention strategies that target these risk factors, and taking steps to ensure that proven strategies are implemented in communities nationwide. Currently, NCIPC has developed and launched a pilot training course for the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Public Health (PH) Curriculum: "Forging a More Powerful Relationship." This notice is for market research purposes to determine the availability of potential vendors that can provide six (6) one-day Emergency Medical Services and Public Health training sessions at sites within the continental United States. The primary focus of the training is in the area of injury prevention. The goal of the training is to strengthen collaborative partnerships between EMS and the Public Health community. The objectives of the proposed program are to enable senior and mid-level managers of EMS and the Public Health community at the regional, state and local levels to know the names, contact information, and responsibilities of key players in EMS and Public Health within their communities; to better understand the missions, roles and daily activities of EMS and Public Health, and their respective impact on the communities they serve. Describe ways in which EMS and Public Health services/agencies can support one another and work together to better accomplish both missions with special emphasis on injury prevention. Identify opportunities for enhanced collaboration and next steps for shared action. The core tasks and minimum contractor requirements shall include: 1)Fully schedule, make accomodations, administer and facilitate six (6) one day skill building training sessions for EMS and PH practitioners within the continental U.S. 2) Demonstrate knowledge and expertise in event planning and conference support. 3) Demonstrate knowledge and expertise in designing and implementing an evaluation protocol. 4) Demonstrate knowledge of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and Public Health (PH) operational processes. 5) Demonstrate adequate qualified personnel to successfully perform the work activities by the required dates. 6) Demonstrate ability to record meeting minutes and synthesize proceedings to develop reports. 7) identify familiarity with CDC programmatic processes. 8) Provide public health experience in the field of injury control. All responsible sources are welcome to submit a written capability statement demonstrating their ability to perform the aforementioned technical requirements. CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST DEMONSTRATE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED ABOVE. Capability statements shall also include: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, business size and status. Please limit your capability statement document to no more than ten (10) pages.&nbsp; The NAICS code for this requirement is 813920. Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statement via email to plw9@cdc.gov. The subject line of the email shall be "EMS abd PH Curriculum Training Capability Statement". Capability statements will not be accepted after June 16, 2008.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Original description below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of NanoThermal Interfaces (NTI).  The primary goal of this program is the development and demonstration of ideas based on novel materials and structures that can provide significant reductions in the thermal resistance of the interface layer (often called the TIM) between the backside of an electronic device and the next layer of the package, which might be a spreader or a heatsink (this might be based on technologies developed in the DARPA-sponsored TGP and/or MACE programs, respectively).  In addition to reductions in the thermal resistance of the TIM, DARPA is interested in practical considerations, such as reliability, the ability to rework the interface, and application at modest temperatures and in conventional environments.  Additionally, DARPA is interested in concepts which can provide very high thermal conduction in the direction between the device and the spreader, while allowing shear due to differential thermal expansion between the device and spreader.  All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail is preferred.  (BAA08-42@darpa.mil) . See attached full BAA.</p>

Description
DESCRIPTION OF PROPOSED WORK:  The Government is seeking a qualified contractor to construct a new U.S. Port of Entry, Portal, North Dakota to replace the original border station built in 1932.  POE requires significant expansion and total replacement of the existing facility to meet current safety, security, circulation and efficiency standards.  The work consists of two main phases; Phase I construction services for construction of a new 70,000 gross square foot facility and Phase II construction work consists of a new 10,000 square foot Border Patrol Building and ancillary buildings totaling approximately 29,000 square feet.  Phase I and Phase II construction will increase the site size from 1.5 to 11.5 acres, expanding the current border station inspection lanes and provide other expanded border station functions, incorporating new exit and entry requirements developed by the Department of Homeland Security.  

If negotiations result in a final price for Phase II construction within Congressional funding limits, the Government intends to exercise the option for Phase II construction pending availability of funds.  The statutory limit for funding of the base contract and Phase I options is $18,000,000.  Any offers above that amount will be rejected.  If the negotiation efforts do not render a final price for Phase II construction within available funding, the Government will not exercise the option for Phase II construction.

Solicitation No. GS-08P-08-JF-C-0005 





DOCUMENT SECURITY
NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS




This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. 

REASONABLE CARE: 

1.   Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.   

Note:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.   

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below: 

Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary: 

      (a)        A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.   The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor?s license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and 

      (b)        Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov/, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and 

      (c)        A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary, 

     (d)        A Valid picture state driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above. 

2.   Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD?s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. 

3.    Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 

4.    Written agreement of disposal.  For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor?s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. 

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation. 

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>The purpose of this requirement is to provide the full complement of services required, including volunteers, qualified personnel, material, equipment and facilities in which to study the biology of influenza viruses in humans, to examine the host's immune response to these viruses, and to test and evaluate new candidate vaccines for safety, genetic stability, immunogenicity, transmissibility and protective efficacy in humans. Studies will also include the safe administration of wild-type virus to healthy adult volunteers in order to assess pathogenicity, virulence and their suitability for use as a challenge virus in efficacy studies. These wild-type viruses will be used to challenge vaccinated adult volunteers in order to assess the extent of immunity induced by candidate vaccines.
Studies will include both adult and pediatric subjects since influenza viruses cause severe respiratory disease in people of all ages. In summary, the requirement is to provide the necessary populations to study the biology and immunology of a variety of influenza viruses and serve as a testing center for the development of new vaccines effective against these agents.

NIAID intends to award a five-year contract with five (5) one-year options. This is not a Request for Proposals. The intention of this announcement is to notify potential offerors that the Request for Proposals will be available for download on May 22, 2008 from www.fedbizopps.gov.
