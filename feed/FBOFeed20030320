<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for renewal of annual I-DEAS software maintenance agreement.	NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Unigraphics Solutions, Inc., who is the only known responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements. The I-DEAS software is used for computer generated modeling and anlaysis of structural systems.  The annual renewal of the maintenance support is required to continue receiving regular updates as new versions of the software are released; access to technical support; prompt notification of bugs, and new documentation as it is published.  It would take substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer a similar product that would meet this requirement, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 4, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

Provide 2’-0” wide access grates with three steel hinges and hasp at locations indicated on the plan.  Where irregularities in the existing wall prevents flush mounting of steel angles, fill spaces between angles and wall with non-shrink grout.

<DESC>The Preclinical Research and Development Branch (PRDB), Vaccine and Prevention Research Program (VPRP), Division of AIDS (DAIDS), has a requirement for vaccine and non-vaccine prevention modelity production, non-clinical testing and regulatory document compilation.  It is anticipated that one contract will be awarded for a period of five years.  

The development of vaccines to prevent the spread of HIV infection and assist biodefense (BD) efforts is among the NIAID’s highest priorities.  Likewise, there is a critical need to promote the development of novel microbicides for prevention of sexual transmission of HIV, particularly in the absence of an effective, or even partially effective vaccine.  In addition, vaccines administered to infected individuals have potential for inducing immune control of the infectious agent.  While advances in immunology and molecular biology continue to offer an expanding array of approaches for the development of new products, there is limited capacity to move promising concepts through the development process.  In order to supplement limited industry involvement in developing vaccines, microbicides, and other non-vaccine prevention modalities, the NIAID requires a nontraditional, proactive and developmentally oriented program to provide preclinical development support for promising candidates when such candidates emerge from investigator-initiated research studies.  The NIAID will use a Master Contract for Preclinical Development to more rapidly and efficiently close development and production gaps.  Directly or through subcontractors and/or consultants, this contract will function in the following five major areas: Project Management; Process Development and Production; Safety, Immunogenicity and Spectrum of Activity Testing; Regulatory Documentation; and Information Technology and Data Management.

It is anticipated that a single cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a period of five (5) years, beginning in April 2004. RFP NIH-NIAID-DAIDS-04-23 will be available electronically on or about April 7, 2003, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract --and will also be posted on FedBizOpps. Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>NA The US Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Acquisition Center-Washington, on behalf of the CECOM Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Countermine Division, Humanitarian Demining Team, plans to negotiate a sole source contrac t with NIITEK Corporation, VA to evaluate the Wichmann 1.2-meter antenna's performance against both metallic and low-metallic AP mines and to assess whether this radar has potential to meet the Humanitarian Demining (HD) needs. The NIITEK GPR uses the Wich mann 1.2-meter antenna and was designed and developed by NIITEK Corporation under the Army program to detect primary antitank (AT) mines and has shown promising results in detecting the AT mines.  Because the HD environment requires clearing minefields con taining AP mines as well as AT mines, it is important to evaluate the antenna's capability against AP mines.   Under this effort, the contractor shall be tasked to perform the following tasks: 1) Integrate Wichmann antenna onto a robotic platform for data acquisition; 2) Acquire data with the Wichmann antenna over low-metal antipersonnel mines and develop algorithms for detecting these mines in the radar data; 3) Integrate the test results into the design of a prototype mine detection system according to re quirements suitable for humanitarian demining; and 4) Develop and build a prototype system consisting of a 1.2 meter wide GPR based detection system based on the NIITEK-Wichmann radar array design that can be used over mild terrain to detect AT and AP mine s for Humanitarian Demining efforts.   In addition, the contractor shall be tasked to conduct a research effort in developing a faster antenna.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1); Only One Responsible So urce and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  The resultant contract will be cost plus fixed price.  All requests for further information must be in writing and via email, telephone requests for additional information will not b e honored. You may forward responses to the following e-mail address: peggy.melanson@cacw.army.mil.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NA The Coastal Systems Station (CSS), Dahlgren Division, NSWC, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit TSE International Incorporated, 5301 Shreveport-Blanchard Highway, Shreveport, LA 71107 on a sole Source basis for one each Powered Reel Stand, TSE Model 18 132 x 115.  The reel stand must deliver 90,000 In-Lbs of torque while handling an 18,000-pound reel measuring 132 inches in diameter and 115 inches in width.  The reel stand is designed for quick change of the reel without tools.  The reel employs a post-type level-wind, caliper brake, and can pay out or pay in the cable.  The reel stand operates on diesel fuel and is designed to withstand the weather of the Texas coastline.  The reel stand is not permanently mounted and can be moved with a forklift.  There are also lifting eyes to facilitate moving the reel stand with a crane.  TSE Powered Reel Stand is the result of sever al difficult redesigns of previous models.  This model reel stand required extensive testing, redesign, and modifications to meet the Navy’s unique Field repair requirement.  An alternate manufacturer will have to duplicate TSE’s design and development effort, which would significantly increase the cost of the stand.  Delivery will be to the Coastal Systems Station ten (10) weeks from date of contract award, 6703 W. Highway 98, Panama City, FL 32407-7001.  NAICS Code 333120 applies.

This is in part due to a shift in the demands for in-use surveillance test programs, as the population of vehicles originally certified on large-roll dynamometers age to the point where they become of interest to our in-use programs. In order to provide optimum measurement capability suited to this shift in our test programs, EPA is planning to adapt the Horiba CDTCS/MEXA ? sampling and analytical system dedicated to D004, a twin 8.65" inch roll dynamometer, to also collect sample from D005, a single 48" roll dynamometer.  EPA believes this can be accomplished in a straightforward manner, extending the capability of the existing modern, capable and robust system. The existing system contains proprietary Horiba Instruments software and equipment.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability and respond to the office identified above. Documentation must be received by April 3, 2003 in order to be considered by the EPA. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon assessment of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested parties should submit a written response to Emily Marcil by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail Maril.Emily@epa.gov to receive consideration for this contract. Telephone responses will not be honored.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the State Climate Office (SCO) of North Carolina in Raleigh, NC 27695, for Meteorological Measurements and Modeling in Support of Human Exposure Modeling in the Research Triangle Park, NC (RTP). The SCO has been developing and evaluating a local-scale meteorological modeling system for the RTP area of North Carolina and supports the integration within EPA's developing Human Exposure Source to Dose Models.  This research supports the EPA's human exposure modeling  for air toxics development and will be transferable to other places.  During FY00 and FY01, the SCO supported the collection of meteorological data using EPA's human portable SODAR's and Tower systems.  The SCO maintains a meteorological monitoring network throughout North Carolina that supplements  the measurements collected by EPA systems and are critical in providing measurements to support performance evaluation of the meteorological models.  During FY02, the SCO supported the collection of meteorological measurements near the NY World Trade Center (WTC) recovery site.  The SCO also  applied the meteorological modeling methods linked to the CALMET-CALPUFF air dispersion modeling system that was under development for North Carolina to time critical studies in support of EPA studies of the potential pollution plume for the NY WTC recovery site.  Also, the SCO staff have the  expertise on meteorological instrumentation and measurements, which can assist the EPA in evaluating and recommending a strategy for future validation studies.  This contract is critical to finalizing the databases and modeling applications that are ongoing by the SCO.    Objective:  The specific  objective for this project shall be to complete databases and modeling applications using collected data and model developments made during FY01 and FY02.  These applications are for both North Carolina and New York City for local-scale linkage to support human exposure modeling.  Measurements from  EPA's meteorological measurement systems and the SCO meteorological measurement systems shall be used to support an evaluation of the meteorological model linkage to the local scale.  Additional meteorological measurements shall be made during this contract period in the RTP area.    Scope of Work:   The following tasks support Meteorological Measurements and Modeling in Support of Human Exposure Modeling in the RTP Area.  Task 1.  Meteorological Modeling System Evaluation, Set Up and Application:  The North Carolina State Climate Office (SCO) shall apply and evaluate the performance of  local-scale meteorological models covering the RTP and New York City areas for selected time periods in FY01 and FY02.   The SCO shall demonstrate how to set up meteorological  models interfaced with routine measurement sites and routine National Weather Service model output and linked to air  dispersion models.  Meteorological measurements collected during FY01 and FY02 will be processed and used to support the evaluation studies.  Reports of progress leading to scientific peer reviewed journal publications shall be prepared.  The final report shall be a compilation of draft papers  prepared for journal publication.  Task 2.  Meteorological Measurements.  The North Carolina State Climate Office (SCO) shall operate and coordinate meteorological measurements from the EPA systems and the SCO meteorological sites. The SCO shall coordinate and report meteorological measurements in  a format that supports the model development/evaluation studies in Task 1 and used to support future application.  Meteorological measurements shall be made according to  "Standard Operating Procedures for the US EPA Meteorological Instrumentation Cluster. Revision #1.0 Date: 12/01".    A final  report summarizing activities and data collected shall be prepared to cover the project period. Deliverables:  Progress reports on previous meteorological data for the RTP area with supporting modeling  shall be prepared to cover the periods identified in the Statement of Work.  Final reports of  compiled papers drafted for peer review journal publications and for summarizing activities and data collected.  The performance period is for eight months from date of award.  The place of performance is located in Research Triangle Park, NC.  The North American Industry Classification System  (NAICS) Code 541990, which has a small business size standard of $5.0 million, is applicable.   All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  No Solicitation is  available.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any additional source (s) exist and, therefore, no Request for Proposal (RFP) is available.  Consequently, any response (s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy  of the RFP will be ignored.  Submit response no later than 04 April 2003 to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Joy Kimble, RTP-POD, (MC-E105-02),  Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 or you may email your response to kimble.joy@epa.gov.

<DESC>POC: James S. Perretta, AFRL/SNRT Program Manager, 315-330-2632,  (James.Perretta@rl.af.mil); John Rooks, AFRL/IFTC Project Engineer, 315 330-2618,   (john.rooks@rl.af.mil); Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Arnold J. Kloven, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-4767, email: Arnold.Kloven@rl.af.mil.  The AFRL Sensors and Information Directorates at the Rome Research Site, Rome NY, in collaboration with Air Force Space & Missile Center (SMC) Los Angeles CA, are soliciting proposals for innovative approaches towards an enhanced architecture for On-Board Processing (OBP) of Space-Based Radar (SBR) for Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI), Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR), and Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) modes.  This is a four-year open-ended Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA) to solicit Research and Development (R & D) proposals for the Space-Based Radar technology development project, in an effort to allow us to reach Transition Readiness Level 5 (TRL-5) by Fiscal Year 2006. The goal of SBR operation for GMTI, SAR, and DTED detection of tactical targets from space promises great advantages to the warfighter. However, the technical challenges in achieving this goal are substantial. This is especially true for reliable, cost-effective, real-time OBP in a space environment; where OBP is defined here as: digital beamforming, adaptive jammer and clutter cancellation, image formation processing, target detection, and data formatting for transmission over tactical data links.  In order to reduce risk on ongoing SBR programs, be technically achievable, affordable and reliable, the Air Force needs to reduce technical risk by developing severable hardware and software architectures that are proven from the perspectives of performance, schedule, cost and on-orbit maintainability.  The following areas of research and development have been identified as important risk factors for developing an extensible open architecture SBR OBP:  1. A multi-processor architecture that combines power efficiency, real-time performance, fault-tolerance, reliability, and cost-effective programming. 2.  A radiation tolerant/hard design suitable for development, testing, and qualification in a representative space radiation environment, to include detection of single event upsets and minimizing their impact on operational performance.  3.  The ability to migrate to new technologies so that the contracted R&D efforts can be efficiently and cost-effectively transitioned to future space surveillance systems, and updated with the latest technology before integration into an operational system. 4.  An open interface, as demonstrated by integration with existing SBR ESA/OBP contractors under the Space & Missile Command (SMC) PRDA (Reference YS03-01).  5.  The design, development, validation and implementation of GMTI, SAR, and DTED real time processing algorithms, including the interrelation of the algorithms, processing and the tactical datalink.  6.  The verification of techniques for Space Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) to the extent necessary to reduce the effects of clutter and electromagnetic interference, on the efficient detection of fixed and moving tactical targets. There should be no proprietary Rights claimed for the computer architecture, hardware, software, algorithms or associated supporting infrastructure.   Government purpose license rights or other rights that allow unrestricted Government and Government Contractor access to the design information are required for the hardware and software.  This includes any hardware description language such as VHDL or Verilog and all software used in or to support this development.  Integrated Circuit (IC) layouts may be based on proprietary cell libraries.  (They are considered less valuable due to the limited life expectancy of a given IC layout.)  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOLICITATION.  Offerors are required to submit five (5) copies of a seventy-five (75) page (maximum) technical proposal and a cost proposal (no page limitation) with a cover letter .  The technical proposal will be formatted as follows:  Section A:  Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B:  Task Objective; Section C:  Technical Summary, Section D: Technical Description.  Offerors must mark their proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609.  All technical and cost proposals submitted in responses to this PRDA must be addressed to ATTN: James S. Perretta, Reference PRDA 03-03-IFKA, AFRL/SNRT, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY 13441-4514. Proposals should be submitted both on paper and in electronic format (Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat Read format).  Offerors are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submission as well as a fax number, and an e-mail address.  Proposals may be submitted at either the unclassified or SECRET level.  Proposals will not be accepted at levels above SECRET. Prospective offerors are encouraged to submitted proposals within thirty (30) days of the date of publication of this notice.  Proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  Individual proposal evaluations will be based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other proposals submitted under the announcement.  It is recommended that proposals be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award; FY03 – see above; FY04 - 30Jun03; FY05 – 30 Jun04.  Proposals will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each fiscal year after the dates cited.  Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria:  (1)  Innovation of the proposed effort.  The degree to which the proposed effort presents a new approach to achieving the SBR goals.  This could involve the clever use of existing technology or where necessary, the development of new technologies to control total system cost while maximizing performance.  (2)  Potential Contributions to SBR.  The potential impact of the proposed effort to the SBR mission.  (3) Scalability and Adaptability.  The ability of the proposed architecture to incorporate changing SBR requirements.  As throughput requirements and algorithms changes occur, the proposed design should have the flexibility to incorporate these changes. (4)  Cost.  The reasonableness and realism of the proposed costs and fees.  (5) Other Factors.  Consideration of other factors, such as past and present performance on recent Government contracts, related experience in the area of space & radar systems design and the capacity and capability to perform the requirements of the effort.
An informational briefing/industry day is not planned.  The Government anticipates awarding a single thirty-six (36) month contract in FY 03 for an estimated $5.5M.   The cost proposal should be predicated on a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF/completion) pricing arrangement. Proposed costs shall be identified by element of cost and include the basis of estimate and detailed supporting rationale.   Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  Additional contracts may be awarded in FY 04 and beyond as needs are identified, e.g., interface testing, risk reduction, etc..  The cost of preparing proposals in response this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract. Principal funding of this PRDA and the anticipated award of contracts will start in FY03. FY 03 awards are anticipated to be approximately $5.5 M each. Total funding for this PRDA is approximately $23.0M. Awards of efforts as a result of this PRDA will be in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending upon the nature of the work proposed.  All responsible firms may submit a proposal, which shall be considered. Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures.  Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point, Arnold J. Kloven, Contracting Officer, telephone (315) 330-4767 or e-mail Arnold.Kloven@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding.  The e-mail must reference the title and PRDA 03-03-IFKA.  Questions, clarification, or concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition should be communicated directly to the IFKA Contracting Officer, Arnold Kloven, telephone (315) 330-4767 or e-mail Arnold.Kloven@rl.af.mil.  The email must reference the title and solicitation number of the acquisition.  A copy of the Rome "BAA& PRDA: A Guide for Industry," Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<ARCHDATE>03192004
<CONTACT>Mary E. Coleman Contract Specialist 7037871353     Mary.Coleman@mms.gov;
<DESC>**UPDATED INFORMATION REGARDING DATES AND REQUIRED SUBMISSIONS**  As stated in the prior FedBizOps announcement, the Department of Interior (DOI)/GovWorks is seeking potential contractors to provide a solution which will allow the processing of invoices electronically, hereinafter referred to as "e-invoicing".  The e-invoicing shall be posted and processed through GovWorks' Business Information System (BIS), and ABACIS, our financial accounting system.  GovWorks currently processes some 1,200 to 1,500 invoices per month for approximately 500 vendors.  This is a labor and paper intensive environment.  GovWorks' invoice approval process involves the attention and participation of several different entities.  These entities include the vendor, procurement assistants, the COTR, the CO and the Finance department for disbursement of payments.  In order to implement a successful e-invoicing solution, the system must provide 24 hour x 7 day accessibility to all entities involved.  This requirement is being issued by GovWorks under the franchise authority of the Department of the Interior (DOI) in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  This competitive process will be simplified in order to facilitate the acquisition process and prevent undue administrative burden upon the Contractor(s) and the Government. The Government anticipates releasing the questions and answers, via the GovWorks web site, http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp, no later than FRIDAY, MARCH 28, 2003.  Please be advised that the Government reserves the right to transmit those questions and answers of a common interest to all prospective Offerors.  In order to compete for this acquisition interested parties MUST demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by providing a Capabilities Statement which is due no later than 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, FRIDAY, APRIL 4,  2003.  The Government will review and evaluate the experience and capability of your organization and proposed project team as demonstrated by the information supplied in this submittal.  All Offerors must submit an electronic copy in Microsoft Word plus one (1) original hard copy to the Contracting Officer at the address specified in this notice.  Your Capabilities Statement should provide information detailing: (1) your key personnel and program manager (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the work) with their qualifications and specific experience within the electronic invoicing environment; (2) your organizational experience within the electronic invoicing environment; and (3) specific references (including contract number &  project description, period of performance, dollar amount, client identification with point of contact & telephone number) for previous  related work within the electronic invoicing environment that your key personnel or organization have performed within the last two years.  If you believe the Government may find derogatory information as a result of checking your past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action taken by your organization to address the problem.  After review of all Capabilities Statements, those offerors deemed "Best Qualified" will be provided additional proposal instructions and contract requirements.  Your Capabilities Statement will be evaluated based on  your key persons' skills, abilities and experience within the electronic invoicing environment; your organization's experience and past performance (including number, size, and complexity of similar projects, technical excellence, adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of program management, willingness to cooperate when difficulties arise, willingness to partner with the Government in providing robust solutions, general compliance with the terms of the contracts, and acceptability of delivered product and service rendered.)

<DESC>NA This is a MODIFICATION to a previous notice first published in FedBizOpps on 28 Jan 03 under solicitation #DAAD16-03-T-0000, subject as shown above.  The purpose of this notice is to UPDATE and CHANGE some of the information in that notice.  The first upda te is to CANCEL #DAAD16-03-T-0000 and ADD #DAAD16-03-R-0014 which will act as the true solicitation number for this acquisition.  In the 28 Jan 03 notice it was stated that this procurement would be a 'commercial purchase order utilizing simplified acquisi tion procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5.'  This procurement WILL NOT be a commercial procurement, thus the solicitation and all requirements associated with it shall be done in accordance with FAR Part 15.  Originally the 'quotation' was estimated  to be released 'on or about February 21st'.  The new estimated date for release of this 'proposal' is 28 March 2003.  Offers will be due thirty (30) calendar days after the release date of the request for proposal (note the above due date is an estimate).   The final CHANGE is the point of contact (POC) for this effort.  The new POC is Ms. Tammy Taylor, Contracting Officer, and all inquiries regarding this solicitation shall be submitted to her attention at email Tammy.Taylor@natick.army.mil.  Once the  solicitation is released it will be avialable on the ASFI web site as well as the following:  https://www3.natick.army.mil.  No hard copies of the solicitation are anticipated to be distributed, however, if potential offerors would like to be notified as to when exactly the solicitation is released they should email Ms. Taylor at the address provided herein.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is stated below.  Please be aware of the new due date for this RFP which is April 11, 2003.   1.	Section M.8 delete the words “and offeror’s proposed cancellation ceilings.” 2.	Section B, add a line so that 0002AA and 0002AB are each priced. 3.	Section B, 0003 is priced as total, not per order or option. 4.	Section B, add a line so that 0004 can be priced. 5.	Section B, Proposed prices are not required for items 0006,0008,0010,0011,0013,0014,0015 and 0016. They are only to show the ranges. 6.	Section J, Contract Data Requirements (A008) referenced as Technical Report Study/ Services should read “Government Furnished Material (GFM) Consumption Report” as specified in C.3.8. 7.	The capability of the contractors AIE to measure to the .005 the base gap requirement in the M795 specification will be evaluated against the contractor meeting the specification requirements set forth in section 4 of the specification for film radiography. This includes submitting film that clearly shows that the 2T holes in each IQI (penetrameter) are clearly identifiable at the specified location. The contractor would be required to reject any discernable base separation unless they can prove that they can accurately assess base separations less than .005".   All proposed digital x-ray systems must be proven to be as good or better than film radiography for all defect types. 8.	RFP due date is extended to 11 April 2003 at 4 pm EST. 9.	Reference NOR R1A2050, document # 9312769  a.	Has change in cyclic conditioning profile been performed under production? Utilizing thermocoupled projectiles in the post cycle heat oven(s) has been performed in a production environment by a government contractor.  They are used to balance the temperatures throughout the oven(s) as well as calibrate the process to assure the Government that the post cycle heat equipment/process established by the contractor, provides the necessary minimum/maximum temperatures are achieved for the minimum time requirement. b.	Does the Govt have a profile of transition times, volume of airflow? The TDP contains sufficient information for contractors to develop a post cycle conditioning process. Profile information is not available. c.	Is .005”correct limit for measuring base gap? If so, why was it changed from .015” to .005”?  The correct measurement is .005 inches.  Wording was changed from “no discernable base separation” to “the maximum allowable base separation shall be .005 inches” when inspected by x-ray.  The reason for this change was because below .005 inches, it is difficult to discern utilizing conventional x-ray technology, if base separation is present. 10.	Will the specially designed Government owned M795 DR radiography equipment be made available to any successful contractor as GFE? Will M795 DR inspection system specifications, capabilities and throughput be made available? The capability of the contractors AIE, whether by digital or film radiography, to measure to the .005 the base gap requirement in the M795 specification will be evaluated against the contractor meeting the specification requirements set forth in section 4 of the specification for film radiography. This includes submitting film that clearly shows that the 2T holes in each IQI (penetrameter) is clearly identifiable at the specified location. The contractor would be required to reject any discernable base separation unless they can prove that they can accurately assess base separations less than .005".   All proposed digital x-ray systems must be proven to be as good or better than film radiography for all defect types. The Digital X-ray System has not undergone final acceptance or been proven in full rate production, therefore, the capabilities and throughput are not available. Final acceptance of the system is anticipated in FY03. Upon final acceptance, title for a portion of the system will be retained by JMC under the facility use contract.  However, some of the system was not funded by the US Government, but was funded by American Ordnance and is not US Government property and title remains with AO.  After acceptance, this system will be in use supporting additional military programs in addition to the M795, and therefore, will not be available as GFE for use at another location.  Also, it would not be practical or cost effective to physically disassemble and move an incomplete system, lacking hardware and software, computers, scanners, printers, shields, weldments, doors, lids, conveyors and power supply from IAAAP to another facility. 11.	   Will freight be GBL or priced by offeror? Per F.5 FAR 52.247-29 FOB Origin, a GBL will be prepared. 12.	 Section C.3.3.6. Is the list of process parameters required, or the actual SOP? Will actual SOP changes be approved by PCO prior to implementation, or granted for the changes that result in a change to the SOP? The PPDs will be a list of the process parameters, procedures and equipment used along with the SOPs. The PPDs/SOPs will be approved prior to the FAT and the PCO must then be notified of the proposed changes or modifications before implementing any change/modification to the PPDs/SOPs.

C. SHALL REMAIN IN SYNC.   SEE THE MODIFIED ANNOUNCEMENT WHICH INCORPORATES THESE CHANGES. The Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Tactical Data Links System Program Office (TDL SPO) is seeking sources to continue the iLinks development effort.  The TDL SPO intends to solicit sources with existing GSA Schedule contracts to meet the government's requirements.  iLinks is an integrated digital environment that allows TDL users security role based access to a host of TDL information.  The TDL SPO would like to leverage off what has been accomplished with iLinks to date as well as leveraging off other Internet programs at the center.  The objective of this program is to build on these tools and to continue applying Internet-type capabilities to AF requirements.   It should provide a basis for automating, standardizing, and coordinating processes within the TDL SPO while integrating with other ESC Program Offices.  It is intended to migrate and expand the results of the current iLinks website to include a classified Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) site.  The classified SIPRNET site and the Unclassified but Sensitive Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) site with the exception of the classified material that cannot be displayed on the NIPRNET site.  It is also intended that the products of this development will consist of Commercial Off The Shelf software (COTS) whenever possible.  iLinks shall support, as a minimum a set of capabilities to include: Use of Web-enabled browser interface management to streamline access to TDL and platform Program Office information on a worldwide basis; efficient access to legacy information data stores; combine and manipulate data from multiple data sources and post results in configurable display formats, provide community of interest rule based participation, integrate all existing requirements from the requirements document attached while helping to define and integrate new requirements, and provide these capabilities in both the NIPRNET and SIPRNET domains.  The successful offeror will also assist in identifying, and enhancing all platform Program Offices' processes and business rules.  The recommendation will include an estimate of the magnitude of the requirements.  The offeror will build upon existing requirements to automate processes and business rules that have been developed during the first and second iterations of iLinks.   The web product needs to be interoperable with several other database applications throughout the DoD, it shall build upon the role based security already developed, there shall be a duplicate application on the SIPRNET, and the product shall be user friendly, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing.  The product needs to be built as an open architecture allowing data to be edited by users based on their security levels.  The software needs to be developed on an Oracle database.  The contract will be based on a spiral development schedule to incrementally enhance the functionality of the site.  The period of performance will a base period of eighteen (18) months with two (2) one year options.   Responses are due within thirty (30) days of the publication of the initial notice.  All interested sources should contact Mr. Jeffrey Wong by e-mail at Jeffrey.Wong@hanscom.af.mil . Be advised that all interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database in order to receive an award and hold current GSA Schedule contracts that offer services and supplies to meet the government's requirements.  If you are not registered in the CCR Database you may request an application at (888) 227-2423 or through the CCR website http://www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>This is a modification to a previous notice

The following information is provided as clarification of the financial information contained in section 12.f of the MIND PRDA:  The Government estimates that a single contract would cost $6.97M (million dollars) to perform all program activities and phases.  The Government anticipates that $9.74M in funding may be available for the MIND contract, which is $2.77M more than the single contract estimate.  Therefore, the MIND program has been structured for up to two contracts during Phase 1 at an estimated cost of $2.77M each and a single contract for Phases 2 and 3 at an estimated cost of $4.2M.  The annual levels stated in section 12.f of the MIND PRDA are based on the anticipated funding available during each FY (Government Fiscal Year, October through September).  Maximum use of the funding available in each FY is desired, but funds can be used in the subsequent year if necessary.  The funding amount in FY03 is quite large, therefore the Government does not expect it to be completely used during FY03.  Also, the duration of Phase 1 is expected to extend into FY05, however, FY05 funds are not anticipated to be allocated to Phase 1 activities.  Therefore, FY04 funds should be used to perform Phase 1 activities conducted in FY05.  A funding shortfall currently exists in FY05 and FY06.  The Government has approximately $7.4M in total funding for the MIND contracts, which is short of the $9.74M needed.  The Government expects to start the MIND program while continuing to address this funding issue.  This shall not be interpreted as an obligation on the part of the Government to fund the MIND program at the stated annual or total levels.

<DESC>This is a modification to combined synopsis/solicitation number RS-ADM-03-161. 
The combined synopsis/solicitation number RS-ADM-03-161 is amended as set forth below.  NOTE: THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY AMENDMENT TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION.  A WRITTEN AMENDMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The hour and date specified for receipt of responses remains 3/28/03 at 3:00 p.m. local time.  Offers must acknowledge receipt of this amendment on each copy of the offer submitted or by separate letter or telegram which includes a reference to the combined synopsis/solicitation number and the amendment number 3. Response to vendor technical questions will be responded to during the week of 3/24/2003.  Revision to the receipt of responses date will be addressed at that time.  The above numbered combined synopsis/solicitation is amended to: (1) correct the pricing schedule information under OPTION PERIOD ONE for CLIN 0016, CLIN 0017, CLIN 0018, AND CLIN 0019 to accurately reflect the item descriptions and  the estimated quantities. Pricing for all option periods should be the same; and (2) respond to vendor non-technical questions resulting from the walk-through at the NRC building in Rockville, Maryland on March 13, 2003.  Accordingly, ADM-03-161 is amended as follows:  

(1) CLINs 0016, 0017, 0018, and 0019 under OPTION PERIOD ONE is deleted entirely and the following is substituted in-lieu thereof:  

CLIN 0016) CONVERSION of each LIVE broadcast into ARCHIVED format within 24-hours for each full half-hour of the actual meeting that was held - does not include time for pre-meeting testing (because it is not converted): QTY - 156, UNIT -  ½ hour,  Unit Price $____, Total Price $___;  
CLIN 0017) CONVERSION of each LIVE broadcast into ARCHIVED format on URGENT basis  within 4-hours for each full half-hour of the actual meeting that was held - does not include time for pre-meeting testing (because it is not converted): QTY - 4, UNIT -  ½ hour,  Unit Price $____, Total Price $___;    
CLIN 0018) CONVERSION of an NRC meeting from a VHS-tape into ARCHIVED format within 24-hours for each full half-hour of the actual meeting that was held: QTY - 4, UNIT -  ½ hour,  Unit Price $____, Total Price $___;  
CLIN 0019) CONVERSION of an NRC meeting from a VHS-tape into ARCHIVED format on an URGENT basis within 4-hours for each full half-hour of the actual meeting that was held: QTY - 4, UNIT -  ½ hour,  Unit Price $____, Total Price $___;  

(2)  Following are responses to questions: 

QUESTION#1: The solicitation is listed as a small business set aside.  You mentioned Streampipe at the tour.  Since they have been purchased by Loudeye, a large publicly owned corporation on the stock exchange, will they be one of the competing vendors?  Can we get a list of competing vendors?
 RESPONSE#1: Large business may not participate in this solicitation as a prime.  Proposals for this requirement may be submitted only by small businesses, and small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.  Under this solicitation, we do not have a list of competing vendor until a proposal is submitted. After receipt of proposals the vendor list becomes procurement sensitive information which is not released to the public during the acquisition process.


QUESTION#2:  The announcement states that proposals are to be delivered by 12:00 Noon on March 12, 2003 (Now 3:00pm March 28, 2003). The announcement also states that: "All offerors shall allow extra time for internal mail distribution." Can you provide an idea of how much "extra time" to allow?  Should we deliver our bid by 3:30 PM the night before, March 11? At 7:30 AM
on March 12? At 9:30 AM on March 12? I will hand deliver the proposal to NRC on March 28,2003. What is the process and time required to insure that we are in compliance with the due
date?
RESPONSE#2: For all hand-carried proposals including those delivered by private delivery services, we would recommend thirty (30) to sixty (60) minutes "extra time" for mail handling, due to heightened security measures around government buildings.

QUESTION#3: The announcement states that "proposals shall not exceed 30 pages" and that "any pages beyond the first 50 will not be considered in the evaluation." Can you provide the precise page limit? Do we correctly assume that page limit applies only to the Technical Proposal and does not include the pricing information in the Cost Proposal?
RESPONSE#3:   Proposals shall not exceed 30 pages, inclusive of the past performance references (if both sides of a page are used, each side is counted as one page).  Any pages beyond the first 30 will not be considered in the evaluation.  All charts, graphs, and other information, inclusive of past performance information, will be counted in the page limitation.  Foldouts and sales brochures are prohibited. The page limitation applies to the technical proposal only.
QUESTION#4: Will price be evaluated for the initial year only or will price evaluation also include the four option years?

RESPONSE#4: Pricing for the base plus all four option periods will be evaluated.

QUESTION#5: Does NRC have a preferred format for response to the RFP?

RESPONSE#5: The offeror must submit the following material which will constitute its offer:  
(a)  Part 1 - Solicitation Package/Offer - Vendor transmittal letter signed by a duly authorized company representative which constitutes acceptance of the terms and conditions of the contract.
(b)  Part II -PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS -- TECHNICAL  -- Submit one (1) original and two (2) copies of the "Technical Proposal which addresses:  CORPORATE EXPERIENCE: The offeror shall discuss how well its proposal demonstrates corporate experience. Describe, in general terms, corporate qualifications and experience in performing the same or similar work as required in the SOW Section of this solicitation the firm and any of its proposed subcontractors have performed over the past five years.  Include the number of years the firm has been in business and company growth history (personnel and dollars).  List any current commitments with other organizations, Government and/or commercial, for the same or similar effort. PAST PERFORMANCE:  Offerors shall provide past performance information that includes recent and relevant information for a minimum of two contracts performed over the past five (5) years for efforts accomplished in similar size and scope to the NRC's effort.  This information shall include contract number, dollar value, point of contact with a current telephone number and a brief synopsis of the services performed.  
(c)  Part III - PROPOSAL REQUIREMENT - PRICING - Submit one (1) original and two (2) copies of the "Cost Proposal which includes completing the pricing schedule.  An offeror's cost proposal shall reflect all costs necessary to perform the work reflected in this effort.   The offeror shall submit an overall cost proposal for the entire period of performance (base period and option periods).
(d)  Part IV -REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS - Offeror must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3 (October 2000) Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer.

QUESTION#6:  Is there a particular standard form on which we should complete the provision at 52.212-3?  I've noted at www.arnet.gov/far what language must be included, but didn't know if there's an actual form to use or whether we should generate the elements of a form ourselves on our own letterhead, for example.
RESPONSE#6: The format for the certification is in FAR 52.212-3. There is not a separate form for this. Most offerors print a copy of the clause FAR 52.212-3 and complete the certification questions on the printed FAR clause. The marked-up FAR clause is submitted as the certification.  For example see paragraph (b) Taxpayer Identification Number of the clause. You will note that item number  (3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) shown below leaves a place to write in the TIN or circle the statement that applies.  "o  TIN: _____________________. 

QUESTION#7: Are there any forms or representations that we need to provide with our proposal that relate to FAR 52.212-5 and the additional applicable clauses, or to the INS compliance?  Or would any such forms or representations be required following award of contract instead?
RESPONSE#7: There are no forms to complete in relationship to FAR 52.212-5. By your firm submitting a proposal in which you do not take any exceptions to clause FAR 52.212-5 indicates that you are accepting the Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders- Commercial Items. There is nothing additional to submit with your proposal.

QUESTION#8:  Regarding RS-ADM-03-161, modification 4, amendment 2, there seems to be a minor discrepancy involving CLIN 0017 and Option Period One.  CLIN 0017 is a repeat of CLIN 0016.  There is no CLIN under Option Period One for "CONVERSION of an NRC meeting from a VHS-tape into ARCHIVED format on an URGENT basis within 4-hours for each full half-hour of the actual meeting that was held." Since such a CLIN exists in Base Period and Option periods Two, Three and Four, it would seem that a CLIN for such a service should be under Option Period One as well.
RESPONSE#8: See item number 1) of this amendment.


(3)   FAILURE OF YOUR ACKNOWLEDGMENT, TO BE RECEIVED AT THE PLACE DESIGNATED FOR THE RECEIPT OF OFFERS, PRIOR TO OR ON THE DATE AND HOUR SPECIFIED, MAY RESULT IN REJECTION OF YOUR OFFER. 

(4)  Nothing follows.

<DESC>******The following changes have been made due to discussions with contractors at the site visit.  In regards to a possible break in performance, a maximum of two contractor mobilizations will be required for this purchase.  the contractor shall begin work within five days of award and work diligently until completion of project.  Contractor will submit anticipated calendar days required to complete this project, weather permitting.  The Statement of Work has been revised to state that grinding the tree stumps is not required.  The government's requirement is that the area of 16.4 acres be cleared.  The contractor has the descretion in the method it will employ. However, a controlled burn of the area will not be permitted for this purchase. Additionally, the government requests that prices be quoted on a per acre price basis, along with a total purchase price.*******

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Solicitation FQ5004302901 is hereby issued as a Request for Quote. This solicitation document and all incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-06.
This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small businesses under NAICS code 339950, which has a small business size standard of 500 employees.
The requirement consists of the following, (CLIN #, Quantity and Unit of Issue, Description;) 1.  Scope.  Contractor shall provide and install signs used to identify the addresses of buildings located throughout Eielson AFB in accordance with the following specifications.  Eielson AFB is in the process of assigning new physical addresses to nearly every building--work centers, maintenance shops, hangars, homes, and office buildings--on the base.  To that end, nearly every building on the base shall be required to change existing address signage in favor of the new address.  Requirements for this SOW include signs to be attached to buildings, signs to be attached to existing and contractor-provided signs posts, and self-adhesive signs to be attached to existing signs.  Includes removal of existing signage.  Performance period extends from 15 Mar 03 to 15 May 03.  All signs must be installed and accepted by the government NLT 15 May 03, including any punch list items.  Specifications.  The contractor shall provide samples and submittals on all materials required in this SOW for approval.	
a.  All signs, except self-adhesive signs, shall be made from aluminum at a thickness of 0.080.	
b.  All signs shall be warranteed by the contractor against fading, delamination, and installation durability for a period of 5 years after installation.
c.  All signs, including self-adhesive signs, shall be white lettering on a dark brown background.	
d. Dark brown sheeting (see “c” above) shall be in the color of Hiway Brown or National Park Service Brown.
e. The majority of signs ordered shall require prismatic reflective sheeting presenting a high coefficient of retro reflection.  Reflectivity shall be visible through the dark brown layer.
f. Approximately 15 percent of required signs, including some self-adhesive signs, shall be Engineer Grade sheeting in the same dark brown.
g. All sign lettering shall be reverse die cut.  Screening, painting, or stick-on letters are not acceptable.
h. Sign lettering shall be Helvetica Medium or Helvetica Regular, with capitalization and lettering size verified at order.
i. Signs shall be installed on exterior walls made of concrete, CMU, metal, or Dry-Vit, or on existing and contractor-provided 2” X 2” sign posts.  Self-adhesive signs shall be installed on existing flat aluminum signage.
j. Contractor-provided sign posts shall be 2” X 2” square perforated steel tubing, approximately 12 feet in total length, in the color of dark brown, and shall include suitable solid steel base.
k. Method of installation shall be at the option of the contractor, however the installation method shall be durable, tamper and vandal proof, and shall match the color of the signs.  For example, if rivets are used as a mounting method, the visible portion of the rivets shall be dark brown as well.
l. Upon installation all signs shall be plumb and level at the correct height and be in the correct location.
m. Specific address numbers, maps, samples, and other related information shall be provided to the contractor at award.
The quantities and labor needed are listed below:	
1. Provide and install aluminum signs, NTE (not to exceed), 1260 SF (square feet).
What are the sizes (Height X Width) of the 1260 aluminum signs? REPLY: The signs will be different sizes. That's why we went with SF pricing. Some will be 6 inches X about 12 inches, some will be in the 14" X 36" range, others will be a few inches smaller or larger. There will be hundreds of each size, but there will be a handful of different sizes.
2. Provide and install self-adhesive signs, NTE, 250 SF.
What are the sizes of the 250 self-adhesive signs? REPLY: Same as the answer for above. Some will be small like 4" X 4", others will be about 6" X 36". Remember these are stickers, no metal.  Do the self-adhesive signs need to be dye stamped?  REPLY: Yes, all signs must be reverse die cut.    
3. Labor hours to remove existing signs, NTE, 167 EA.
What type and size are the signs to be removed and how are they installed. REPLY: They are installed on metal, CMU, and concrete walls using screws, molly bolts, rivets, studs, and probably glue. Their sizes are comparable to the new signs.
4. Provide and install new 2" X 2" sign posts, NTE, 5 EA.
Are the 2" X 2" steel posts with solid steel bases mounted to concrete?  Do we have to dig new footers and pour concrete? REPLY: The gov't will accept either concrete poured bases or bases that have been driven into the ground. Either are acceptable as long as the sign post is solid, plumb, and durable.
Is the background reflective white or another color. REPLY: The text letters are white. If they make them right, ie IAW para 2g of the SOW, reverse die cut will get them there.
It is my understanding that the white lettering should be reflective and the brown does not need to be?  REPLY: The white is the reflective and the reflectivity is visible through the brown.  So the brown is somewhat transparent, but still dark brown. Do the self-adhesive signs need to be dye stamped?  REPLY: Yes, all signs must be reverse die cut.  
Can you please clarify the square footage issue.   REPLY: The signs are provided by the square foot, not by "each".  Totals are NTE (not to exceed) (x-amount) SF for aluminum signs, NTE (x-amount) SF for self adhesive signs, NTE (x-amount) hours of labor for removal of old signs, and NTE (x-amount) each new sign posts.  Both types of signs and the sign posts include installation in their price.
Evaluation of offers will be performed on the basis of price.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to inform industry that of the change in the location of the Draft Performance Work Statements (PWS).  All Draft PWS documents will only be posted in FEDBIZOPS.  They will no longer be hosted on a separate web site.


This is a REQUEST FOR COMMENT ON A DRAFT PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT.  A cost comparison study is being conducted of the National Logistic Support Center located in Kansas City, Missouri. 
It is a component of the U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NOAA Finance and Administration (NFA), Central Administrative Support Center (CASC).  

The NLSC is an entirely reimbursable cost center. It is funded through Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) or Intra-Agency Agreements with its Customer organizations. Currently, NLSC has six Customers; four are NOAA entities: National Weather Service (NWS), NOAA Finance and Administration (NFA), the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and the National Ocean Service (NOS). The other two are the Animal, Plant, and Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Earth (GLOBE) Program under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

The release of this draft PWS is the first step to meet the requirements. Prior to DOC/NOAA undertaking the full acquisition process, we intend to determine if our needs can be met as presented below. Firms who believe they can meet our needs are requested to respond to this Request for Comments (RFC). Comments should address the PWS and each functional area. Your response to the PWS should coincide with the numbering identifiable to the paragraph numbering contained below. Comments will only be used to determine if we should proceed with a procurement action and for the refinement of current draft specification. The Government shall not pay for any information, literature, demonstration, etc., provided to the Government as a result of this RFC. 

Responses must be submitted electronically, and to the attention of Joel Perlroth, Contracting Officer and Patsy Ybarra, Contract Specialist.  The e-mail addresses are Joel.L.Perlroth@noaa.gov and Patsy.A.Ybarra@noaa.gov.  

If desired, responses may be faxed to Mr. Perlroth on 301-258-4525 and Ms. Ybarra on 816 426-7530.  Based on industry comments, it is the Governments intent to update the PWS over the next two (2) to three (3) weeks.

<DESC>NA  AIR FORCE RESEARCH LABORATORY  Sensors Directorate ELECTROMAGNETICS TECHNOLOGY DIVISION (AFRL/SNH) RESEARCH INTERESTS A.  INTRODUCTION 	This is the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Electromagnetics Technology Division of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/SNH) under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.  Awards for proposals submitted in response to this BAA are considered to be the results of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provision of PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.  For purposes of this announcement, basic research is defined to be scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge and understanding related to long term national security needs rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution.  It provides part of the base for subsequent exploratory and advanced developments in defense related technologies.  Only basic research proposals are solicited under this announcement. 	AFRL/SNH contracts with educational institutions, non-profit organizations, and private industry for electromagnetics research.  This BAA is intended to cover, in general nature, all research areas of interest to the Division.  Persons contemplating submission of a proposal to the Electromagnetics Technology Division are encouraged to not only carefully peruse this BAA, but to contact the appropriate scientist identified in this publication as well, to ascertain the extent of interest which AFRL/SNH may have in a specific research project. 	The program is organized by scientific discipline, and the reader will note some overlap between sections.  The research areas described may have short or long-range impact on Air Force capabilities.  Typical research programs sponsored by AFRL/SNH vary in length from 12 to 30 months and require from 1 to 6 total man-years to complete.  If progress in certain areas requires several investigators, and especially if an interdisciplinary approach is necessary, AFRL will consider proposals for more comprehensive basic research programs.  Only a small number of such large programs can be initiated in a single fiscal year.  Inquiries related to comprehensive and interdisciplinary programs should be sent to the AFRL/SNH Division Chief. 	Proposals may be submitted at any time.  We strongly encourage informal discussion and submission of a brief outline of the proposed research (white paper) prior to the submission of a formal proposal.  Key AFRL staff members for each area of interest are identified in the description of that area.  To contact AFRL/SNH staff members by mail, write to the following address, using the appropriate branch symbol: 				Air Force Research Laboratory /(BRANCH SYMBOL) 				80 Scott Drive 				Hanscom AFB MA 01731-2909 B.  MISSION 	 The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) leads the discovery, development, and timely transition of affordable, integrated technologies that keep our Air Force the best in the world.  AFRL is organized into ten technology directorates.  The Electromagnetics Technology Division (AFRL/SNH) at Hanscom AFB MA is part of AFRL's Sensors Directorate, whose mission is to ensure unequaled reconnaissance, surveillance, precision engagement, and electronic warfare capabilities for America's air and space forces by conceiving, demonstrating, and transitioning advanced sensors and sensor technologies in partnership with industry, universities and other DoD agencies, as well as providing knowledgeable support to both the acquisition community and warfighters.  The Electromagnetics Technology Division, in turn, conducts basic research, and exploratory and advanced development programs to meet Air Force systems needs for air, space, and C2 applications in electromagnetics, and in related electronic and electro-optics technologies.  AFRL/SNH explores the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from deep ultraviolet to microwaves, to satisfy growing war-fighter needs by providing cost effective performance options.  C.  RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS 	To support the mission of AFRL/SNH, basic research is required in the areas described below. a. ANTENNA TECHNOLOGY The objective of this program is to advance the understanding of array and multiple beam antennas for ground, aircraft, UAV's, and space-based platforms.  The program encompasses several areas of major activity dealing with fundamental electromagnetics, array control, active array architecture, antenna measurements, and array affordability.  Fundamental electromagnetic issues include the radiation and coupling of antenna elements in arrays, the analysis of antennas conformal to vehicle or support structures, the analysis of printed circuit array elements, and the development of new types of radiators for increased bandwidth or multiple frequency radiation.  The program is concerned with many issues of antenna control.  It deals with digital beamforming, optical distribution of phasing and control signals, novel concepts for limited-scan arrays, and adaptive or even intelligent means of aperture control for null steering, local failure detection, compensation, and correction in very large phased arrays including both the use of expert systems and neural networks.  Multifunction, multifrequency, reconfigurable arrays for aircraft that can be made a structural part of the aircraft skin need to be understood.  Major efforts within the program address the architectural aspects of array fabrication with active amplifiers.  At SHF and EHF frequencies the primary concern is to employ active devices to enhance array control by using amplitude control as well as phase control.  This added flexibility may eliminate the use of hard-wired beamformers and, in addition, improve the null steering capabilities of adaptive arrays.  The program seeks advances in antenna front-end technology to achieve low cost, low loss, lightweight, compact antenna control across the spectrum from microwave to terahertz frequencies. Of particular interest is the development of microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices, with the goal of reducing the size and power requirements for large phased arrays.  The effort exploits new materials, device, and component concepts for lower loss in passive circuits, higher efficiency in active circuits, higher levels of integration, and expanded performance capabilities.  Key antenna architectural issues include the minimization of required via holes, thermal design, bandwidth enhancement, and multi-layer board integration of control and microwave distribution circuits.  Antenna measurement topics of interest include the measurement of very large apertures which are either so large that one cannot make far field measurements, so non-rigid as not to be self-supporting in the earth's gravity field, or so large that funding limitations prohibit assembling the complete antenna structure.  In each of these cases, there is a need to predict and validate the antenna performance to -60dB levels.   Point of Contact:  LIVIO D. POLES, AFRL/SNHA, Tel 781-377-4087, email: livio.poles@hanscom.af.mil . b.  ELECTROMAGNETIC SCATTERING FROM TARGETS AND TERRAIN 	This research is concerned with the scattering of electromagnetic energy from 1) bodies of arbitrary size, shape, and composition, and 2) a wide variety of terrain types representative of real earth.  Frequencies of interest range from 3 MHz to 300 GHz.  Areas of interest include the calculation of scattering cross-sections from arbitrary multi-wavelength bodies, conducting, coated, or penetrable, including high-resolution-radar, bistatic radar phenomena, including depolarization and the statistical description of bistatic data.  Research is conducted towards the development of algorithms that will allow the integration of phenomenological data from multiple sources for improved detection and identification of difficult targets.  The effect of target and clutter depolarization on the signal-to-clutter ratio is also of interest.  The target program consists of both theory and measurements. The terrain program includes research, which provides the understanding for predictive models of scattering from a variety of terrain, especially when covered with foliage and vegetation; collection of data that have been calibrated absolutely, and analysis of the effects of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and terrain on the performance of radar systems.  The effects of clutter reduction using polarization diversity are also being studied.  The effect of clutter cell size on the statistics of the scattered waves in high-resolution, and bistatic radar systems is under investigation.  A comprehensive understanding of statistical behavior of scattering phenomenology is required for the development and validation of models to enhance the performance of adaptive signal processing algorithms with respect to reducing the number of adaptive degrees of freedom, sample support, and computational cost required to suppress clutter.  Issues of importance are robust performance in fiercely non-stationary environments with emphasis on CFAR.  This research, both target and clutter, will be used in the design, development, and evaluation of future space-based and airborne radar systems, and for improved detection and target identification in existing radar systems operating against ground-based targets and low-observable airborne targets in a dense clutter environment.   Point of Contact:  BERTUS WEIJERS, AFRL/SNHE, Tel 781-377-1733, email: bertus.weijers@hanscom.af.mil  c.  OPTRONICS COMPONENTS and ALGORITMS 	This effort is concerned with basic research and development of advanced performance optronic components, subsystems, and algorithms for Air Force "space and air" image restoration/recognition, multispectral detection and non-cooperative ID, target tracking, threat warning and countermeasures, missile guidance, and high bandwidth communications/data-network systems. The emphasis will be on integrable components and technologies in the III-V and group IV materials systems.  This includes indium phosphide (InP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), and their alloys.  This does not exclude other technologies or materials systems such as fiber-based devices, organic semiconductors, and non-linear optical (NLO) materials, waveguides, and devices.  In addition, new heterogeneous devices and integration techniques offering functional performance beyond the capability of similar homogeneous devices in any material system will be considered.  Of particular interest is component research using, for example, fusion and lift-off or other techniques that provide process compatibility for the integration of high performance state-of-the-art components for space applications without performance degradation.  Other categories include pattern recognition algorithms and architectures, spatial light modulators, and the development of new nonlinear optical materials and the optimization of existing materials.  In the category of new nonlinear optical materials, the goal is to provide a material, which simultaneously has sub-millisecond response times, high optical efficiency, and low laser power density requirements.  Emphasis is on materials that can be made to work well at visible and IR laser wavelengths.  Research in this category can include, for example, photorefractive materials such as BaTiO3 or bandgap engineered materials such as multiple quantum wells.  Also of interest are materials that can transfer wavefront information between visible and non-visible electromagnetic waves, for example, visible and infrared.  In the optical signal processing category, we want functions that work in real time.  This can include research into new techniques for performing operations such as correlation, convolution noise removal, edge enhancement, image multiplexing, and optical storage.

IMAGE EXPLOITATION OF INFRARED CAMERAS  Our activities in this area have ranged from the basic study of metal silicides as infrared photo detectors, to fabrication of complete IR sensor systems, to field testing of cameras, to the development of algorithms for special purpose applications.  Recent emphasis is to exploit and extend the applications addressed by modern staring infrared cameras through image/signal processing algorithm development and prototype hardware implementations.  The major research areas are: development of image/signal processing algorithms for IR image enhancement; algorithms for the detection/tracking of unresolved targets in clutter in consecutive frame IR imagery; and algorithms for hyperspectral data acquisition, data reconstruction, and analysis.  In-house-developed thermal infrared sensors and hyperspectral imagers support the research and hinge the algorithm work very closely to real-world data.  Image and signal processing algorithms for image exploitation applications with large format infrared arrays must meet the challenge of real-time operation.  Key applications involve the extraction of information from IR imagery such as through spectral discrimination, point target detection/tracking, range determination, etc. Improved understanding and control of the effects of noise and ground and cloud clutter and studies on how staring arrays behave in various environments such as on moving platforms are important auxiliary topics to address in conjunction with the algorithm development.

<DESC>CLS FOR C-20 AIRCRAFT FLEET
Potential Source Sought


Description:
This is a Small Business Set-Aside Acquisition. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUEST FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. The U.S. Air Force through the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center (OC-ALC) is conducting research to determine the existence of potential business sources interested in providing support for the U.S. Government C-20 fleet of 20 Gulfstream III, IV, and IVSP aircraft as described in the following paragraphs beginning 01 Nov 2003.  These aircraft belong to the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force, and are designated C-20B/C/D/E/G/H.  These aircraft are FAA certified and maintained commercial aircraft modified to meet DoD requirements in various specific configurations, and are powered by Rolls Royce Spey and Tay engines.  They are configured to accommodate 12 to 14 passengers and a crew of five.  The C-20 aircraft are located at four Main Operating Base (MOBs): Ramstein AB GE (C-20H),  Hickam AFB HI (C-20E), Marine Corp Base Hawaii at Kaneohe Bay HI (C-20G), and Andrews AFB MD (C-20B/D/E/G).  The aircraft at Ramstein, Hickam, Kaneohe Bay and Army C-20s at Andrews AFB are supported by full CLS (supply and organizational maintenance).  Partial CLS (supply support only) is provided for Navy and Air Force C-20s at Andrews AFB.  The Navy provides their own organizational maintenance at Andrews AFB and the Air Force replaces their organizational maintenance at Andrews AFB with a base contractor that is not associated with this contract.  Spare parts and support equipment maintained in the Contractor Operated and Maintenance Base Supply (COMBS) located at each MOB are government-owned.  The COMBS at Andrews AFB provides supply support to all the C-20s based at Andrews.  In addition to the MOB supply and maintenance support, the new contract will include a requirement for depot maintenance (scheduled and unscheduled) and depot field team support worldwide for the C-20 airframe, engine, accessories, and avionics.  The depot support shall include all inspections and maintenance required by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the government (DoD and FAA).  The depot maintenance requirement will also include complete airframe paint removal, corrosion control and repaint, as required by the applicable service, as well as security for all C-20 aircraft in depot.  The government requires the contractor to provide a detailed critical path delivery schedule for all aircraft inducted for scheduled depot maintenance.  Delivery schedules will also be required for long-term unscheduled depot maintenance.  These schedules will be required within minimum times after aircraft induction.  Source interested in this requirement should express this in writing to: OC-ALC/PSKBB; ATTN: Rhonda Provence; 3001 Staff Drive Ste 1AC4 106A, Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3020; fax (405) 739-2378.  Email address: Rhonda.Provence@tinker.af.mil.  No telephone requests.  Only written, faxed, or via e-mail requests received directly from the requestor are acceptable.

<DESC>NOTE:  THIS IS A REVISION TO SYNOPSIS POSTED MARCH 4, 2003 FOR THE SAME PROCUREMENT.  THE ONLY CHANGE IS DELETING ANY REFERENCE TO WORK SITES IN MONTGOMERY AND MOBILE ALABAMA

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division is seeking interest from 8(a) firms with bona-fide places of business in the North Florida District of the Small Business Administration. The Navy is targeting the issuance of additional Blanket Ordering Agreement's, (BOA's). The estimated period of performance will be three (3) years with the Government reserving the right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703 (c). BOA's are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) District Offices. The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Southern Division (NAVY) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered. The BOA Holders will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order. On a semi-annual basis, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of: (a) usefulness and need for service, and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only (DesignBuild), to the BOA holders for submission of a proposal. If the parties come to an agreement, a contractual document (task order) will be issued and the BOA holder will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the task order, as directed by the Contracting Officer. Competition for the BOA task orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders in the SBA District noted in this synopsis. However, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition if unable to obtain adequate competition. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement, but there is a threshold minimum of not less than $100,000.00 that can be placed on a task order with a maximum of $3,000,000. A project could be awarded at an amount less than $100,000.00, if all parties are in agreement. The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a Best Value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Scheduling and Price. The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order. There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work. Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the BOA holder or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the BOA Holders only. DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The anticipated work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks. Covered work includes, but is not limited to, the following types: EMERGENCY REPAIRS: Broken and leaking water lines, gas lines, sewers, storm drains, electric power lines, phone lines, associated structures, interior building repairs, broken doors and windows, etc., exterior repairs, roof leaks, related repairs caused by wind damage, flooding, etc., mechanical problems, HVAC and others. MINOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS: Miscellaneous exterior and interior renovations, fence, shelters, ramps, sidewalks, concrete work, installation or replacement of utilities, pipelines, and conduits, installation of miscellaneous electrical and mechanical devices, roof repairs, demolition projects, asphalt, painting, exterior and interior, ceiling repairs or modifications. DESIGNBUILD: On - site design solutions for emergency calls and DesignBuild Services for minor construction items. The SIC/NAICS Codes covered under the BOA for work performed in the NAICS Groups 233, 234, and 235 for construction. GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF COVERAGE: The BOA covers military installations within the Resident Officer in Charge of Construction (ROICC) Pensacola area of responsibility, including NAS Pensacola, NAS Whiting Field, Corry Station, and Outlying Landing Fields (OLF). The agreements will be written for a period of three (3) years. The agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued thereunder. If a firm is graduating from the 8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the agreement holder and the agreement will terminate. Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued. Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation. The agreement holders may be required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal. SOLICITATIONS: Each solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror. The Government reserves the right to obtain a more detailed cost breakdown of labor, materials, equipment, overhead and profit at any time. ORDERS: Individual projects will be awarded using the DD Form 1155 and will provide appropriate descriptions, specifications, administrative requirements, pricing terms and completion time. Each order will be considered a separate binding contract. LIMITATION OF ORDERS: The average range will be from $100,000.00 to a maximum of $3,000,000. . A project could be awarded at an amount less than $100,000.00, if all parties are in agreement. Individual task orders will not exceed a maximum of $3,000,000. SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: (1) Provide 8(a) Certification and applicable district or an 8(a) participant with a bona-fide place of business in either location; (2) Provide documentation to support registration in the Department of Defense Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database; contractors may visit the CCR website at http://www.ccr2000.com/ for information on registering and checking the CCR; (3) Provide a statement that the firm is licensed/bonded and fully capable to perform construction work under the NAICS Code Series 233, 234, and 235 to be identified with each potential task order requirement.

<DESC>This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled “Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes.”  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna(LISA) is a joint NASA/ESA Mission to measure gravitational radiation with a space-borne sensor.  The LISA Project Office at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is soliciting information from industry to support planning for a Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I) contract.  A phased procurement is planned with the initial award in Feb of 2004. The objective of the LISA mission is to observe gravitational waves from galactic and extra-galactic binary systems, including gravitational waves generated in the vicinity of the very massive black holes found in the centers of many galaxies.  Gravitational waves are one of the fundamental building blocks in our theoretical picture of the universe.  Although there is strong indirect evidence for the existence of the gravitational waves, they have not yet been directly detected. The LISA flight segment consists of a constellation of three spacecraft in the shape of an equilateral triangle, 5X106 km on a side.  The center of the triangle formation will be in the ecliptic plane one astronomical unit (AU) from the Sun and 20 degrees behind the Earth. The constellation of three spacecraft measure the distortion (strain) of space-time caused by passing gravitational waves.  Each spacecraft will contain two free-floating “proof masses.”  These proof masses define optical paths 5 million km long, with a 60-degree angle between them.  Lasers in each spacecraft will be used to measure changes in the optical path lengths with a precision of 20 picometers. Subject to formal approval, the project starts development (Phase C/D) in the year 2007 with a launch in 2011.  The LISA web site ( http://lisa.nasa.gov ) describes the science objectives of the mission; the proposed mission itself, the spacecraft and instruments; some of the technology challenges that must be met; and a background primer on gravitational waves.  Select a section heading at the left to find out more about the LISA mission. The LISA mission is planned as a bilateral and mutual partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA).  While contributors are still under negotiation, the following should be assumed: ESA:   ·Mission Management and System Engineering Partner ·Management of all European contributions ·Delivery of three spacecraft European Member States: ·Science team co-chair and membership  ·Instrument/systems technology and instrument components NASA/Goddard: ·Mission Management and System Engineering Partner ·US management and systems engineering lead ·Systems integration ·Instrument/systems technology NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory:   ·Science management ·Payload management and Systems engineering ·Instrument/systems technology and instrument components Mission design, mission operations planning and execution As a result of this Request for Information (RFI), NASA anticipates entering into a Partnering Phase activity with potential offerors who are determined to be viable competitors for the SE&I contract (see below).  The acquisition schedule is as follows: ·March 2003 - January 2004 Partnering Phase: Viable competitors will be given the opportunity to meet with the Government, both in groups and in one-on-one sessions.  During this Phase there will be exchanges of information that will enable potential offerors to prepare for the subsequent acquisition, and to make recommendations to the Government concerning its requirements and its acquisition approach. ·February 2004 - March 2005 Preparation Phase: Two Contractors will provide parallel analyses and support services in support of the Formulation Phase of the LISA Mission and will finalize a plan to continue such support through completion of the LISA Mission. This phase will result from a Request for Proposals (RFP) to be issued in October 2003, with contract award in February 2004.	The Government anticipates awarding two parallel Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contracts, each worth ~$TBD M. ·April 2005 - Project Completion –Execution Phase: A single Contractor will provide all of the remaining SE&I support services required for LISA.  The Contractor will be chosen using Phased-Acquisition down-select procedures.  The instructions to offerors for the down-selection will be issued in September 2004.  The Government anticipates a Cost-Reimbursable contract with Award and Incentive features.  The scope of work of the SE&I contract is expected to be as described in the following paragraph.  However, this scope is very preliminary at this time.  The Government anticipates that during the Partnering Phase, it will solicit input and recommendations that will be considered in determining the scope of work for the subsequent Request for Proposal. Scope of Work for SE&I Contractor  The LISA project will use Integrated Technical Teams throughout formulation and implementation to facilitate and coordinate activities across the various partners. NASA will use the SE&I contractor to augment and coordinate activities between these ITT’s.	These tasks may include: ·Requirements flowdown, ·System verification and validation ·Interface definition and management ·Operations concept definition ·Design definition,  ·Software system engineering ·Risk management.	In addition, contractor may be responsible for: ·Planning, coordinating, and executing the payload and   observatory integration and test ·Definition and implementation of LISA’s knowledge management     systems ·Designing and building Ground Support Equipment and test   fixtures.  ·Development and test of the mission software. Presolicitation: This RFI is a solicitation for information and planning purposes.  NASA has posted certain information at ( http://lisa.gsfc.nasa.gov/Business/Business.html ) to enable potential offerors to learn more about the LISA Program, and to enable them to respond to this RFI.  The information contained on this web site is essential for developing an understanding of the LISA program.	Of particular importance is the Technology Readiness and Implementation Plan (TRIP), which contains some discussion of the role of the LISA SE&I contractor. The objective of this RFI is: to invite potential offerors to submit information that allows the Government to advise the offerors about their potential to be viable competitors; to promote competition; to improve potential offerors’ understanding of the Government’s requirements; and to improve the Government’s knowledge of industry’s capabilities.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit comments for any possible improvements to the Government’s acquisition approach. This notice constitutes all information concerning the LISA SE&I procurement that will be furnished at this time.

<SUBJECT>U.S. Department of Energy Fourth Annual Small Business Conference
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) will sponsor its Fourth Annual Small Business Conference on May 12-15, 2002, in Albuquerque, New Mexico at the Albuquerque Convention Center. This year's conference theme Securing Economic Freedom-Empowering Small Business reflects DOE'S response to the President's Agenda on Small Business as well as DOE'S commitment to small businesses. The conference plays a major role in providing procurement guidance and contracting opportunities to small business. The conference will bring together representatives of the Department, its prime contractors, our network of National Laboratories, and several other Federal agencies to provide valuable information about business lines and upcoming contracting opportunities at DOE and at other agencies as well. The Department continues to be committed to fully engaging small businesses, including small disadvantaged, 8(a), women-owned businesses, and HUBZone small business concerns, in DOE's core missions.  DOE has exciting opportunities to offer small businesses in the areas of commodities, administrative services, science, security, and environmental quality and energy resources.  It is important that business leaders, advocates, and DOE program representatives celebrate the achievements of DOE small business partners, as well as build new and stronger alliances between the small business community and DOE laboratories. DOE has received positive reviews on the previous three conferences, as well as recommendations from the small business community. This year's conference will continue to provide the essential information and guidance needed to do business with the Department and will also incorporate some of the significant recommendations received from prior years.  It is through outreach activities such as this that the Department finds small businesses with the capabilities to match its contracting opportunities.   For more information or to register, please visit the conference website at http://www.smallbusiness-outreach.doe.gov/ .  DOE looks forward to your participation.

<SUBJECT>D -- Questions & Answers for RFP 03-304
<DESC>Questions & Answers for RFP 03-304


1.	In Section 2.1, Project Management Plan, Page 7, you mention that no later than 120 days after CA, the Contractor shall complete transition to the offsite infrastructure Operations environment proposed as the integrated solution.  Does “infrastructure operations” mean only the operations?  Or are you looking at moving the servers (File, Email, Web) and applications to the offsite as well?

Answer:	Within 120 days after contract award the contractor is to replace the onsite data center with an offsite facility.

2.	It is stated that there is no incumbent. Can you tell me who the Finance Board is begin supported today for all of their IT requirements?

Answer:	As described in the Work Statement, paragraphs 1.2 and 1.6, the Finance Board infrastructure operations support is currently provided by a mix of Government staff and multiple contractors.

3.	What about the transition of the Operations Support Systems (i.e., Help Desk/Trouble Ticketing, Fault Management, Performance Management, etc.)?  Does the Contractor have to provide a transition of the systems currently at the FHFB facility to the Contractor Facility?  If yes, Are you expecting the Contractor to utilize the same systems that are currently in place in FHFB (i.e., Remedy) or can the Contractor utilize its existing Trouble Ticketing system which may be different than that of the FHFB?

Answer:	The proposed integrated solution must be implemented so as to provide all functions necessary to properly perform infrastructure operations support. These functions include Help Desk/Trouble Tickets and Performance Management. How the functions are provided, including specific automated tools to be used, is to be proposed by the contractor and needs to be explicitly identified and discussed in the proposal.

4.	Section V, Contract Award, Subsection B (1) Submission of Proposals, Page 65, you state that the technical proposal shall not exceed 25 pages.  Is this 25 pages single-sided or 25 pages double-sided?

Answer:	Single sided.

5.	Section V, Contract Award, Subsection B (1) (b) Submission of Proposals, Page 65, you state that the technical, management, and past performance proposal is to be divided under separate cover.  Does this mean each of these 3 and Cost are to be in different binders?  Or can they all be under one Binder divided into 4 Sections?

Answer:	Cost must be submitted in a separate binder. Technical, management, and past performance can be submitted in one binder or three binders.

6.	Section 3.2, Hardware, Page 10, it is stated that the Contractor shall replace all existing FHFB end user equipment within one year after CA.  And that the Contractor shall assume ownership of the equipment after replacement.  Are you referring to the old/replaced equipment or the new equipment that the Contractor shall assume ownership of?

Answer:	The Finance Board retains ownership of old/replaced equipment. The contractor retains ownership of new equipment.

7.	In the software list, there is no reference to network management software (like HP OpenView or Tivoli).  Does FHFB have such a product?

Answer:	The Finance Board expects the contractor to propose, implement and operate a modern effective network management function with all necessary hardware and software products as part of the overall integrated solution. The Finance Board currently uses WhatsUp Gold for network monitoring.

8.	What are the backend systems using for a database – Oracle, SQL 2000, Sybase, etc.?

Answer:	Currently the Finance Board uses a web frontend (IIS,ASP and ASP.NET)and a SQL backend for the vast majority of it's applications.(see RFP Attachment A).

9.	Do you plan to move completely to Windows 2000, or are we to propose that ourselves?  Do you plan to implement (or to have implemented) Active Directory? Do you plan a migration from Exchange 5.5 to Exchange 2000?  If so, would that (and taskings like that) be part of the T&M requirement?

Answer:	The Finance Board expects the contractor to propose, implement and operate a modern effective network management function with all necessary hardware and software products as part of the overall integrated solution. The proposed solution must identify and implement methods to assure that the Finance Board infrastructure operations environment keeps pace with industry best practices and technological advances, including refresh schedules for infrastructure software, such as operating or email systems. Migrating to an enhanced version of a proposed baseline package would not be considered a T&M task but rather a task required to keep the operations environment current and most efficient and productive.

10.		Should we include any support for BlackBerry or other PDA devices?

Answer:	The number and types of PDA devices in use at the Finance Board require very minimal support. Currently, there are no BlackBerry devices in use at the Finance Board (see RFP Attachment B).

11.	Is all DC staff in the same building?

Answer:	Yes.

12.	Does the Finance Board want to locate most or all of the IT infrastructure at a contractor site?

Answer:	Yes.

13.	Section 3.9 refers to “30-40 laptops”, but the Hardware Inventory lists 88.  Is there another category of use for the 40-50 laptops omitted in Section 3.9?
Answer:	Of the 40-50 laptops omitted in Section 3.9, approximately 15 are in inventory for future use and the remaining 30-35 are to be excessed.

14.	When does the Finance Board intend to make award?

Answer:	The Finance Board intends to make award early June, 2003.

15.	When does the Finance Board anticipate work will start under the contract?

Answer:	Per the statement of work, work will begin 3 days after contract award.

<SUBJECT>D -- Contractor Performance Evaluation Maintenance/Support/Enhancements
<DESC>The Centers For Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award a delivery order, under GSA schedule on a sole source basis to ICF Information Technology, Inc, 9300 Lee Highway, Fairfax, VA 22031-1207 for maintenance, support and enhancements of the Contractor Performance Evaluation (CPE).  They will support CPE Database Application and Report Maintenance.  Develop enhancements to user interface and management reports functions.  CMS has contracted with private insurers to perform various administrative functions under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act.  CMS contracts with fiscal intermediaries and carriers to pay claims promptly and accurately, to safeguard the Medicare Trust Fund, and to foster good beneficiary and provider relations.  Medicare fiscal intermediaries and carriers, collectively known as Medicare contractors, must administer the Medicare program efficiently and economically.  CMS has developed a Contractor Performance Evaluation (CPE) process that sets performance excpectations for Medicare contractors; measures the performance of the contractor; evaluates performance against expectations; and takes appropriate contract action based upon evaluation of the contractor’s performance.  CMS has designed the CPE process to review of all activities required of fiscal intermediaries and carriers to ensure they adequately perform the duties which law, regulation, and CMS directives require of them.  National teams consisting of CMS’s central office and regional office staffs conduct the CPE reviews of Medicare fiscal intermediaries and carriers.  The CMS reviewers are responsible for scheduling, managing, and tracking individual CPE reviews and providing appropriate notifications to the Medicare contractors.

 In fiscal year 1999 a contract was awarded to ICF for development of a national database application to streamline the CPE workflow.  The CPE National Database is currently resident on the CMS network in a production environment.  All authorized CMS personnel access and run the application with Microsoft Internet Explorer via the CMS network, with remote users dialing into the network.  The front-end of the application (user interfaces) is distributed via an Intranet web site to all authorized users.  The centralized database application also provides comprehensive management reports data for planning and analysis purposes. ICF designed, developed, tested and implemented the CPE database application.  This will allow ICF to continue with tasks from the original work statement to safeguard the database against system degradation and maximize the government's ability to respond to mandated critical time frames.

<SUBJECT>R -- Red Flag Debriefing and Automation Support Service
<DESC>This is a notice that the 99th Contracting Squadron intends to negotiate a Sole Source extension of contract F26600-98-C-X001 with Arcata Associates, Inc, Las Vegas NV for a period of one to five months to provide debriefing and automation data support service for the 414th CTS (Red Flag) at Nellis AFB NV under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a).  Sole-Source negotiation with Arcata Associates, Inc. is in the best interest of the government.  Until a new contract can be put in place, follow-on services are deemed to be available only from the original source in the follow-on contract for the continuation of highly specialized services.  It is expected that award to any other source would result in-substantial duplication of costs not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.  To use any source other than Arcata Associates, Inc. would involve the significant, additional cost and time required to obtain appropriate security clearances, and gain the appropriate working knowledge to successfully perform the effort.  This notice is not a request for proposal nor a solicitation for offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

SECTION B.1 – GENERAL.  Your proposal shall consist of an original and three (3) copies of the technical proposal; and an original and one (1) copy of the pricing proposal.  No cost information shall be included in the technical proposal. The pricing proposal shall be completely separate from the technical proposal.  The proposal will become the property of the Government and will not be returned.  If the proposal contains information you do not wish disclosed to the public or used by the Government for any purpose other than evaluation of the proposal, such restriction shall be clearly indicated on each sheet containing such information.  The Government reserves the right to make the award without discussion of the proposals received under this solicitation.  Accordingly, you should submit your proposal on the most favorable terms possible from both a technical and pricing standpoint. SECTION B.2 - LABOR CATEGORIES.  The Government believes the generic asbestos worker, industrial hygienist, and insulator labor categories represent the most significant categories of skills required. The Government intends to use these generic descriptions as benchmarks for evaluating the personal qualifications of your proposed personnel. You should bear this in mind when preparing resumes.  We would need to indicate the estimated number of hours over the term of this BPA for purposes of determining the total estimated evaluated total cost for the price evaluation.  B.2.1  Labor Category Definitions:  (1) ASBESTOS WORKER.  The person shall have knowledge and awareness of the proper safety and physical requirement to remove and properly dispose of asbestos containing material.  The person shall be in compliance with medical surveillance and licensing. (2) CERTIFIED INDUSTRIAL HYGIENIST.

The person must report all findings from laboratory results before any area has proper clearance.  The person must be certified within the governing area of the project. (3) INSULATOR.  The person shall possess the knowledge and ability to insulate according to individual system requirements. The Contractor shall meet minimum industry standards for each of these positions. SECTION B.3 - OFFEROR’S QUESTIONS.  OPM will provide, upon request, a site visit.  Arrangements can be made by contacting G. Steve Ruther, the contracting officer, at 202-606-1616.  SECTION B.4 – TECHNICAL PROPOSAL.  B.4.1 General.  In the Technical Proposal, you must set forth in detail the technical/management plans by which you intend to provide the services described in Section A.  This description will be an important factor in the Government’s selection process since the information provides a basis for the evaluation by the Government of your ability to provide the services described in this solicitation.  A complete, well-prepared technical proposal will have the following characteristics: (1) It will give precedence to substance in the form of verifiable facts and not be unnecessarily elaborate. Graphics will be minimized and used only where necessary to achieve complete understanding. (2) It will clearly reflect that you kept the Evaluation Factors for Award in Section C in mind as you prepared the proposal - including what the factors are and their relative weights. (3) It will be divided into clearly marked sections.  Each section will be clearly labeled following the outline below and will contain all of the information requested.  B.4.2  Past Performance and Technical Experience of the Offeror.  In this section, please submit the information requested in Sections A through C below for both the offeror and any proposed major subcontractors. The Government will use this information for two, separate, but related, purposes. They are: (1) To assess how well the Contractor has performed in the past (past performance), and (2) To determine how relevant the work performed is to the requirement in this solicitation (technical experience). These two, distinct purposes give rise to the need for varying amounts of information. Therefore, please clearly label each contract you list with one of the following three descriptions:  (1) For past performance assessment only; (2) For both past performance and technical experience assessment; or (3) For technical experience assessment only. B.4.2.1  Section 1 - Past Performance. To permit evaluation of your past performance, please submit: A list of the most recent six (6) contracts and subcontracts for similar services completed during the last three (3) calendar years.  Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of the state and local governments, and commercial customers.  Offerors that are newly formed entities without prior contracts should list contracts and subcontracts as required above for all key personnel.  For each contract/subcontract, include the following: (1) Client agency or company name, including the specific organizational entity for which services were performed; (2) Client agency or company address; (3) Type and scope of service provided; e.g., (highlight any information that would be helpful in judging the nature and complexity of the work performed); (4) Contract number; (5) Contract type and dollar amount;(6) Name, title, and verified telephone number of the client agency Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (or equivalent references for non-Government work); (7) Administrative Contracting Officer (if different from Item (6) above) and verified telephone number; (8) Contract start date, scheduled completion date, and actual completion date (if different than scheduled completion date, provide explanation); (9) Original contract cost/price and final contract cost/price; and (10) A description of any quality awards or certifications that indicate the offeror possesses a high-quality process for producing the service required. Such awards or certifications include, for example, the Malcolm Baldridge Quality Award, other government quality awards, and private sector awards or certifications. Identify what segment of the company (one division or the entire company) received the award or certification. Describe when the award or certification was bestowed. If the award or certification is over three (3) years old, present evidence that the qualifications still apply. 
Each offeror will be evaluated on his/her performance under existing and prior contracts for similar products or services. Performance information will be used as an evaluation factor against which offerors’ relative rankings will be compared to assure best value to the Government. The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government with the information received used in the evaluation of the offeror’s past performance.  B.4.2.2  Section 2 - Technical Experience.  You may have other relevant technical experience you wish considered that occurred within the last five (5) years that has not been included under the three (3) year limit under Section B.4.2.1. above.  If so, provide the information in Items “(1)” to “(9)” under B.4.2.1 for each such engagement. SECTION B.5 - PRICING PROPOSAL.  The pricing proposal shall be completely separate from the technical proposal and shall contain: (1) The names and telephone numbers of the persons authorized to conduct oral discussions/negotiations for the offeror, and Attachment 2, Restriction against Disclosure Statement. (2) Offerors should include hourly rates for each of the labor categories listed in Section B.2.1.  (3) The Cost Proposal shall be submitted under separate cover.  SECTION B.6 - PERIOD FOR ACCEPTANCE OF OFFER.  Proposals offering less than 60 calendar days for acceptance by the Government calculated from the date designated for receipt of offers will be considered non-responsive and will be rejected. SECTION B.7 - FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT.  Offerors are reminded that information furnished under this solicitation, including unit prices, may be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Therefore, all items that are confidential to business, or contain trade secrets, proprietary, or personnel information must be clearly marked. Marking of items will not necessarily preclude disclosure when the Office of Personnel Management determines disclosure is warranted by the Freedom of Information Act. SECTION B.8 - NOTICE TO OFFERORS.  This solicitation and resulting BPA shall not cover charges for any items that are not specifically provided for in the BPA. These and other items not specifically covered by the BPA must be paid for by the person obtaining them if the Contractor wishes to offer them. Contractors are cautioned that if they provide non-covered services/supplies during contract performance, regardless of who requests them (including the Contracting Officer’s Representative), payment will not be made for them under this BPA.  PART C: EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD.  C.1  PRICE/COST EVALUATION.  The Government will review the prices proposed to determine if they are fair and reasonable. C.2  DISCOUNT LIMITATION.  The Offeror may quote any trade and/or special discounts that they desire to the offer to the Government. All trade and/or special discounts will be considered in the evaluation of offers. C.3  TECHNICAL EVALUATION.  The written technical proposals will be evaluated to determine your company's ability to successfully perform the services specified in this solicitation document.  In making this decision, we will consider the following factors: (1) Understanding the scope of the work; (2) Experience and Past Performance; (3) Professional staff qualifications; and (4) Welfare to work plan (This needs to be described in Section B).  C.4  PRICE PROPOSAL EVALUATION.  The Government will use price analysis to evaluate your proposed hourly rates to determine whether or not they are fair and reasonable.  C.5  AWARD. The Government will establish a single BPA with the offeror that it determines offers the best value to OPM.  In determining best value OPM will consider primarily technical excellence and secondarily, the proposed hourly rates for performing the services described in this solicitation.  NOTE: Technical excellence will be significantly more important than price in determining the offeror with whom the BPA will be established.  The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors—Commercial applies to this acquisition.  Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items with its proposal.  The clauses 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification—Commercial Items; 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items; 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders—Commercial Items.
