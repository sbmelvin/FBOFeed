The Banking and Financial Services Program is charged with promoting commercial banking sector development that efficiently intermediates between savers and investors.  To achieve this, the program works with central banks, ministries of finance, banking regulatory and supervision agencies, deposit insurance agencies, banking associations, and other banking related entities in countries with emerging or transition economies.

Ideal candidates would have experience with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve, Resolution Trust Corporation, international financial institutions, and/or commercial banks.  Prior overseas experience working in challenging environments would be a distinct advantage but is not mandatory.  While technical skills are essential, the ability to gain the confidence of officials in host countries is also very important.
 
Candidates must be U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens.

The Citrix Presentation Server Enterprise Edition Licenses have been identified as an integral piece in the Departments Thin Client deployment package. Use of third party software that has not been tested by the Department nor has been proven in concert with Department-specific server configurations may result in OS\Application conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and ultimately render the Thin Client solution inoperable. Citrix offers the Department an online licensing system with built in tracking. Also, the Citrix ICA protocol, which is the backbone of how Thin Clients communicate to the Citrix Server protocol, which is the backbone of how Thin Clients communicate to the Citrix Server Farm, requires only a small amount of bandwidth (22K) for minimal operations. Citrixs concurrent licensing scheme allows the department to efficiently support worldwide deployments; its licensing also allows flexibility in deploying a de-centralized or centralized model, depending on the customers needs. Additionally, FSI is now an approved Citrix training facility through which all Foreign Service employees (IT Staff) are trained.To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the software must be a Citrix brand and provided by a Citrix reseller. Citrix provides a stable and scalable clustering service not provided by any other vendor.  In addition, components of this type cannot be placed on the network without being approved by the IT CCB; and it takes several months to get new items approved. Citrix is already IT CCB approved.IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the licenses listed in paragraph two (2) as a key component of the Departments networking system. The licenses listed above are required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of States enterprise network infrastructure. Use of third party software that has not been tested by the Department nor has been proven in concert with Department-specific server configurations may result in OS\Application conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and ultimately render the Thing Client solution inoperable.Per FAR 8.405-6 (e)(1), this acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.<BR><BR>

To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the Line Cards and Modules must be a Cisco model and provided by a Cisco reseller. IRM/OPS/ITI Special Projects has identified the Cisco equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as key components of the Departments networking system. Equipment listed  is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of States enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. This acquisition will be advertised on FedBid, a reverse auction site.<BR><BR>

<DESC>FAA Aviation Weather Office (AWO) Turbulence Reporting System Comparison Market Survey
The US Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Aviation Weather Office (AWO) is part of the FAA's Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and Operations Planning Business Unit. The mission of the AWO is to realize the future of aviation by providing integrated weather strategies and solutions to achieve national and international goals.  AWO does this by developing and coordinating the strategic direction for weather initiatives in the FAA's Aviation Weather Enterprise, including NextGen requirements, to mitigate the impact of weather in the National Airspace System (NAS).
Purpose of the Market Survey
The FAA/AWO is conducting market research via a market survey to determine the utility of different airborne turbulence detection systems.  This is an effort to identify organizations that: 1) have developed systems that will measure turbulence from aircraft in flight (in situ) in Eddy Dissipation Rate (EDR), and 2) that can demonstrate the comparability of such measurements with the EDR data produced by an FAA Aviation Weather Research Program (AWRP)-sponsored algorithm developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  Interested parties should complete all parts of this document as instructed below. We also invite you to submit additional information to supplement the document that may offer greater insight about your organization and its capabilities.  
Please be advised that this is a market survey.  This is not a solicitation, Screening Information Request (SIR) or Request for Proposals (RFP) of any kind and cannot be construed as a commitment by the FAA for either future business or a future contractual relationship with the FAA.  Please note that this market survey does not commit the FAA to a contract nor commit the FAA to issue a RFP or a SIR. 
All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred or associated with any submission received from any interested party in response to this market survey.  Therefore, any costs associated with the submission will be solely at the interested party's expense.  
The purpose of this market survey is to gather information that will assist the FAA in determining the availability of in situ EDR measurement and reporting systems that are comparable to the NCAR-developed EDR algorithm.
Current Environment
The FAA AWRP sponsors research that is targeted towards minimizing aviation meteorology impacts on the NAS.  Specifically, the research focuses on increasing NAS safety and capacity. The NAS is a complex system whose safe and efficient operation is dependent on the accurate nowcast and forecast of aviation weather conditions. Atmospheric turbulence is a critical area of concern for aviators and weather forecasters alike. 
EDR-based turbulence measurements are a NextGen required parameter, and hence the FAA is interested in in situ observation systems that report turbulence data in EDR.  
Background and Scope
The FAA has funded the adaptation, testing, and deployment of the NCAR-developed EDR algorithm on various commercial aircraft as part of the AWRP's Turbulence Research Team (TRT) efforts to validate EDR data as a means to enhance operational efficiency of the NAS . The NCAR-developed EDR algorithm uses the vertical winds measured by existing aircraft sensors to derive an objective measure of atmospheric turbulence. EDR is aircraft-independent and reported at a much greater frequency than Pilot Reports (PIREPS), and data from the EDR algorithm have been shown to improve meteorological forecasts.  Delta Airlines, Inc. (DAL) completed installation of the EDR algorithm on its B737NG fleet in September 2008 and is beginning to use it operationally, and Southwest Airlines (SWA) is expected to begin deployment later this year.
The FAA AWO is seeking to determine availability of in situ turbulence reporting systems that provide EDR data comparable to that produced by the NCAR-developed EDR algorithm installed on commercial aircraft.  This market survey will examine the capability of organizations to provide these EDR turbulence measurements in a cost effective manner. Specifically, any system that the FAA would be interested in must meet the following requirements:
1.	It must be immediately commercially available (i.e., the FAA will not fund further research or development).2.	It must already be operational on the aircraft (i.e., the FAA will not fund the installation of the system on any aircraft).3.	It must provide EDR data that can be directly compared to that produced by the EDR algorithm already installed on commercial aircraft (i.e., it must be directly comparable in terms of time, location, aircraft configuration, and atmospheric conditions).

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Germann Instruments, Inc. for the Air Void Analyzer (AVA) 3000 system,  AVA 2260 Verification Kit and one day training by an AVA specialist.  Germann Instruments will provide concrete testing instrument capabilities by characterizing the air void system of plastic concrete.  The testing determines the air-void characteristics of fresh concrete by expelling the air bubbles present in a given mortar sample, collecting the air bubbles and recording their quantities, and calculating their size distribution.  The assembly, the sampling equipment and materials must be designed and built to function as an integrated system that is demonstrated by the manufacturer to accurately measure and calculate air-void distribution in fresh air-entranced concrete.  Additionally, the system will determine the freeze-thaw durability of concrete.  Because Germann Instruments is the sole manufacturer and sole distributor of the product and system they are considered the only source for the services.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is July 20, 2009.

<DESC>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Mid-Columbia River National Wildlife Refuge Complex has the requirement for supply of bareroot and rooted cutting native riparian plant stock.  Contract may be awarded by line item.  Award will be made based on best value to government and on vendor's ability to meet the material source requirements stated in the Scope below.  Vendors should bid by line item and, if able, for total order.  Include shipping charges in line item bids.
In 2007 and 2008 numerous large wildfires burned more than 109,620 acres of critical shrub-steppe and riparian habitats of several management areas of the Complex, and among other things eliminated the existing tree cover from riparian areas within the fire zones.  This area lies within the Columbia Plateau Ecoregion of eastern Washington and Oregon, and represents the extreme of the shrub-steppe ecosystem (e.g., low elevation, extended periods of high temperatures, extremely low precipitation, frequent significant (drying) wind events, alluvial sandy soils).  Being the extreme of the shrub-steppe ecosystem this area also faces above normal competition pressure from invasive species, leading to significantly reduced natural recovery potential.  It is critical that native plant materials be adapted to conditions present on Complex refuges to maximize the probability of establishment, survival, and reproduction.
PLACE/DELIVERY AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The vendor(s) shall contact the technical coordinator to arrange delivery of, and set a delivery date for, all plant materials to USFWS at 64 Maple St., Burbank, WA  99323.  Delivery must be made during normal duty hours (see Line Item 7.1) unless an alternate delivery time/arrangement is made with the technical coordinator.
Delivery date is anticipated to be approximately January 15, 2011.  Final delivery date must be set with the technical coordinator(s).
Plants must be adequately packaged to allow for transport in pickup(s) and/or on open trailers.

<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: NIST Physics Laboratory requests a ORTEC SLP Silicon (Li) X-ray Detector System to update and replace an older system that is no longer operational. The old system needs to be replaced by a new one that is compatible with the existing data acquisition systems. Currently we have 5 other detection systems for high energy gamma-ray measurements that use the Ametek acquisition system. The new system needs to be controlled by this same acquisition system. The ORTEC SLP Silicon (Li) X-ray Detector System by Ametek is the only commercially available detection system that will ensure compatibility with the existing acquisition systems. Using the commercially available system with its own hardware would save the Government significant time and money eliminating the need to purchase and incorporate new hardware into the existing system. As a result, Ametek is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.</p>

<p>(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.<br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: NIST Physics Laboratory requests a Fiber-terminated Flat Plate to operate in accordance with the original equipment specifications from the manufacturer. The Fiber-terminated Flat Plate by RoMack, Inc. is the only commercially available hardware to ensure compatibility with the existing system. A backplate has already been developed to work specifically with the RoMack, Inc. flat plate. The existing system is comprised of heaters, thermistors, and filter radiometers that are associated with this backplate. Other fiber-terminated plates may be used with our existing system, but significant effort and changes would need to be done in house to accommodate such plates. In addition, a completed thermal analysis test was conducted at NASA Goddard using our existing system. Using a different vendor's product would mean re-designing the current backplate; therefore the results of the thermal analysis test would no longer be valid. Consequently, using the commercially available system with its own hardware would save the Government significant time and money eliminating the need to purchase and incorporate new hardware into the existing system. As a result, RoMack, Inc. is uniquely qualified to satisfy the Government's minimum requirements.</p>

<DESC>NRCS-Illinois plans to issue a solicitation for a logjam removal Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) project.   The logjams are located on the North Fork of the Embarrass River in the in the Illinois counties of Clark, Crawford, and Jasper.

Some of the debris piles must be burned.  The estimated price range is between $100,000 and $250,000.

To allow potential offerors and opportunity to obtain a better understanding of the work required, a pre-bid conference will be held on April 30, 2009, at 10:00 AM local time at the Crawford County NRCS field office located at 1212 N. Allen Street, Robinson, Illinois.  The group will not tour the sites since the project area is quite large.

Interested parties may use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane.
The Government received an unsolicited proposal from Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) for research into safety and early detection of Lithium Ion batteries failures.  The Government anticipates negotiations with IUPUI will occur on a sole-source basis.  The effort is anticipated to take three years to complete, and it is anticipated that efforts for years two and three will be priced options.  IUPUI will utilize Delphi to provide experience on commercial applications of Li-ion batteries, and NSWC Crane will be utilized to provide experience on military applications and additional testing capabilities.  The expected outcome of this effort is to improve pack safety by early failure detection; understand the system, cell, component and material root causes leading to failures under both normal and extreme conditions; identification and development of non-intrusive methods to detect early signs of hazardous failures under both normal and extreme conditions; and development of a practical, cost effective and reliable early failure apparatus and safety monitor useful for commercial and military Li-ion battery applications.All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to Crane web site, FedBizOpps and NECO.  It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor the Crane web site, FedBizOpps and/or NECO for amendments that may be issued to this synopsis.

<DESC>This pre-solicitation synopsis is for Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) Funds Administration Services requirement.  This synopsis is prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2.  The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) intends to select a Contractor to assume the roles and responsibilities of the Interstate TRS Fund Administrator (Administrator).   The Administrator shall be responsible for all functions associated with administering the Interstate TRS Fund (Fund) including (1) collecting monies from covered interstate common carriers and VoIP providers to create the Fund; (2)  developing annual compensation rates, in accordance with Commission guidance, for the various forms of TRS; (3) determining the annual Fund size and carrier contribution factor based on the compensation rates and projected minutes of use for each form of TRS; (4) paying monies from the Fund to eligible TRS providers to compensate them for their reasonable costs of providing TRS; (5) advising the Commission on cost-recovery issues and managing and safeguarding the Fund; and (6)  Implementing effective internal controls in accordance with the standards and guidelines established in OMB Circular A-123.  The Administrator is responsible for administering and managing the Fund in an efficient, effective manner to ensure that people with disabilities enjoy the benefits of the program as Congress intended.  The Contractor shall assume the Administrator functions from the entity currently performing these functions.

Title IV of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which added section 225 to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Act), requires the Commission to ensure that TRS is available to persons with hearing and speech disabilities.  Specifically, section 225 of the Act instructs the Commission to ensure that TRS is available, to the extent possible and in the most efficient manner, to persons with hearing or speech disabilities in the United States.  The statute requires each common carrier offering telephone voice transmission services to offer TRS to persons with hearing and speech disabilities that is functionally equivalent to voice telephone service.

TRS is available nationwide, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, so that persons with hearing and speech disabilities can make calls to, and receive calls from, voice telephone users.  In some circumstances, TRS equipment also permits persons with hearing disabilities to communicate directly with each other (although such calls are not TRS calls).  Initially, only interstate TTY-based TRS (traditional TRS) minutes were reimbursed from the Fund; however, today the Fund reimburses relay service providers for several forms of TRS.  These are:  (1) interstate traditional TRS; (2) interstate Speech-to-Speech (STS); (3) interstate captioned telephone service (CTS); (4) interstate and intrastate IP Relay; (5) interstate and intrastate Video Relay Service (VRS); and (6) interstate and intrastate Internet Protocol (IP) captioned telephone service (IP CTS).

Required services are to cover a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.  The Government anticipates the release of Solicitation No. SOL09000002 within 2 to 3 weeks predicated on a full and open competition basis.  The Government anticipates a vendor response time of 90 days after release of solicitation.  Although it is the Governments intent to release the solicitation electronically via Government Point of Entry (GPE), potential sources interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation must contact Tony Wimbush, Contracts Specialist/Contracting Officer, FCC/Contracts & Purchasing Center, at 202-418-0932 or via email at anthony.wimbush@fcc.gov.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<CONTACT>Thomas Bouchard, (508) 233-4026

<a href="mailto:thomas.bouchard@us.army.mil">RDECOM Acquisition Center - Natick</a>
<DESC>The U. S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, Natick, MA on behalf of the DoD Centers of Excellence (DCoE) for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) has a requirement for leasing and operation of hyperbaric oxygenation chambers. The DCoE is sponsoring a Randomized Clinical Trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen for the treatment of Wounded Warriors who have chronic mild-to-moderate TBI. Study subjects will undergo either a series of 40 hyperbaric oxygen exposures at 1.5 atmospheres absolute (atm abs) or 40 sham exposures of room air at 1.2 atm abs over an 8 to 10 week period.  Since the brain-injured subjects recruited for this clinical trial are assigned to several military installations in the continental United States, and because being away from their support structure is not ideal, mobile/portable hyperbaric chambers and chamber support staff will be placed at selected military bases where these affected Service members reside.  Mobile study sites may include Camp Pendleton, CA, Camp Lejeune, NC, Fort Carson, CO, and Fort Hood, TX. Anticipated period of performance is 12 to 24 months. For multiplace chambers that can accommodate six subjects plus an inside attendant, four separate compressions will be planned each day at each study site. Smaller multiplace chambers may be considered, but more than one chamber per site will be necessary to accommodate the necessary daily use.  If monoplace chambers are used, each site would need to have at least six monoplace chambers.  A combination of monoplace or multiplace chambers is acceptable, either by site, or across the four-site study network, so long as the daily capacity requirements are met.  Each chamber must be housed in a mobile system, such as a trailer or other mobile structure that accommodates both the processes and the patients. Air and oxygen must be supplied at the chambers, and cannot be obtained from the nearby medical facilities. All chambers must satisfy the appropriate codes (ASME  PVHO; and NFPA). Appropriate contractor staff must be provided to operate the chambers, with the demands outlined above.  All chamber staff and inside attendants must be Certified Hyperbaric Technologists (CHTs) with current competency and CHT certification. Certified hyperbaric registered nurses (CHRN) would also be acceptable staff. The Government may consider the effort for the equipment and for the personnel to be two separate contracts. This effort is a program under the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs.  The number of awards will be consistent with the agencys budget and the number of anticipated contracts. A Firm Fixed Price contract is anticipated. The government anticipates a one-year base period, with a one year option. The estimated start date is September 2009. This is a 100% small business set aside. The small business size standard for this procurement is a firm having as their average monthly number of employees over the last 12 months less than 500 employees. The government anticipates the solicitation document will be released on or about July 09, 2009.  The above noted Response Date is the date the government anticipates offers will be due. Questions concerning this notice should be addressed to Mr. Thomas Bouchard at thomas.bouchard@us.army.mil. Phone calls are not allowed.

<DESC>The US Coast Guard intends to award a sole source, firm fixed price contract or delivery order with two one-year options to Motorola Corporation for the Motorola CENTRACOM Gold Elite Embassy/Ambassador class of remote radio control systems.  The US Coast Guard, Rescue 21 Project Resident Office Alaska (R21 PRO AK) has a requirement to upgrade and expand existing Motorola CENTRACOM Gold Elite radio control equipment currently installed at the 17th Coast Guard District (D17) in Juneau, Anchorage, Valdez, Ketchikan and Sitka Alaska.  Motorola Corporation is the sole manufacturer of the equipment required to upgrade the existing CENTRACOM Gold Elite equipment to the CENTRACOM Gold Elite Embassy/Ambassador class system.  The Embassy/ Ambassador upgrade will support both legacy Coast Guard D17 National Distress System radio sites and future R21 PRO AK sites with the same console system, and will reuse over 95% of existing Coast Guard owned console hardware as its baseline.

These are commercial off the shelf (COTS) items.  Total cost of the necessary upgrades is estimated at $3.5 million. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334220; the size standard is 750 employees. The period of performance for the supplies and services described herein is anticipated to be FY2010 through FY2012.
  
The intended sole source award is under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2) for products and services not available on GSA Schedule.  Products and services available on GSA Schedule will be purchased under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program (8.401) and anticipated to be available on Schedule 70 General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software and Services.   Complete replacement of the existing Motorola equipment with a new system would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.

Interested parties with questions or comments regarding this notice or the planned procurement should be submitted to the Contracting Officer, in writing, no later than 15 days from the date of posting.

<DESC>SERIALS SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES

This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.

BACKGROUND
The Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Biosciences Library requires serial subscription services to include qualified personnel, field management, facilities, equipment, supplies and financial resources to place new and renewal subscriptions to domestic and foreign serials, periodicals, newsletters, and full-text online resources in print and online formats.  The services required will also include a range of related services, reports, 24-hour Internet access to the service providers online database, and troubleshooting with publishers.   

The FDA Biosciences Library (here and after known as FBSL) provides the Agency with research and information services.  The FDA Main Library (here and after known as FBSL) is located at 10903 New Hampshire Ave. WO2 Room 3051, Silver Spring, MD.  There are two branch libraries, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Branch (CFSAN) in College Park, MD, and the National Center for Toxicological Research Branch in Jefferson, AR.  

The FBSL will place new or renewal orders for approximately 1,200 journal titles with approximately 20% of these in print only format.  The titles remaining are in electronic full text format or electronic plus print combination titles.  These titles are ordered from numerous publishers including some aggregated title lists, through a contractor.  The electronic journals are maintained in a separate list. For selected titles/collections, FBSL submits publisher pricing as negotiated with the publishers to the serials contractor, who places the orders with the publishers.  There will be delivery orders with a separate account for electronic journals and for the print at each ship-to location.      

There will be multiple ship-to-addresses managed by the FBSL.   Separate renewals, reports and invoices will be required for each location. Reports customized for each locations needs will be required.  A consolidated title list and title lists specific to each location are required for collection development purposes. 

The CFSAN Branch, located in College Park, MD currently has 100 active serial subscriptions.

The FBSL main library location at White Oak currently has 1,000 active serial subscriptions, some print only, some print and online, and some online only.

The FBSL is heavily journal based rather than book based because serials are the preferred format for publishing scientific research. For example, the FBSL renews about 1,200 journal titles (tracking more than 50,000 issues annually) for its collections. Also, the domestic to foreign title ratio for the renewal of journal subscriptions is about 95:5 (95% domestic, 5% foreign). 

The serials contractor receives invoices from publishers for electronic site license access as submitted by FBSL, and honors the price for site license access as agreed to and negotiated by FBSL with the publisher.   The serials contractor pays the publisher invoices in a timely manner so that there are no lapses in access to electronic journals and online information or receipt of print journals.  

Enhanced journal management services available to the FBSL electronically via the Web are essential to managing the complexity of this consolidated collection.  The serials Contractor must be able to provide such services for both domestic and foreign titles to FBSL via the web as: placing orders; processing claims; creating a searchable title list; building an electronic journal title list noting subscription start and end dates; e-journal licensing and registration tracking.  In addition, pay-per-view article purchasing is needed to assist in document delivery.

<p><strong>Introduction<br /></strong>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.&nbsp;
<p><strong>Background<br /></strong>The Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), was formed in 1986 to address the national research needs created by the advent and spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The mission of DAIDS is to help ensure an end to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by increasing basic knowledge of the pathogenesis and transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), supporting the development of therapies for HIV infection and its complications, supporting prevention strategies and the development of vaccines. The DAIDS Vaccine Research Program (VRP) supports basic, preclinical, and clinical research of candidate vaccines. VRP activities include (1) oversight of grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements that support preclinical and clinical vaccine research, (2) evaluation of the safety and efficacy of vaccine candidates, (3) promotion of research programs to discover novel vaccine strategies for the treatment and prevention of HIV, and (4) work with the pharmaceutical industry and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to facilitate the evaluation and approval of new vaccines.</p>
<p>Reliable laboratory data are essential to the clinical evaluation of candidate HIV vaccine platforms and immunogens. The data provide key information to investigators on the immunogenicity and efficacy of vaccine concepts and may be used to prioritize and/or reject potential vaccine designs and optimize vaccine candidates prior to clinical advancement. Presently there are multiple organizations conducting HIV-1 vaccine trials globally. In the absence of a single central laboratory to perform all assays for these trials, it is imperative that the data from multiple laboratories performing assays in support of single or multiple vaccine candidates are accurate and reproducible. Such standardization and validation allow for effective assessment and comparison of data for scientific evaluation and on which to base sound decisions about product advancement and/or product improvement. To support these efforts, the availability of validated assays, common reagents and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and the implementation of external quality assurance (EQA) programs to measure and monitor laboratory performance are essential.</p>
<p>In FY1998 NIAID DAIDS awarded a contract (N01-AI-85341) entitled "Laboratory Support for AIDS Vaccine and Other Prevention Trials" to SeraCare BioServices, Inc. to provide services that included: (1) management of EQA programs in national and international laboratories for interferon gamma (IFN&gamma;) ELISpot, intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), and adenovirus 5 neutralization assays; (2) maintenance and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) of a frozen bank of peripheral blood mononuclear cell specimens for EQA programs; (3) maintenance and QA/QC of a reagent bank for the EQA programs; and (4) development of an interferon gamma ELISpot kit under Good Manufacturing Practices for commercial application. The continued and expanded need for DAIDS EQA programs for additional immunological and virological assays requires the renewal and expansion of this contract.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong> <br />The objective of an External Quality Assurance Program Oversight Laboratory (EQAPOL) is includes support for development of the following:</p>
<p><strong>(1) Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) EQA program.&nbsp;<br /></strong>NIAID/DAIDS clinical trials often include immunological testing such as ELISpot, ICS determinations and T-cell subset immunophenotyping to be performed on frozen PBMCs at a central laboratory. Therefore, it is important to assess the ability of US and international site-associated laboratories (where blood is collected from volunteers enrolled in clinical protocols) to adequately process, cryopreserve, store and ship PBMCs. It is imperative that the quality, integrity, and functional viability of PBMCs is preserved throughout processing, freezing, storage, shipping and thawing as this will impact the immunological function of thawed cells in subsequent immunogenicity or endpoint assays.</p>
<p>The NIAID/DAIDS VRP has established a QA program for the isolation and cryopreservation of PBMCs from whole blood for laboratories that collect and process blood from NIAID/DAIDS-funded and/or -sponsored clinical trials. This program is designed to ensure consistent and acceptable standards for QA monitoring of PBMC Quality Indicators (QIs). The QIs include: cell yields, cell viability, and total time from blood collection to cryopreservation of PBMCs including processing time, and functional immunological assessments by ELISpot or other assays on randomly selected frozen PBMC.</p>
<p><strong>(2) ELISpot EQA Program<br /></strong>Historically DAIDS has provided an IFN&gamma; ELISpot assay EQA program to NIAID/DAIDS-supported and other interested research laboratories. The IFN&gamma; ELISpot proficiency testing program involves two annual tests using provided reagents (IFN&gamma; monoclonal antibody-coated plates, enzyme-conjugated antibodies, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) peptide pool stimulant reagents, and controls) and cryopreserved PBMCs with known reactivity to CMV and CEF. NIAID/DAIDS-supported laboratories participating in this program receive standardized protocols for cell counting and an IFN&gamma; ELISpot assay kit. The laboratories also have the option to use their in-house validated procedures and conduct the proficiency testing with the reagents, IFN&gamma; monoclonal antibody-coated plates, and PBMCs provided through DAIDS. Each participating laboratory reports the experimental results using an electronic template. In addition, the developed ELISpot plates used by the laboratory are shipped back to a central laboratory for re-counting under optimized conditions. Statistical assessment, troubleshooting, final reporting and discussion of results occurs between participating laboratories and NIAID/DAIDS.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Flow Cytometry EQA Program<br /></strong>NIAID/DAIDS conducts a flow cytometry-based ICS assay quality assurance program and is developing additional functional assay QA programs (e.g. Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) cell proliferation assay) that include biannual testing by NIAID/DAIDS-supported laboratories. Participating laboratories receive a recommended protocol and perform assays with the supplied cells and reagents. The laboratories report their data back via an electronic spreadsheet as well as provide access to the raw data for potential troubleshooting purposes.</p>
<p><strong>(4) Establish and Characterize Unique Clade Specific HIV Virus</strong> <strong>Panels&nbsp; </strong>NIAID/DAIDS is currently involved in the development of a characterized global HIV isolate repository. Current HIV viral panels are poorly characterized, more than 15 years old, and not representative of currently circulating strains. Clade B is the most frequent virus type in the Americas and in parts of Asia. Clade C strains are most prevalent in southern Africa and Asia and represent the most abundant genetic subtype worldwide. The spread of new infections with clades normally not present in those geographical areas throughout the globe, coupled with the virus' propensity to mutate and recombine has led to the identification of many new circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) of the virus. As new assays are developed to detect and monitor HIV infections there may be difficulties evaluating, comparing and validating these assays using existing available viral panels. For example, some of the more rare serotypes (such as F, H, O and CRFs) are missing from or incompletely characterized on current panels. There are very few G subtypes and the ones that are available are actually A/G recombinants. It is critical that endpoint assays be tested and optimized against all possible clades since in many cases vaccine candidate efficacy is evaluated by measuring viral load.</p>
<p>The development and refinement of an updated panel will be accomplished by NIAID/DAIDS collaborating with international blood banks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and field researchers to obtain blood samples from newly identified HIV (acute or recently) infected individuals with interesting, rare, or difficult to identify isolates. These will be evaluated, characterized, fully sequenced and added to a repository/database which can be included in virus panels for use in optimizing and validating viral load assay platforms.</p>
<p>EQAPOL will be integral to the overall VRP, DAIDS and NIAID mission by providing a mechanism to ensure that the assessment of clinical specimens from NIAID/DAIDS-sponsored vaccine trials and other clinical research is accurate, reliable, and reproducible. It will also ensure that trial data support product advancement and meet regulatory agency requirements. NIAID-sponsored domestic and international investigators, e.g., NIAID/DAIDS clinical trial networks and Partnership for AIDS Vaccine Evaluation partners (PAVE) (<a href="http://www.hivpave.org">http://www.hivpave.org</a>), and other NIAID Divisions will have access to these resources.</p>

<DESC>PURPOSE:  The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA 05Z) is hereby issuing a Request for Information (RFI) from all potential sources who may be interested in the development of energy reduction technologies and procedures for use on Naval vessels.  The Department of Navy's (DoN's) Maritime Working Group, as established by the Navy's Task Force Energy, is investigating emerging technologies, operational concepts and other types of initiatives that have the potential to positively change and secure the energy needs of the Navy's current and future fleet. This includes, but is not limited to, changing operational behaviors/policies for reducing fuel consumption; retrofitting the current fleet with energy efficient technologies/equipment; integrating energy efficient technologies/equipment into new designs; and utilizing energy sources which are abundantly sourced, cost stable and inflict minimal (to no harm) on the environment.
BACKGROUND:  Volatile and rapidly fluctuating energy costs are one of the top challenges for both our nation and the DoN.  Despite a reduction in force structure and increased conservation efforts over the past several years, the rapid increase in energy costs has placed significant pressure on the DoN Readiness budget. Energy management is an operational and strategic imperative. The DoN fuel tether has a direct impact on war fighting effectiveness.  The DoN mission is to conduct prompt and sustained combat operations.  To that end, the DoN must be able to maintain a forward presence, even in an anti-access environment.  Fuel efficiency enhances endurance, improves operational flexibility, and supports forward presence and distributed operations, while reducing vulnerability inherent in a long supply line. The DoN has created Task Force Energy (TFE) to deliver shore and tactical energy security, and to reduce our carbon footprint.  The Maritime Working Group is one of four functional working groups established by TFE, the others being Aviation, Expeditionary, and Shore. The Maritime Working Group is focused on delivering the strategic road map to achieve tactical energy reductions, energy efficient equipment, and increased petroleum energy security for all Navy Surface/Sub-Surface ships including the Military Sealift Command.  The Maritime Working Group is planning to release a Navy Energy Roadmap (Maritime) in the fall of 2009.  The purpose of this Roadmap is to outline what the Navy believes are the best avenues of opportunity to enable meeting the goals that will be part of the Navy's Strategic Energy Plan.  By providing this Roadmap, the Navy intends to drive investment within the Navy and by its industry and academic partners where it can be the most effective.  The Roadmap will also propose efforts required to develop and/or provide the right decision aids/toolset that will enable planners in force structure development and capabilities requirements to make smart energy decisions while maintaining required readiness levels.  The Roadmap will draw attention to future large energy demand signals that will require special attention to ensure early assessment of overall energy impact and close monitoring of these energy drivers.  Finally, the Roadmap will discuss the efforts required to bring about a change in culture, both within the operational forces and with their relationship with industry.  It will propose ways that energy can be conserved operationally, without impacting effectiveness, and suggest avenues where the Navy and industry can develop standards and requirements that will drive energy efficiency to the lowest component.
RESPONSES:  The Navy believes that it needs its Industry and Academic partners' input to fully perform the analysis required to develop the Roadmap.  This announcement, in parallel with upcoming Maritime Industry Day, currently planned for July 23, 2009 (Washington Navy Yard vicinity from 0900-1200), and Energy symposiums and workshops,are the Navy's attempt to actively engage industry in this effort.  The Navy is seeking technologies and operational concepts for all Navy manned and unmanned surface ships, submarines, carriers and Military Sealift Command ships that include, but are not limited to, Acquisition, Technology and Operational categories.  (1) The Acquisition category includes opportunities to make decisions (force structure, platform, technologies, and energy sources) based on energy demand early in the requirements analysis and definition stages.  (2) The Technology category seeks current and future fleet opportunities to introduce energy efficient architectures/technologies/equipments/sub-components and increase the use of energy sources which are abundantly sourced, cost stable and inflict minimal (to no) harm on the environment.  Within the Technology category, there are subcategories to be looked at for Architectures (propulsion, distribution, support systems); Hull & Propulsor (shapes, materials, appendages); Prime Movers (gas turbines, diesels); Generators (voltage, AC, DC, frequency); Transmission Systems (gears, motors, shafting, bearings, seals); Distribution (voltage, AC, DC, frequency); Power Conversion (transformers, inverters, rectifiers, drives, analog, solid state); Energy Storage (batteries, capacitors, flywheels); Controls and Automation - Energy Monitoring and Control System (EMCS)  (global, local, distributed, autonomous); Non-Combat System Electric Loads (AC plants, lighting, galley, pumps); Comb! at System Electric Loads (radars, C4I, rail guns, directed energy); Alternative Energy Sources and Energy Recovery Systems (sails, fuels, solar, non-petroleum); Materials (hull coating, components (e.g. piping, pump casing)); and Other (technologies not directly associated with the sub-categories above, but have the potential to contribute to reducing the overall energy needs of the ship or ship systems).  (3) The Operational category seeks opportunities to reduce fleet petroleum energy consumption through strategy, planning (efficient ship routing), and monitoring techniques/technologies that influence, incentivize, or drive change to the culture and behavior of fleet fuel consumption.  The timescales for the roadmap will be divided into 4 periods: (1) 5 Year Plan for technologies and operational concepts requiring little or no research and development which can be taken from current state of readiness to state of fleet operational readiness by 2015; (2) 10 Year Plan for technologies and operational concepts where operational effectiveness could be demonstrated to a state of fleet operational readiness by 2020; (3) 20 Year Plan for technologies and operational concepts that could be taken to fleet operational readiness by 2030; (4) and 30 Year Plan for technologies and operational concepts that could be taken to fleet operational readiness by 2040.  This RFI in no way binds the Government to offer contracts to responding companies. The information provided will assist the Navy in developing and further defining future procurement and acquisition strategies.  Responses should be submitted as a White Paper, between 5-10 pages in length. A cover page is required and shall have the words "Maritime Energy Concepts Proposal" no smaller than 20 point font. Additionally, include "Business Sensitive" and "For Official Use Only" if applicable.  Each White Paper shall contain an Abstract, a Concept Definition, and a Risk Definition.  The Abstract should include a brief technical overview, benefit description, a rough cost estimation of the associated development effort, and should identify the objective and applicable area as described above.  The Concept Definition section should describe the concept being proposed and its operational use scenarios. It should address the benefits to the Navy, fleet, and/or vessel as well as how the benefits can/should be measured.  Include technology characteristics such as weight, dimensions, projected efficiency gain, net efficiency, specific fuel consumption, kW/hr or BTU/hr consumed/delivered, maintenance, training, support and other characteristics as applicable.  Cost estimates should be included in the White Paper to include research & development, procurement, and maintenance cost.  Provide a schedule that outlines the effort required to develop the concept through full scale testing.  Describe the current maturity of the technology or operational concept.  Maturity of the technology can be defined using the Technology Readiness metrics found in Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) Deskbook May 2005.  Describe the prior success/failure of the technology or operational concept.  The Risk Definition section should identify and describe any risks and characterize both the likelihood of occurrence and effect to the system in the event of occurrence.  Defense and commercial contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate.  There will be no award in direct response to this RFI. The Navy plans to analyze responses for potential inclusion to energy strategy. The Navy reserves the right to request of any, none, or all proposals further inquiry.  NAVSEA requests your responses by 10:00 am (EST), on 29 July 2009.  However, submissions will be accepted after this date, but feedback may not be as timely or contribute to the Navy's strategic planning.  White Papers should be e-mailed to Mr. Michael Robinson at michael.robinson3@navy.mil and labeled with the solicitation number and "Maritime Energy Reduction Opportunities".  Questions can be submitted electronically to michael.robinson3@navy.mil.  Industry representatives interested in participation in the Maritime Industry Day shall e-mail their contact information to Michael Broderick at michael.r.broderick@jlha.com and will be notified when the event is planned; no further announcement of the Maritime Industry Day will be provided.  Detailed technical information provided shall be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider.  However, it is the intended purpose of these White Papers to contribute to the Roadmap.  As such, the White Paper shall clearly indicate any aspects that are sensitive and that would be restricted from further dissemination. All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government. NAVSEA may request further information regarding the capabilities of respondents to meet the requirements and may request a presentation and/or a site visit as deemed necessary.

SSP also plans and directs the development of training systems and equipment, the training of fleet personnel in the operations of the systems, provides for facilities; and has responsibility for fulfilling the terms of the U.S./U.K. Polaris Sales Agreement.NSWC Crane Division, Crane, IN is the in-service engineering agent for SSP and is assessing the feasibility of developing a RAILCAR DESIGN approved by SSP, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) and Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to support the transportation of an Active Inert Missile (AIM) in support of the program requirements of SSP.  The industry design chosen is to be released with full design disclosure to SSP/NSWC Crane.  NSWC Crane requires input from industry resources to refine their understanding of the technical feasibility, risk, and cost implications associated with this effort.  Specifically, this RFI documents a Government request to industry for a plan/approach associated with AIM railcar development and production based on section 2 below.  Industry provided information will be evaluated by the SSP Program Office, members of the NSWC Crane community, and possibly other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government.  This Request for Information is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government does not intend to pay for any information furnished pursuant to this RFI.
1.2	BACKGROUND
SSP transports AIMs and additional support equipment across the country via rail to multiple facilities and shipyards to meet mission requirements.  SSP future projections show the need to conduct additional AIM movements requiring the development of additional railcars.  The payload consists of the AIM, which is a cylindrical piece of equipment attached to a shipping fixture with a flat base, which sits on the railcar deck and held in place by two bulkheads attached to the decking.
2.	DISCUSSION
2.1	CAPABILITIES
SSP is seeking a RAILCAR DESIGN capable of transporting an AIM while conforming to all SSP requirements as well as AAR and FRA rules and regulations.  The design should be an industry standard design or as standard as possible to other industry railcar designs.  The required capability consists of two separate loading conditions which are listed below.    NSWC Crane will provide drawings of current design upon request.
Railcar characteristics for BOTH loading conditions:
Maximum extreme length from coupler to coupler is 73 feet Maximum extreme width is 10 feet 3 inches.  Deck height should not be taller than 4 feet 1 inch.  Railcar must have the ability to negotiate a turn with a radius of 125 feet.Railcar decking must be able to attach to the current bulkhead design. 
Loading Condition 1 (Dynamic - Transportation):
The first condition consists of a payload uniformly distributed between the truck centers on the railcar decking.  The payload is attached to the railcar decking through interfaces with two separate bulkhead assemblies on each end of the payload.  The bulkhead assemblies are attached to the railcar decking by bolts threaded into nut bars located in channels in the deck.  
Transportation payload is 235,000 lbs.Bulkhead assemblies (2 total) are 103 inches long by 118 inches wide by 17 inches tall.  Payload has a surface area of 500 inches long by 120 inches wide and has a center line approximately 72 inches from the bottom surface of the load.  
Loading Condition 2 (Static - Shipyard):
The second loading condition occurs during shipyard on/off loading.  The railcar enters the shipyard in loading condition 1.  Once in the shipyard the railcar is parked and chocks are placed at the wheels and hoisting equipment is attached to one end of the AIM.  Once the hoisting equipment is attached a shipyard crane connects to the hoisting equipment.  Finally, the crane upends the AIM from the horizontal position to a vertical position.  The shipping fixture remains attached to the deck while the AIM rotates on trunions, which are a part of the shipping fixture.
When in the vertical position a load of 215,000 lbs is located over one end of the railcar.Same bulkhead assemblies and payload surface area as Loading Condition 1.
2.2	INTERFACE DEFINITION
Below is a listing of interface and performance considerations.    NSWC Crane will provide drawings of current design upon request.  Government Furnished Information (GFI) will be provided by NSWC Crane/SSP as requested.

STATEMENT of Objectives
Background:  The Office of Surface Mining (OSM), Technical Innovation and Professional Services (TIPS) branch is soliciting bids for Trimble GPS mapping grade equipment to seamlessly integrate with existing core mobile computing hardware and software.  The equipment and software must routinely provide submeter or better accuracy, be Bluetooth-enabled, and capable of generating a variety of discrete data files and mobile computing data file formats that match legacy datasets including shapefile formats, .ssf, .cor and .dxt.  The system components must be capable of being assembled without connecting cables or adapters.  Handheld units must be ruggedized and capable of displaying GIS/CAD Shapefile, ssf, cor, dxf formats and running the preloaded ArcPAD or TerraSync software to ensure compatibility with existing equipment.  The software must be compatible with the hardware used so as to generate accuracy estimates and provide mandated metadata to FDGC standards.  GPS data generated must be correctable using CORS, other terrestrial beacon sources, or satellite correction services, including the WAAS system.  Hardware and software must be directly compatible with the most prevalent models of GPS hardware and software used by other Federal agencies, states, Tribes, and industry in order to expedite the analysis of field conditions in surface mine reclamation.One of the founding tenets of OSMs TIPS service is to provide a common set of tools to Surface Mining Control Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) agencies to enable sharing of data and a common source of SMCRA enforcement nationwide.  These products are core components of current TIPS services.The bureau has an extensive training, support, and expertise investment developed over 16 years in Trimble software and hardware and adoption of other vendors products would introduce an unwarranted re-training and support expense.  In addition, state and Tribal programs, the FWS, BIA, BLM and industry are heavy users of Trimble products and this compatibility would be lost if another vendors products are selected.  Over 250 TIPS customers have been trained in Trimble products.
Deliverables/Warranty:  The Contractor shall provide a minimum of a One (1) Year Warranty.  This warranty must cover non-consumable parts and labor.  Quotation must include unlimited telephone/e-mail support, during the warranty period, for questions regarding operation.  Warranty shall be return to vendor as deemed necessary by OSM and all shipping charges will be the Vendors responsibility to and from training location site.Evaluation criteria for selection of quote:  Lowest Price/Technically Acceptable.  The Government will evaluate information based on the following criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor Meeting the Requirement, and 2) price.

<DESC><p>Battelle, Pacific Northwest Division, Management &amp; Operating Contractor of the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is requesting information from prospective offers to provide: <br />Field Emission High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope <br />A new generation high resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) with a configuration optimized (and customized) to enable microscopy and spectroscopy is being planned as a major new capability for the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL), a national US Department of Energy (DOE) User Facility located at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). This instrument will be designed to allow microscopy and spectroscopy measurements relevant to catalytic and geochemical studies of importance to energy and environmental applications. Because EMSL is a user facility, we are looking for ease of operation, friendly for user training and operation, high instrument durability and excellent instrument service. The system envisioned is a high resolution electron microscope that should be able to provide the following capabilities:
<p>(1) High resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging<br />(2) high spatial resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging<br />(3) High energy resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS)<br />(4) Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system<br />(5) Image acquisition and recording systems</p>
<p>To answer important questions about the interfacial and defect control of catalytic reactions and the chemical nature of nanoparticles, the microscope shall be equipped with an electron beam with low energy spread and high resolution electron energy loss detector. This will allow detailed chemical information to be obtained with an energy resolution of about 0.3 eV to 0.8 eV or better in electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). To obtain important information about the role of interface and particle structure on chemical reactivity, the microscope will need to have a point to point resolution better than 1.9 Angstrom (0.19 nm) for TEM imaging and a resolution of better than 1.0 Angstrom (0.1 nm) for STEM bright and dark field imaging. To achieve the STEM resolution, the microscope will need to have an aberration corrector for the STEM probe forming lens (Cs-probe corrector). Gatan image filter (GIF) should be incorporated to energy filtered imaging technique and an energy dispersive x-ray detector system should be incorporated for chemical composition analysis. <br />Interested firms shall also provide information in the following areas as available:<br />1) A description of current experience, knowledge and capabilities directly applicable to the performance of the scope identified.<br />2) Brochures providing descriptions of equipment, maintenance and standard warranty, along with a current published commercial pricelist.<br />This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort that will best address PNNL's needs. This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation. Battelle does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI. <br />Please provide your expression of interest to the attention of the points of contact listed above.<br />If you have questions or need additional information, they must also be submitted in writing to the points of contact.</p>

The slab in the area used to be on grade. However, during the CRC construction, the area was excavated, hence the slab is now open. In addition, the existing slab was also cut to route electrical conduits to the MRI. Heavy-duty scaffolding shall be erected that will clear suspended rods that support the lead-lined pipe and support the duct; that will also allow erecting structural steel in N.S. and E.W. directions to strengthen support of concrete bulge area. Erector is not to install, nor use any bolting into overhead concrete for his work - including hoisting the structural steel beams up to location.

Structural steel Contractor shall take final measurements, specify erection sequence, indicate splice locations of steel beams, indicate locations where east-west structural steel cross members could be located to avoid existing suspended rod supports. (Structural design would account for steel detailer and steel erectors needs for splice locations to erect the steel beams. Measurements shall note areas in the east-west direction for structural steel that would allow avoiding the existing lead-lined pipe and duct suspenders.) Provide redundant support to new steel beams for existing lead-lined pipe and duct. The Structural Steel erector shall schedule work ahead of time so the MRI operation can be informed of the erection timing. No internal Combustion Engine shall be used inside the work area without approved ventilation system.</p>

<p>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: Selection will be made for at least one Small Business Set-aside and at least one Full and Open Competition Contract. The contract(s) will be Indefinite Delivery type Services Contracts having a five-year period of performance with no options. Individual task orders under the contract(s) will be of the cost-plus fixed fee or firm-fixed price type. The Joint Total Acquisition Value (JTAV) for these contracts is $9,975,000.00. Each task order will not be limited other than the contract value. The contract(s) will have a guaranteed minimum of $25,000 for the contract period. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 36.6 (Brooks Act) procedures will be used to acquire these services. If more than one contract award is made, then multiple award procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b) will be utilized to the maximum extent practicable to provide a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order. Vendors may only receive one (1) contract as a result of this solicitation. The following criteria may be used in allocating orders: (1) Performance; (2) Quality of deliverable; (3) Current contract capacity; (4) Specialized experience; (5) Past Performance; and (6) Other related factors. Exceptions to this procedure are found in FAR 16.505(b)(2). It is anticipated that at least the first contract will be awarded in the first or second quarter, FY2010. One or more months may elapse between the contract awards. NAICS 562910. Small business size standard is 500 employees. NAICS 562910 - Environmental Remediation Services.</p>
<p>2. <br />a) For SBA assistance as a small business concern in the industry of Environmental Remediation Services, other than for Government procurement, a concern must be engaged primarily in furnishing a range of services for the remediation of a contaminated environment to an acceptable condition including, but not limited to, preliminary assessment, site inspection, testing, remedial investigation, feasibility studies, remedial design, containment, remedial action, removal of contaminated materials, storage of contaminated materials and security and site closeouts. If one of such activities accounts for 50 percent or more of a concern's total revenues, employees, or other related factors, the concern's primary industry is that of the particular industry and not the Environmental Remediation Services Industry.</p>
<p>b) For purposes of classifying Government procurement as Environmental Remediation Services, the general purpose of the procurement must be to restore or directly support the restoration of a contaminated environment. This includes activities such as preliminary assessment, site inspection, testing, remedial investigation, feasibility studies, remedial design, remediation services, containment, and removal of contaminated materials or security and site closeouts. The general purpose of the procurement need not necessarily include remedial actions. Also, the procurement must be composed of activities in three or more separate industries with separate NAICS codes or, in some instances (e.g., engineering), smaller sub-components of NAICS codes with separate and distinct size standards. These activities may include, but are not limited to separate activities in industries such as: Heavy Construction; Special Trade Contractors; Engineering Services; Architectural Services; Management Consulting Services; Hazardous and Other Waster Collection; Remediation Services; Testing Laboratories; and Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences. If any activity in the procurement can be identified with a separate NAICS code, or component of a code with a separate distinct size standard, and that industry accounts for 50 percent or more of the value of the entire procurement, then the proper size standard is the one for that particular industry, and not the Environmental Remediation Service size standard. This procurement includes work under at least three NAICS codes, none of which accounts for 50 percent or more of the procurement.</p>
<p>3. PROJECT INFORMATION: The contracts will include assessments, investigations, design, and engineering services leading to and including services for construction oversight activities and overall project management of these services, in support of the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)'s Restoration Program which is a nationwide program and on an as needed basis, with other entities within NOAA.

<DESC>Development of applications utilizing the terahertz spectrum in fields such as medicine, remote sensing, and communications has been hampered by a lack of terahertz radiation generation and detection technology.  Sandia National Laboratories seeks to close that gap by developing its intellectual property (U.S. Patent Application 11/698,010 (Integrated heterodyne terahertz transceiver) and U.S. Patents 6,049,308 (Integrated resonant tunneling diode based antenna), 7,376,403 (Terahertz radiation mixer), and 7,420,225 (Direct detector for terahertz radiation)) in both terahertz radiation generation and detection.  Reasonable  investment is expected to produce viable, market-ready technologies.  Sandia invites interested parties to join with Sandia in developing the possibilities of the terahertz spectrum by partnering through a Work for Others (WFO) agreement, Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), and/or licensing agreement.  WFOs and CRADAs are expected to include funds-in to Sandia.  A negotiated license to the existing Sandia patents and patent application is available for reasonable consideration.  Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energys National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

<DESC>1) Question:  Is Government Housing/Billeting provided for Contractors?<BR><BR>Answer:  No.	<BR><BR>2) Question:  Do Contractors have access to Government Vehicles/Transportation Services?<BR><BR>Answer:  While performing official R2P2 duties, as specified in the PWS, Contractors will have access to and may utilize Government Furnished Vehicles.  However, the Contractor operators of those vehicles must have a valid Country/State License and ASG-QA Drivers Licenses in order to drive, per ACEN-ASG-QA-DOL Installation Functional Policy Letter Number 400, NTV Policy.  Also, Camp As Sayliyah does offer a Shuttle Bus Service that provides transportation 24 hours/day, 7 days/week to various on-camp destinations to include Gate #10, the DFAC, and AAFES.  Government vehicles may not be used for travel  between duty and domicile, per 31 USC 1344.<BR><BR>3) Question:  Do Contractors have access to the DFAC?  If so, is there a charge to the Contractor?  If so, what are the charges for meals?<BR><BR>Answer:  Yes, DFAC services are provided to those Contractor Employees who have CAC or Installation Access Cards.  The Contractor Employees will pay for every meal using an Eagle Cash Card.  It is the responsibility of each individual Contractor Employee to obtain an Eagle Cash Card through ASG-QA Finance Office.  Currently the cost for DFAC meals are as follows: Breakfast $2.30, Lunch $4.25, Dinner $4.25, and Mid-Night Meals $4.25.<BR><BR>4) Question:  Are the positions needed for this mission to be EXPATS?<BR><BR>Answer:  Only those positions identified in the PWS paragraph 3.0 need to be filled using EXPATS.<BR><BR>5) Question:  Can any position be TCNs?<BR><BR>Answer:  No, per PWS paragraph 3.0 there are certain positions that must be filled using EXPATs; however, it is up to the Contractor to propose their recommended EXPAT/TCN combination after meeting the mandatory EXPAT requirements.<BR><BR>6) Question:  What are the normal staffing hours and days per week?<BR><BR>Answer:  R2P2 is open for service members 24 hours a day/7 days a week and needs to be staffed as such, according to the requirements found in the PWS.<BR><BR>7) Question:  Are any positions supervisory or are they all subordinate positions that work under direction of the OIC/NCOIC?<BR><BR>Answer:  The only Contractor supervisory position required is the Program Manager position, as stated in the PWS, paragraph 3.0.  However, all Contractor personnel must report to the R2P2 OIC/NCOIC.<BR><BR>8) Question:  Do the escorts go to the venues or do they just escort to the gate and back?<BR><BR>Answer:  The responsibilities of the Escorts are identified in the PWS paragraph 4.5 as follows:  The escorts meet the Civilian Venue Buses and SUVs outside of Gate #10 and escort them through all gate procedures to the R2P2 Building parking lot, and back to the Gate once the venue has commenced.  The Contractor is also responsible for Wing Driver responsibilities, which are identified in the PWS paragraph 4.9.<BR><BR>9) Question:  Does the laundry mentioned in this solicitation only include the linens that the operation provides or does it include laundry for people on R&R?<BR><BR>Answer:  The only laundry operation that the contractor must provide is identified in PWS paragraph 4.10 (d), which states the contractor needs to, Drop off and pick up all donated clothing at the Installation Laundry Facility for laundering upon initial receipt and after worn by Service Members.  Count clothing donations in laundry basket and return laundered clothing to the closet racks.  R2P2 receives donated clothing for the Service Members to wear while they are at Camp As Sayliyah.  That being said, it is the responsibility of the contractor to take this clothing up to the base laundry facility upon receipt of the donation and after the Service Members return the clothing.  It is not, however, the responsibility of the contractor to launder the Service Members personal clothing.  <BR><BR>10) Question:  Are the escorts needed during the Night Shift?<BR><BR>Answer:  Yes, evening venues can conclude as late as 2200 and morning venues can begin as early as 0400.<BR><BR>11) Question:  Would the TCNs be living on base and should we include the processing of their work permit in their salary base?<BR><BR>Answer:  No, Contractor personnel are not authorized to live on Camp As Sayliyah, Qatar.  Because this solicitation will result in a Firm Fixed Price contract, the method the contractor uses to propose costs they anticipate incurring for personnel issues is up to them.  However, all costs proposed must be allocable, allowable and reasonable per FAR 31.201.<BR><BR>12) Question:  Are any of the employees eligible for per diem pay to cover food and lodging?<BR><BR>Answer:  Yes, according to the Per Diem, Travel and Transportation Allowance Committee Website, (http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/perdiem/perdiemrates.html), the maximum rates for all locations in Qatar for lodging, meals and incidental expenses are $227, $91, and $23 respectively.<BR><BR>13) Question:  When is the start date for this project?<BR><BR>Answer:  The start date will be no later than 60 days after the Contract Award Date.<BR><BR>14) Question:  Are EXPATs allowed Hardship and Hazardous Pay?  If the threat level were to change during performance of this contract, would this reflect on the EXPATs pay through invoicing the Government accordingly?<BR><BR>Answer:  As found on the US Department of State website, (http://aoprals.state.gov/Web920/location_action.asp?MenuHide=1&CountryCode=1168)<BR>EXPATs working in Qatar are allowed a 10% Hardship Pay, but are not authorized any Hazardous/Danger Pay.  That being said, if the Department of State was to change the Hardship and/or Hazardous/Danger Pay for the Qatar region during performance of this contract, the EXPATs would need to be paid accordingly.  However, being that this contract is set to be awarded as a Firm Fixed Price contract, the contractor would need to submit an official Request for Equitable Adjustment (REA) if they felt the Government needed to increase the contract amount to cover an increase in either of these allowances.  That being said, Contractors need to keep in mind that these REAs will not be taken lightly due to the type of contract this requirement will be under, and it needs to be remembered that the allowable pay adjustments may also go down as well throughout performance of this contract.<BR><BR>15) Question:  Who will be in charge of any costs related to the National Agency Check clearance, if any?<BR><BR>Answer:  The Contractor is responsible for all necessary security/background checks.  The costs associated with such security measures may be something that is considered in the Contractors proposal.  All costs must be in accordance with FAR 31.<BR>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p>Factor 5 - Enhanced 911 Service. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911. <br /><br /><br />(b) Price Evaluation. <br />(i) All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B to derive the total evaluated price. CLIN X004 estimated amount of $500.00 is for evaluation purposes only and will be used to evaluate each offeror's proposal for taxes, fees, and surcharges. Upon award, the awardee must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable taxes, fees, and surcharges. Only those taxes, fees, and surcharges that are documented as applicable and allowable will be accepted; the resulting contract will be modified to add those actual fixed prices. Moreover, contract CLIN X004 must be modified for actual prices prior to the awardee invoicing for CLIN X004. The awardee may neither request nor invoice for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt and for any taxes not added by modification. <br /><br />(ii) The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the <br />Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any<br />other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.

<DESC>NASA intends to extend Contract NNA04CA76C with Planners Collaborative, Inc. on asole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.  Theobjective is to extend the performance period for four months. The current Contractor provides support for users and occupants of Ames Research Centerunder Business Operations and Technical Services (BOATS). The principal purpose of thiscontract is to provide a variety of professional and para-professional functions tovarious divisions at NASA-ARC.	 The Contractor provides support for scientific andtechnical information, including video, photo, publications, printing and libraryservices; human resource management and training; acquisitions; equal opportunity andaffirmative action; commercial technology; public affairs and education outreach; legaloffice; and related administrative programs.. This extension will allow for acontinuation of services to ensure program continuity and critical mission support andavoid significant technical impacts while a competitive follow-on acquisition iscompleted. The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NNA04CA76C,value and extend the period of performance for a period of four months, from December 29,2008 through April 28, 2009. The current contractor, Planners Collaborative, Inc. isconsidered the only contractor that can meet ARCs needs given the short period ofperformance for the extension.

Factor 1  Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Governments requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of descriptive literature that clearly indicates what the offeror is proposing and will be providing all products in accordance with the stated characteristics in the list of Salient Characteristics included elsewhere in this solicitation.  Descriptive literature means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quote.  Descriptive literature is required to establish that, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered meet the specifications in the list of Salient Characteristics.  The information is required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  
                                              
Factor 2  Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offerors record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offerors adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offerors reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offerors business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quote will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.
  
FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and ConditionsCommercial Items (MAR 2009)  Addenda to 52.212-4; the following clauses apply:
FAR 52.247-34 FOB Destination (NOV 1991)

52.211-9  DESIRED AND REQUIRED TIME OF DELIVERY (JUN 1997)
(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:
DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE  All items within 30 days after date of contract award.
If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below. However, the offerors proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Governments required delivery schedule as follows:
REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE  All items within 60 days after date of contract award.
Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.
OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE:  All items within _____ days after date of contract award.
(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractors date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term working day excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.

(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, titled, "Evaluation of Commercial Items" (JAN 1999), is applicable to this acquisition.  

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes and are listed in descending order of importance:

TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING:
To determine technical merit, each quotation will be evaluated against the requirements listed in this solicitation. All vendors offering an "Equal To" product must provide supporting documentation that their product can meet the requirements listed in this solicitation.  1)  The proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, Acceptable, or Unacceptable.  A score of Acceptable would mean that the proposed product fully met the requirements.  An Unacceptable score means that the offer will not be considered for award.

PAST PERFORMANCE: 
Vendors should provide two references of similar efforts performed during the last three years. This will include a description of the project, project title, contract number, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official name(s), address and telephone number. The government is seeking to determine whether an offeror has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and high performance of services.  This is a matter of judgment.  The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offerors likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offerors past performance record.  Rating of positive, neutral, and poor will be given.  A positive past performance will take precedence over neutral or poor past performance.  Neutral past performance takes precedence over poor past performance.  A contractor with no past performance will be given a score of neutral, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offerors likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offerors record of past performance. 

PRICE:
The Government will evaluate proposed prices for a base period plus four options.  Price is of less importance than technical capabilities and past performance combined.  Award will not be automatically made on the basis of the highest technical merit. However price may become an important factor as the degree of equality between technical proposals becomes closer.  FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990) applies to this procurement.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(x) Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (JUN 2009).   This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.  The contracting officer will review the vendors online certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov to ensure that they are accurate and complete.  If the vendor does not have active representations and certifications registered online they will be disqualified from being considered for award.

(xi) The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (MAR 2009), applies to this acquisition.

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health wishes to procure QMassMR and Qflow proprietary software packages from Medis Medical Imaging Systems. The product will be used to analyze and compare new images obtained ath the NIH with approximately 10,000 historical radiologic studies anazlyzed elsewhere usinf QMassMR annd Qflow. Using software packages other than QMASSE andQflow would therefore make it almost impossible to continue these long term studies without re-analyzing the data which would be extremenly costly in both manpower and time. It is therefore in the best interest of the Government and the clinical protocol that QMass and Qflow be procured.</p>

The contractor will be responsible for providing and operating a vessel in support of the U.S. Coast Guards aviation training program.  Specifically, the contractor shall provide all necessary management, supervision, personnel, labor, materials, fuel, and equipment necessary for the vessel to support helicopter hoisting and fixed wing aerial delivery evolutions by Air Station aircraft. 

1.1  Background:  One of the Coast Guards primary missions is Search and Rescue.  In order for the Air Station to fulfill this mission, it is necessary to conduct helicopter hoists of equipment to/from underway vessels, helicopter delivery/recovery of rescue swimmers to/from the water, and fixed wing aerial delivery of dewatering pumps and other equipment to the water.  These skill sets require both initial and proficiency training for Coast Guard pilots and aircrews. This training requires small boat support.  The U.S. Coast Guards increased OPTEMPO and Homeland Security mission has reduced the availability of Coast Guard small boats and crews to provide support for required aviation training.  

1.2  Vessel Description:  The vessel shall be no smaller than 38 feet and no longer than 65 feet in length and shall have at least a 11 foot beam.  The maximum draft of the vessel shall not exceed 4 feet.  Gross vessel weight shall be a minimum of 10 tons.

The vessel must be capable of maintaining a heading of + / - 10 degrees at 5 knots while operating under a large helicopter producing 90 knots of rotor downwash in varying sea states and winds.  An extremely shallow draft vessel is undesirable due to drift characteristics when subjected to rotor downwash.  The vessel must have no permanent structures protruding higher than 20 feet above the water line which cannot be quickly stowed (e.g. antennas).

1.2.2  Required Deck Area:  The minimum deck area is 64 sq ft on the aft (fantail) portion of the vessel to allow two crew members to safely conduct operations.  The deck area must be free of all obstructions.

1.2.3  Vessel Equipment:  The vessel shall have, at a minimum, all equipment required by law including a fathometer, radar, VHF-FM multiple frequency capable 2 way marine radio with specified frequencies/channels (13, 16, 21, 22, 23, 81, 83) and minimum ranges (20 NM), a cell phone for secondary communications to the Air Station Miami Operations Center, GPS, and a long distance high beam search light. 

1.2.4  Safety Equipment:  The vessel shall be outfitted with a contractor furnished first aid kit and approved Type III personal flotation devices for crew and passengers.  Survival suits shall be provided, by the contractor, as needed for crew members allowing them to operate on the weather deck / under rotor downwash continuously in temperatures ranging from 5 degrees C. to 40 degrees C.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS, is attached.
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program 
It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 

Department of Homeland Security 
United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)

<DESC><p><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the solicitation. The NAICS Code is 562910 with a size standard of $14 M. The reference number is H94003-09-T-0005. This requirement is to provide emergency response services to Defense Microelectronics Activity (DMEA), 4234 54th St, McClellan, CA. The emergency response provider will provide containment, clean-up, remediation, and/or hazardous materials/waste when requested by DMEA. The purpose of this contract is to provide emergency response to DMEA in the event that these services would be required. The emergency response provider shall be required to provide containment, clean-up, remediation, and disposal of hazardous materials/waste resulting from a spill or release of any of the hazardous materials stored or processed at DMEA or transported from our facility to another site. Requirements: The emergency response contractor must have technically qualified personnel on the emergency response team. The personnel must be adequately trained and have sufficient experience to handle any type of spill or release that might be encountered at DMEA (see attached chemical list). This shall include the technical services of a certified industrial hygienist, chemist, environmental engineer, certified health physicist, etc. All emergency responders must have a minimum 40 hour HAZWOPER training (compliance with 29 CFR 1910.120 and CCR, Title 8, 5192), and 1 year experience of responding to various chemical spills within the state of California. At the direction of DMEA, the contractor will be required to respond to chemical spills/releases during the transportation of DMEA hazardous wastes or materials. This could include responses anywhere along the transportation routes and therefore the emergency contractor must have multiple emergency response teams that would be able to respond within a reasonable amount of time (3 hours or less). The contractor must have the capability to respond at the discretion of DMEA to emergencies any time the need arises. The requirement is for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week including holidays and weekends. The contractor, at the direction of DMEA, will be required to properly dispose of the hazardous wastes that are generated from a spill/release. This includes as a minimum hazardous waste characterization (if required), labeling/placarding, manifesting, and transportation to a licensed hazardous waste disposal site. The emergency response contractor must have a wide range of emergency response equipment suitable for spill containment and clean-up operations. This includes but not limited to vehicles/vacuum pumps to suction hazardous waste liquids (concentrated acids and bases including hydrofluoric acid), hazardous waste drums/portable tanks, and personal protective equipment up to and including Level A suits. The emergency response service provider shall provide DMEA with a single call number that will activate an emergency response team with the capability to properly handle any type of spill/release that could be encountered at DMEA. DMEA must be able to speak with a "live" member of the emergency response team who is knowledgeable regarding hazardous materials and emergency response and not to a dispatch service (operator) who would have to contact others to response to technical questions. The person who answers the emergency telephone call shall have as a minimum 40 hour HAZWOPER training and one year experience responding to chemical spills. The emergency response time shall not be greater than three hours from the time the emergency response call is initiated by DMEA. The preference is to have the emergency response team on-site as soon as possible, but within 1 to 2 hours from the time the emergency response contractor is notified. All responders must comply with all federal, state, and local requirements including the mandated training requirements. The contractor shall not discuss the nature or extent of their involvement with any incident involving DMEA facility, chemicals, or processes with any other agencies (including the media) or other individuals without prior permission from DMEA. The contractor shall have liability insurance. The liability insurance shall be a minimum of $1,000,000 (USD). After the emergency contractor has responded to an incident, the contractor shall provide a written report within 48 hours to DMEA's Environmental, Health and Safety Manager. This report shall include the nature and extent of the spill/release, procedures to contain and/or mitigate the hazardous chemicals, notifications made to any agencies, results of any sampling or monitoring, and any other pertinent information related to the spill/release as deemed necessary by DMEA. It is anticipated this contract will be awarded as a time and materials contract. The duration of this contract will be for the initial year that the contract/agreement is consummated plus two option years. Proposal Submissions: A current emergency response price schedule shall be provided to DMEA Contracting (MEE). The price schedule shall include the labor rates for the different positions (e.g. certified industrial hygienist, chemist, technician, etc.), costs associated with the personal protective equipment (e.g. Level A suits, Tyvek suits, gloves, respirators, etc.), costs for various types of materials (e.g. overpack drums, booms, liners, etc.) and any other miscellaneous supplies or equipment. Provide the list of names of individuals with their education, experience and training as it pertains to emergency response for those who could be requested to respond to a chemical emergency at DMEA. Provide two examples of chemical emergencies that the contractor was called upon to mitigate. These examples shall include the nature and extent of the emergency response including the containment and clean up; however, for privacy reasons the contractor does not have include the name and location of the incident. Security: As a Department of Defense facility, access to DMEA is limited to authorized US citizens only. All emergency personnel responding to DMEA must be citizens of the United States of America. A list of names of the potential emergency responders must be provided in advance to DMEA and must be updated as necessary. Emergency response personnel may require a background check prior to working on-site. DMEA reserves the right to preclude access to our facility any of the contractor personnel for security concerns. Selection Criteria: The contractor shall be selected based upon best value from qualified and responsive offerors. The selection criteria include experience in emergency response within the semi-conductor industry, equipment available, response team members' education/training, response time, and costs.</p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(a) This solicitation may be protested to the issuing Contracting Office for decision by the Contracting Officer or by the Chief of the Regional Contracting Center if authority has been withheld. If requested, an independent review of an Agency Protest decision is available through appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC) in accordance with FAR 33.103. A JCC-I/A is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103. The JCC-I/A Agency Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within JCC-I/A, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. After an interested party files an Agency Protest with the Contracting Officer and while that protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the Agency Protest, the Agency Protest will be dismissed.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(b) An interested party may file a written protest to the Contracting Officer under the JCC-I/A Agency Protest program for contract solicitations issued by JCC-I/A. Such Agency Protests are limited to objections to any of the following: </span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The cancellation of the solicitation or other request.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(3) An award or proposed award of the contract.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(c) <em>Voluntary Automatic Stay</em>. This provision describes the circumstances under which JCC-I/A voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Agency Protest, as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4).</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(1) In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest. This is known as an "automatic stay" and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the GAO under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a "Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay"). However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden. This is known as an automatic stay "override."</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(2) The CICA stay applies only if the GAO protest is filed within 10 days from notice of award, or within 5 days of a required debriefing. A firm may file a JCC-I/A Agency Protest and, if it is dissatisfied with the agency's protest decision, may wish to file a follow-on GAO protest. Under normal circumstances, a protester that goes to the GAO after receiving an adverse agency decision will find that the GAO may take jurisdiction and actually render a recommendation, but that the CICA Stay no longer applies.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(3) The JCC-I/A voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract when an interested party files a timely protest under the JCC-I/A Agency Protest Program. Should the interested party disagree with the Contracting Officer's or RCC/Division Chief's resolution of an Agency Protest, it may appeal to the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC) or utilize another protest forum. The JCC-I/A Voluntary Automatic Stay extends the protester's right to preserve the status quo pending resolution of all protests with respect to a particular contract action. In return for the protester's initially filing its protest as an Agency Protest instead of with the GAO, the contracting officer agrees that, if the protester ultimately disagrees with the Contracting Officer or RCC/Division Chief's decision and files a GAO protest, the agency will agree not to proceed with performance just as it would have done if the protester had filed its protest with the GAO right from the start. This means that in an Agency Protest, the agency may override the stay under the same standards and circumstances as would have applied if the protest had originally been filed with the GAO. Nothing in this provision adversely affects an interested party's rights to protest a contract action to the GAO, or to seek other relief related to the action.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(4) However, an appeal and review of the Contracting Officer's Agency Protest decision by the PARC will not extend the GAO's timeliness requirements. Therefore, any subsequent protest to the GAO must be filed within 10 days of receipt of the Contracting Officer's Agency Protest decision.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(d) An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (g) of this provision for resolution of protests.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(e) For the purpose of filing a JCC-I/A Agency Protest, an interested party means an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(f) An Agency Protest must include the protester's name, address and telephone number, including fax number or e-mail address; the solicitation or contract number, identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer's name; a detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of Contracting Officers does not constitute grounds for protest), including copies of all relevant documents; a request for a ruling; and, a request for relief. All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester and must state it is an Agency Protest for decision by the Contracting Officer.</span></p>
<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">(g) JCC-I/A Agency Protests, as defined in FAR 33.101, may be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from JCC-I/A, Regional Contracting Office-Taji, email: </span><a href="mailto:taji.RCC@iraq.centcom.mil"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">taji.RCC@iraq.centcom.mil</span></a><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">. <strong></strong></span></p>

<DESC>BELOW ARE ALL THE QUESTIONS RECEIVED WITHIN THE STATED TIME FRAME WITH ANSWERS FOLLOWING:<BR><BR>1) The specs you sent for this RFQ make reference to some MIL STD testing.  One is MIL STD 810F Method 503.4. This is a thermal shock test, and requires two chambers.<BR> <BR>Answer to 1:<BR>Thermal shock testing capability is not a requirement for this test chamber.  Any reference to thermal shock testing is an error to be disregarded. <BR> <BR><BR><BR>2) Solicitation calls for a panel room design, we feel that based on the size and performance requirements a solid construction (one piece) chamber featuring fully welded seams would be a much more robust design adding years of service. Would this be acceptable?<BR><BR>Answer to 2: <BR>A one piece solid construction designed chamber is acceptable if it will fit through the garage door into the limited space of the building.  The garage door is 10ft x 10ft; the floor space is 12ft x 60ft; ceiling height is sloping from 10 ft to 8 ft.  The garage door is on the long side of the building (60ft).  Unfortunately, this is a tight squeeze for a one piece chamber, but if it can be done in sections it may be feasible.<BR>    <BR><BR>3) Specifications callout MIL-STD-810F, regarding 503.4, this is a thermal shock test which is defined in the specification as sudden changes in temperature of greater than 10C per minute. ALSO STATES The required apparatus consists of two chambers or cabinets, or a two celled chamber in which test conditions can be established. A chamber this size with 7.5 HP compressors cannot meet the 10C per minute rate. How will the chamber be applied or used to this specification?<BR><BR>Answer to 3 is the same as answer 1.<BR><BR><BR>4) Solicitation calls out for Rear Mounted Operational Equipment Module: shall be composed of the same insulating material as the chamber. In our view there is no reason to insulate a machinery section with 4 inch thick foamed in place urethane etc. We can provide a noise absorption insulation on the removable panels. Is this acceptable?<BR><BR>Answer to 4:  Yes<BR><BR><BR>5) Same subject, module shall be designed to interface to a pre-fabricated hole in the rear wall of the chamber. We feel that based on MIL-STD-810F an interior plenum, housing the evaporators, heaters etc would be a better approach. The machinery section (compressors, humidifier etc) would be attached to the rear of the chamber. Is this an acceptable design?<BR><BR>Answer to 5:  yes<BR><BR><BR>6) Load information - a) Live load? b) Static load? c) What are they putting in the chamber? d) How fast do they need the temperature to transition?<BR><BR>Answer to 6:  Assume: A live load of 2 KW; A static load of 100 lb Aluminum; A transition time of 90 minutes or less from 72 F to -40 F.  Specific items to be tested are unknown (in general they are military medical devices).

<DESC>IMPORTANT NOTICE:  THE CLOSING DATE FOR THE QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENT HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON JULY 10, 2009 TO THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON JULY 14, 2009.  ALL PERSPECTIVE OFFERORS MUST HAVE THEIR DEMONSTRATIONS PROVIDED BY THAT TIME IN ORDER TO BE QUALIFIED FOR AN AWARD.BACKGROUND: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Integrated Service Network 10 (VISN 10) has the need for a contractor to furnish an automated scheduling system and the requisite hardware necessary for its implementation and maintenance within the VA's nursing workforce.  The software will must be able to have the flexibility to be customized based on the needs of the various VA facilities located within the VISN, must be capable of predicting workload demands for clinical care, and have the ability to generate reports to optimize staffing levels. COVERAGE AREA: Proposed systems must be able to reach the VA Medical Centers and all associated facilities located within VISN 10, including but not limited to: The Dayton VA Medical Center, located at 4100 West Third Street, Dayton, OH 45428; The Cincinnati VA Medical Center, located at 3200 Vine St., Cincinnati, OH, 45220; The Chillicothe VA Medical Center, located at 17273 State Route 104, Chillicothe, OH 45601; The Chalmers P. Wylie Veterans Clinic, located at 420 North James Road, Columbus, OH 43219; and The Cleveland VA Medical Center, located at 10000 Brecksville Road, Brecksville, OH 44141.  SET-ASIDE INFORMATION: This procurement is a 100% set-aside for a Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Concern. The SDVOSB must be small under the relevant North American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) code and MUST be registered and verified in the following websites: http://www.vip.vetbiz.gov, http://ccr.gov, and http://orca.bpn.gov and Vets 100 to be eligible for award.  Offerors MUST ensure registration in these websites are accurate and have not expired prior to the solicitation due date.  This procurement shall be procured and awarded using the commercial item procedures. The applicable NAICS Code is 541511. The contract value is estimated to be approximately $500,000.00.IMPORTANT NOTICE:  This procurement will have a qualification requirement associated with its award.  ALL contractors seeking to place an offer or bid for this requirement MUST BE PRE-QUALIFIED BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER in order to be eligible for an award.  To be added to the 'Pre-Qualified List' contractors must demonstrate that they can provide software that can meet the following requirements in a presentation format, either via the internet or a pre-recorded median (CD, Video, Windows Media File, etc.), that is not to exceed two (2) hours in length:1.	Help screen shall be available to all levels of users.  System is user friendly; designed for all personnel's levels of computer skills, novice to moderate working knowledge, and maneuvers straightforwardly and simply amongst modules and platforms. 2.	The software shall be able to identify minimum and maximum staffing levels, based on HPPD (hours per patient day) and census.  In other words, based on the HPPD for that level of unit and the census, the software should be able to tell the supervisor if the unit is over staffed, staffed appropriately or under staffed.  In addition, it should be able to show the manager that the variance is by either hours and FTE (full time equivalent).3.	The software shall be able to manage any combination of shift length; float staff; individual preferences, on-call and rotating shifts.  For example, it should be able to manage both 8 hour and 12 hour tours for one person to make 80 hours/pay period.  4.	The application shall track changes to the schedule by date, time, user who made the change and rationale for the change.  For example, if a person works unscheduled OT (over-time), the software should track who approved the overtime, who entered the overtime, why the overtime was scheduled (i.e.: to cover call-ins), if the OT was mandatory or voluntary, when it was entered, when it was worked and where it was worked.5.	The application shall manage staff qualifications, certifications and licensures.  For example, reports should be available whenever a user has a certification nearing expiration.  In addition, if two staff plan to work for each other, then the software should verify they are qualified to work for each other.  If they are not, the program should reject the exchange.6.	The application shall provide diagnostic tools such as informational messages, warning screens, error messages, and helpful hints, etc.7.	The application will save and close when encountering a fatal error.8.	The application shall provide for multiple, simultaneous users with a locking mechanism to prevent concurrent update of the same contents/field.  To explain, when using Microsoft Access, it does not seem to handle multiple users well and will lock the program up and/or override what was entered when two people try to edit/enter the same field and record.9.	The software shall be compatible with existing VA hardware/software.10.	The application shall provide the utility to import and export data (to Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, Proclarity, and Vista - specifically employee information to populate the software and pt. Classifications).  An interface with the Human Resources/Payroll application would be highly desirable.  For an import example, it would be preferable that a continuous/daily download occurs that adds new employees and deactivates employees who are no longer employees in the scheduling software.  For an export example, we have a program called Decision Support System that will need to have reports exported to their system from the scheduling software to track the agency workload.11.	The software shall generate email reminders* and notifications per site set up to both employees and supervisors (i.e. time to approve schedule, sign-off on schedule, Self-Scheduling open for Pay Period 10, Self-Scheduling closed for PP10, etc.) * The user will have the ability to chose where the notification is e-mailed - Vista and/or Microsoft Outlook. 12.	The program shall have a mechanism that locks the schedule to further changes after the supervisor has signed off on the schedule by users below a certain access level.13.	The program shall support the creation of unlimited business rules, templates and parameters.14.	  By law, an RN can not work more than 12 hours in a 24 hour period nor 60 hours in a 7 day period.  The program will have the capability to alert the supervisor before an individual exceeds those parameters.  If it is exceeded, then the program will record the approving official's name, date and a justification for each occurrence.15.	The program shall support partial and total self-scheduling, preference-based scheduling, and cyclical scheduling.  To clarify, the employee needs to be able to request and bid for shifts with direct access to the program. 16.	The program shall provide the ability to print the schedules to be signed for time certification.  To clarify, since the program will not interface with PAID (Vista) the time keeper will still need to keep hard copies of the schedule and enter the schedule into Vista.17.	The program shall provide predefined reports and graphs especially for productivity.  Some of the reports are leave usage, agency use, overtime use, sick leave use and workload efficiency and based on the user selected date range.18.	The program shall provide multiple security levels in terms of who can view, create, update, approve, delete, and create reports based on their position/level of access.  For example, the nurse manager will approve the schedule, the evening/night supervisor can override the schedule to offer OT to an employee and the coordinator can override any entry.  In addition, staff end users will be able to view only their records.19.	The program shall provide the ability to store data and documents throughout their life cycle and be able to archive and retrieve information.  For example, one of the requirements of the VA is to save three years worth of data and possibly five years for patient related data.  The program will need to be able to store all aspects of the data for at least that amount of time before it is archived.  After this time period, the program should be able to archive the data for longer storage and then access it if necessary.20.	 The vendor shall present a contingency plan/backup plan for when the server ceases to function or the connection to the server is severed.  A good example of this is the Bar Code Mediation Administration program.  It downloads all the medications for the patient on a local stand-alone at near real time for access when the server is unavailable.21.	The program shall be able to track and trend census data by unit and facility.  One of the things we noted reviewing our last two year trending of census data is that the overall length of stay and bed days of care are going down, but on two of our units it is going up, which has caused us to adjust our staffing.  Without census data available and trending for each unit, we may not have known a shift in resources was needed.22.	 The program shall have the ability to provide simulation of schedules using what-if scenarios and alternative scheduling to better assist the nurse manager in making the most cost effective decisions.23.	The program shall be network (VISN) wide.  Recently it has been proposed to put together a VA traveling nursing corp.  If this done, the software needs to be able to identify vacant FTE that could be filled by one of these pool persons anywhere within the network.24.	The program shall be able to generate budget reports and graphs based on GS (LPNs and NAs) and Title 38 (RNs) pay scales, grade/step and time.  The budget reports and graphs need to include salary costs (including adjustments for benefits), overtime costs, agency/contract costs, float costs (staff being pulled to/from home unit), sitter costs, and unscheduled sick leave costs.25.	The program shall be able to manage overtime offers based on defined criteria (seniority).  For example, the union requires the VA to equitable offer overtime to each employee who is interested.  All uninterested employees need to be identified and left off the OT call list.  From the interested employee list, when the employee was contacted, the result of the contact (no answer, declined, etc.), who contacted, when contacted and OT being offered needs to be recorded.  This information also needs to be able to be printed by employee name and by OT offered with all the contacts before a replacement was found.26.	The vendor shall be able to provide technical support (on-line, telephone or on-call) 24 hours per day/7 days per week.   All bidders will have until close of business (5:00 PM) on July 14, 2009 to provide their demonstrations, at which, time the listing will be closed.  In order to schedule a time to provide a demonstration or to send in a prerecorded demonstration, offerors are asked to contact: Patty Slonaker, Nurse Program Analyst at the Dayton VA Medical Center at 937-268-6511 x3197 or Patty.Slonaker@va.gov.  Offerors will be notified promptly as to whether or not qualification has been attained or not.  If enough responses have been received the solicitation documents will be posted on or about July 20, 2009.  All responsible and pre-qualified offerors will be invited to submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

Belkin is currently the only manufacturere of a TAA Compliant KVM Suite and GITM has therefore been using the Belkin KVM Suite of equipment exclusively. The Belkin KVM Suite of equipment cannot be used without the Interface Adapters. The Belkin KVM Adapters listed above will be used with Belkin KVM Switches that were previously purchased on order 1019-832222 (SAQMMA08F5196). Cisco equipment listed above is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities taht requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches: HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol). APC Smart-UPS Units are IRm ITCCB-approved hardware and have been used to provide power protection for several years. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested byt the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and calssified IT refreshes. IRM/OPS/ITI/GITM identified the Rack Solutions 19-Inch Rack-Mount Shelf as the only suitable item availble in the market today meeting the Department's requirements regarding cost, capacity, performance, packaging, durability and easy of use with the current GITM Netowrk backup Soultion. Furthermore, the equipment listed in paragraph (2) is on the IRM ITCCB approved hardware list. Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department of compatibility with existing hardware and software will place the Deaprtment at risk and will casue unacceptable delays to the Program's scheudle in support of the unclassifed and classified IT refresh efforts. Per FAR 8.405-6 (e) (1), this acquistion is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. As this is a brand name only justifcation, no one contractor's unique qualificatiosn are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Deparment's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system. The equipment listed in paragraph two (2) has undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassifed and classified networks.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for closing agent services for single family properties owned by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in one geographic area, the state of Oklahoma.  HUD intends to award one contract to cover the state of Oklahoma.  The primary objective is to perform closings of HUD-owned properties as quickly as possible, within 50 miles of the subject property.   A purchaser is normally allowed 30-60 calendar days to close a transaction, however, sometimes HUD may offer special incentive programs to homebuyers to close in a shorter period of time, such as 15 days after contract signing.  The contractor is expected to coordinate with the Management and Marketing contractor (M&M) to accomplish the closing within the allotted timeframe unless an extension is necessary due to circumstances outside of the contractors control.   The contract will be performance-based with incentives and disincentives.  The contract duration will be for one year with four one-year options.  This is a total small business set-aside.  More detailed information concerning the work requirements will be provided in the solicitation.  The solicitation is now available for downloading from the Federal Business Opportunity website.  The NAICS Code is 541191 with a size standard of $7 million.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be made available.  Telephone and email requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.  Small business concerns need to respond with a written proposal by the due state stated in the solicitation.  Questions on this solicitation must be received in writing by COB July 16, 2009.  Answers will be provided in the form of an amendment.

<DESC>ONR is soliciting proposals from academia and industry sources capable of
providing to the Navy innovative High Energy Laser (HEL) system and subsystem
technology (hardware and software), tools, concept designs, engineering and technical studies with the potential for involvement in the demonstrations and testing of a prototype Maritime Laser Demonstrator (MLD) for use as counter-material/lethal effects against small boat threats.  The primary purpose of the MLD Technology Incubation and Maturation BAA is to procure these new analytical tools, enable rapid development of significant enhancements, and/or gain additional critical scientific knowledge related to the demonstration and testing of a prototype tens of kilowatt class high-energy laser system in a maritime environment. ONR is interested in receiving white papers and proposals detailing the transition and development of less mature technologies (typically, those seen to be below a Technical Readiness Level or TRL of 6). This Technology Incubation and Maturation Program will not, therefore, fund any activities contained in the existing statements of work for the integration of existing systems into a prototype demonstrator.

<DESC><p>This pre-solicitation synopsis is for Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS) Funds Administration Services requirement. This synopsis is prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2. The Federal Communications Commission (Commission) intends to select a Contractor to assume the roles and responsibilities of the Interstate TRS Fund Administrator (Administrator). The Administrator shall be responsible for all functions associated with administering the Interstate TRS Fund (Fund) including (1) collecting monies from covered interstate common carriers and VoIP providers to create the Fund; (2) developing annual compensation rates, in accordance with Commission guidance, for the various forms of TRS; (3) determining the annual Fund size and carrier contribution factor based on the compensation rates and projected minutes of use for each form of TRS; (4) paying monies from the Fund to eligible TRS providers to compensate them for their reasonable costs of providing TRS; (5) advising the Commission on cost-recovery issues and managing and safeguarding the Fund; and (6) Implementing effective internal controls in accordance with the standards and guidelines established in OMB Circular A-123. The Administrator is responsible for administering and managing the Fund in an efficient, effective manner to ensure that people with disabilities enjoy the benefits of the program as Congress intended. The Contractor shall assume the Administrator functions from the entity currently performing these functions. Title IV of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which added section 225 to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Act), requires the Commission to ensure that TRS is available to persons with hearing and speech disabilities. Specifically, section 225 of the Act instructs the Commission to ensure that TRS is available, &ldquo;to the extent possible and in the most efficient manner,&rdquo; to persons with hearing or speech disabilities in the United States. The statute requires each common carrier offering &ldquo;telephone voice transmission services&rdquo; to offer TRS to persons with hearing and speech disabilities that is &ldquo;functionally equivalent&rdquo; to voice telephone service. TRS is available nationwide, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, so that persons with hearing and speech disabilities can make calls to, and receive calls from, voice telephone users. In some circumstances, TRS equipment also permits persons with hearing disabilities to communicate directly with each other (although such calls are not TRS calls). Initially, only interstate TTY-based TRS (&ldquo;traditional TRS&rdquo;) minutes were reimbursed from the Fund; however, today the Fund reimburses relay service providers for several forms of TRS. These are: (1) interstate traditional TRS; (2) interstate Speech-to-Speech (STS); (3) interstate captioned telephone service (CTS); (4) interstate and intrastate IP Relay; (5) interstate and intrastate Video Relay Service (VRS); and (6) interstate and intrastate Internet Protocol (IP) captioned telephone service (IP CTS). Required services are to cover a one-year base period and four one-year option periods. The Government anticipates the release of Solicitation No. SOL09000002 within 2 to 3 weeks predicated on a full and open competition basis. The Government anticipates a vendor response time of 90 days after release of solicitation. Although it is the Government&rsquo;s intent to release the solicitation electronically via Government Point of Entry (GPE), potential sources interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation must contact Tony Wimbush, Contracts Specialist/Contracting Officer, FCC/Contracts &amp; Purchasing Center, at 202-418-0932 or via email at anthony.wimbush@fcc.gov. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.</p>

<DESC><p>Battelle, Pacific Northwest Division, Management &amp; Operating Contractor of the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), is requesting proposals from prospective offers to provide:</p>
<p>Field Emission High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope <br />A new generation high resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) with a configuration optimized (and customized) to enable microscopy and spectroscopy is being planned as a major new capability for the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL), a national US Department of Energy (DOE) User Facility located at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). This instrument will be designed to allow microscopy and spectroscopy measurements relevant to catalytic and geochemical studies of importance to energy and environmental applications. Because EMSL is a user facility, we are looking for ease of operation, friendly for user training and operation, high instrument durability and excellent instrument service. The system envisioned is a high resolution electron microscope that should be able to provide the following capabilities:</p>
<p>(1) High resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging<br />(2) high spatial resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging<br />(3) High energy resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS)<br />(4) Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy system<br />(5) Image acquisition and recording systems</p>
<p>To answer important questions about the interfacial and defect control of catalytic reactions and the chemical nature of nanoparticles, the microscope shall be equipped with an electron beam with low energy spread and high resolution electron energy loss detector. This will allow detailed chemical information to be obtained with an energy resolution of about 0.3 eV to 0.8 eV or better in electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS). To obtain important information about the role of interface and particle structure on chemical reactivity, the microscope will need to have a point to point resolution better than 1.9 Angstrom (0.19 nm) for TEM imaging and a resolution of better than 1.0 Angstrom (0.1 nm) for STEM bright and dark field imaging. To achieve the STEM resolution, the microscope will need to have an aberration corrector for the STEM probe forming lens (Cs-probe corrector). Gatan image filter (GIF) should be incorporated to energy filtered imaging technique and an energy dispersive x-ray detector system should be incorporated for chemical composition analysis.</p>
<p>The request for proposal is posted at <a href="http://www.pnl.gov/contracts/solicitations/">http://www.pnl.gov/contracts/solicitations/</a>&nbsp; titled RECOVERY ACT: Field Emission and Aberration Corrected Scanning/Transmission Electron Microscope.</p>
<p>If you have questions or need additional information, they must also be submitted in writing to the points of contact.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>UPDATE - 7/6/2009</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this announcement is to update the previous FedBizOpps posting dated June 16, 2009.  The previous notice indicated that the construction documents and the project's Request for Proposal (RFP) would be made available on July 1, 2009.  However at this time these documents are under final review and will be made available as soon as possible.  Once they have received final GSA approval the documents will be released to only those contractors who have met the requirements set forth in the previous notice.  The documents package will contain compact discs containing all the relevant information and documents needed to participate and submit a proposal for the project.  These packages will be sent to the specific list of contractors via FedEx.</p>
<p>Please note the following:<br />1.	GSA cannot award a contract prior to the completion of the environmental review process (the issuance of an EIS with a Record of Decision).  .<br />2.	Project site acquisition is currently ongoing and therefore may affect contractor access to the site prior to award.</p>
<p>A more detailed addition to this notice will be posted at a later date with information regarding evaluation criteria, proposal deadline, schedule etc.  Please continue to check back to receive the most updated information.</p>
<p>If you have any questions please contact the Contracting Officer Shelita Harper, or Contract Specialist Chris Lee.  Contact information is listed at the top of the notice.</p>

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - This modification completes the funding for this effort. The Recovery Act funds are for the ADVENT Program, entitled "Advent Systems Integration Studies" , of which is an R&amp;D effort to conduct demonstrations of multi-design point adaptive turbine engines that automatically adjust fan and core airflow and pressures for optimized performance and fuel efficiency at all flight conditions. This program was awarded as an order under a Basic IDIQ contract. The Basic IDIQ contract was solicited and awarded using competitive procedures which resulted in the award of fourteen (14) IDIQ contracts, all of which were cost-reimbursement type contracts. Cost-type contracts were used because contract performance involved uncertainties that would not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to permit the use of a fixed-price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<AWARDEE>Washington River Protection Solutions, LLC, 720 Park Blvd, BOISE, ID 83729-0001 US
<DESC><p>Modification A015 obligates American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds to the Tank Operations Contract (TOC), contract number DE-AC27-08RV14800. The original scope and purpose of the contract will not change with the addition of the ARRA Stimulus Funds. The Total Contract Price will not increase as a result of this modification.
<p>The TOC Contract is a $7.1B performance-based cost plus award fee contract with specific performance-based incentives awarded to Washington River Protection Solutions, LLC (WRPS) May 29, 2008. The purpose of the contract is to furnish safe, compliant, cost-effective and energy-efficient services to further the Department of Energy, Office of River Protection (ORP) mission to store, retrieve and treat Hanford tank waste, store and dispose of treated waste, and to close the Tank Farm waste management areas to protect the Columbia River.</p>
<p>Modification A015 obligates ARRA funding in the amount of $42.5 million dollars to meet the original contract funding profile and accelerate work that was contemplated in the five-year (5) base period and first option period. The specific period of performance is as follows:</p>
<p>Base Period: October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2013, <br />Option Period 1: October 1, 2013 through September 30, 2016, <br />Option Period 2: October 1, 2016 through September 2018</p>
<p>Modification A015 creates a new contract line item number (CLIN) to segregate the ARRA funded workscope to be accelerated.</p>
<p>CLIN 7 - American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) Workscope<br />- Sub-CLIN 7.1 - ARRA workscope under Sub-CLIN 1.2 - Safe, Compliant Operations. Maintain and operate the Tank Farms, 242-A Evaporator, and supporting Tank Farm infrastructure. Perform all required project support functions (project management, integrated safety management, security and emergency services, interactions, interface management). <br />- Sub-CLIN 7.2 - ARRA workscope under Sub-CLIN 1.3 - Analytical Laboratory Support. Operate and maintain the 222-S Laboratory Complex to support analysis activities performed under a separate DOE-ORP contract.</p>
<p>- Sub-CLIN 7.3 - ARRA workscope under Sub-CLIN 3.1 - Treatment Planning, Waste Feed Delivery, and WTP Transition. Provide integrated system planning for the DOE-ORP mission and perform project planning, system upgrades/replacements, and operations to accomplish waste feed delivery to treatment facilities. Plan for the turnover of completed WTP facilities.</p>
<p>- Sub-CLIN 7.4 - ARRA workscope under Sub-CLIN 3.3 - Immobilized High-Level Waste (IHLW) Storage and Shipping Facility Construction. Modify the Canister Storage Building and/or design, construct, commission, and operate a separate interim storage facility for IHLW canisters from WTP and a shipping facility to prepare IHLW and spent nuclear fuel (SNF) canisters for shipment to a permanent repository.</p>
<p>Rationale for using other than a fixed price and/or competitive award:</p>
<p>Contract Clause I.103, FAR 52.243-2 Changes - Cost Reimbursement (AUG 1987), ALT II (APR 1984), ALT III (APR 1984), ALT IV (APR 1984) of the contract authorizes the Contracting Officer to make changes within the general scope of the contract.</p>
<p>The work scope considered for acceleration as a result of the receipt of the ARRA funds is clearly within the scope of the contract and specifically identified in Sub-CLIN 1.2, Safe, and Compliant Operations, Sub-CLIN 1.3, Analytical Laboratory Support, and Sub-CLIN 3.1, Treatment Planning, Waste Feed Delivery, and WTP Transition. Offerors were provided ample opportunity to propose to this specific scope of work during the initial TOC competition. Not only was this work specifically identified in the TOC SOW, but also in the WBS Dictionary sheets and within Section J, Attachment J. 11 Supplemental Work Description Tables provided to Offerors during the TOC solicitation. Offerors were further put on notice via Section B.14, DOE Authorization of Work, that the ORP reserved the right to "turn work on/off" as funding was made available through the contract period of performance.</p>
<p>The prospects for performing the TOC scope of work under a firm fixed-price (FFP) contract were evaluated prior to the recent TOC competition. The work contemplated is highly complex and many variables exist that do not lend themselves to being FFP. This, coupled with the fact that the work scope has already been defined, competed, and awarded under the TOC, a Cost Plus contract with Performance-Based Incentives, FFP efforts at the prime level are not possible. ORP has communicated to the TOC contractor that FFP subcontracts shall be utilized to the maximum extent possible in accomplishing the specific tasks executed with ARRA funds.</p>

<AWARDEE>Nowood Fencing, 114 Road 49, Ten Sleep, WY 82442 US
<DESC>Scope of Contract
The work shall consist of what is shown on the drawings, stated in the specifications and
summarized below:
1.Dick Creek Fences: This work shall consist of furnishing and installing three strand,
smooth wire, high-tension electric fence, braces, gates and one cattle guard. Fence
construction is divided into three separate sections of approximately; 8,826 ft, 7,900
ft. and 6,300 ft. Also to include the removal and relocation of one cattle guard.
2. Carter Mountain Fences: The exclosure is a 3 strand barbed wire fence with a top
rail. Posts and top rail are treated, >8 in diameter and are generally sound enough to
be reused for this project. Any materials that need to be replaced will be provided by
the contractor.
The work to be done involves reconstructing in place the west half of the north fence
line (see attached map). This part of the exclosure was built in a wet area and has
gradually sunk into the ground. It cannot be moved as it was constructed on the Forest
Service property boundary, and moving it to dry ground would place it on private
land. Posts will be installed at ground level to prevent the fence from sinking in the
future.
The second aspect of the project is removing most of the northeast and east sides of
the exclosure and reconstructing it on the west side of the road (see attached map).
The first gate (in the northeast corner of the exclosure) will be removed. The second
gate (in the southeast corner of the exclosure) will be retained along with enough
fencing to tie into natural barriers preventing motorized vehicles from driving around
the gate. This will be marked on the ground prior to initiation of contract work.
Continuous Fence: Approximately 500 of continuous fencing will be installed at the
end of Forest Road 474.1V to prevent motorized vehicles from going beyond the
roads end (see attached map). Continuous fencing panels, wood posts, and hardware
will be provided by the government and will be delivered on site. All other materials
will be supplied by the contractor.
3. Brown Mountain Campground (Alternate Bid Item): This work shall include the
removal and disposal of 490 feet of wood fence and the installation of 490 feet of two
rail steel pipe fence and posts.

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<BR><BR>Using Recovery Act funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a task order to contract number W91278-07-D-0111, Task Order 0022,  a competitively awarded Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract for Cultural Resources Services for the Mobile District, awarded to Brockington and Associates, 6611 Bay Circle Suite 220, Norcross, Georgia 30071-1225.  This task order will be for Cultural Resources Investigations for Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa (ACT) River Basis, Water Control Manual and EIS, Alabama and Georgia.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the task order will be to comply with appropriate cultural resources laws and regulations, and the management and protection of historic properties within the basin.<BR> <BR>The objective of the cultural resources investigations is to comply with statutory laws and regulations that govern Federal responsibilities concerning management and protection of historic properties.  Current work associated with completion of Water Control Manual and EIS for the ACT is to present data that will complete a study of cultural resources of the river basin that includes an inventory of sites along the waterway; a review of regional histories, archeological surveys, and historic properties management plans (HPMPs); and GIS data and update of predictive model on effects of water allocation as satisfaction of regulatory requirements including but not limited to those in the National Historic Preservation Act and 36CFR800 (Protection of Historic Properties).  The results of this study will be incorporated into the EIS and Water Control Manual and will be used to evaluate the potential impacts and effects to cultural resources in the ACT basin.  In the past the evaluations of impacts have focused on three potential effects from changes in water level management: erosion, deposition of sediment, and access.  The studies resulting from this contract will be coordinated with the appropriate SHPO, Tribal representatives and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation by the Government.<BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The  work to be performed is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions.  2) The incumbent contractor has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost.  3)  They have provided a predictive model for archaeological site information for the original water allocation study within the basin based on the contractors familiarity with the project.  4) This contract enables the work to begin immediately.<BR><BR>The American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and  to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current IDIQ contract to meet its requirements.   This contract was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  <BR>

<DESC><p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />Electrical Upgrades - Missile Launch Facilities<br />FA4528-09-C-3011
<p><br />1. AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:<br />United States Air Force<br />5 CONS/LGCA<br />211 Missile Ave.<br />Minot AFB, ND 58705</p>
<p>2. DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:<br />This is a justification and approval for using a sole source selection under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."</p>
<p>3. DESCRIPTION OF THE REQUIREMENT:<br />The requirement is to upgrade the power equipment that supplies electricity to 28 Launch Facilities in the McLean Cooperative area.<br /><br />4. STATUTORY AUTHORITY:<br />The statutory authority is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as identified in FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>5. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED:<br />a. 28 sites are currently supplied power by McLean Electric Cooperative using 40 year old equipment and technology. The current system meets industry stands, but does not meet the government's need for "cleaner power" to support missile site technology upgrades. The Cooperative is the owner of the electrical equipment being replaced, and will continue to own and maintain the new infrastructure as well. The Cooperative limits maintenance and repair of its distribution system to its own workforce, therefore, restricting the government's ability to compete the requirement.<br />b. As a result of the current system not meeting the government's need for "cleaner power", additional time, maintenance, and equipment costs are expended to dispatch crews to investigate and repair possible problems. Upgrading this electrical equipment will result in reduced operational/maintenance expenses to the government.</p>
<p>6. EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE OFFERS FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE:<br />This acquisition is limited to the single Cooperative that supplies power to the Missile Launch Facility. No action was taken to publish this requirement as the acquisition falls under the exception at FAR 5.202(a)(5)..."The proposed contract action is for utility services other than telecommunications services and only one source is available."<br />7. DETERMINATION THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE:<br />The significant items on the independent government estimate were compared to the amount charged by local electrical supply companies. It is determined that fair and reasonable pricing in line with general local market pricing, can be expected to be obtained on the requirement.</p>
<p>8. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED:<br />Market research was conducted to determine if other than the Cooperative could provide this service. It was determined that the owner of the utility would not allow construction on their distribution system without contracting through them due to regulatory and liability issues.</p>
<p>9. OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:<br />The electrical Cooperative providing power to these remote sites owns the distribution line/system and hence limits the government's ability to compete said requirement.</p>
<p>10. LISTING OF SOURCES THAT EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN THE ACQUITITION:<br />There were no other sources that expressed interest in fulfilling the requirements of this acquisition.</p>
<p>11. ACTIONS TO REMOVE ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIS OR SERVICES REQUIRED:<br />Based on the cooperative's ownership of the distribution system, there is no way to get around this requirement for sole source acquisition to the respective servicing electrical cooperative.</p>
<p>12. CONTRACING OFFICER CERFIFICATION:<br />I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief, the facts and representations under my cognizance; which are included in this justification, are accurate and comp</p>

Military Trail, West Palm Beach, FL 33410 has the need for continuity of Home Oxygen Services in accordance with Health Care Resources Contracting-Buying Title 38 U.S.C. as outlined in VA Directives 1663. VA Medical Center in West Palm Beach intends to make a sole source interim contract award to Dura Medical Equipment, Inc., a small business, for the purchase of Oxygen Services for the months of July 1, 2009 through September 30 2009, with one option of three (3) months extension, if needed. Dura Medical Equipment, Inc. has proven to be capable of providing these services with outstanding performance ratings. In order to maintain uninterrupted patient care this has prompted contracting to expedite an order under FAR Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source can provide these temporary services until a new contract can be establish.  At this time, Miami is working on a new consolidated contract, which includes WPB and Miami VA only. Based in past performance, and in order to maintain uninterrupted patient care is recommended to have Dura Medical Equipment, Inc, as a temporary solution until a permanent contract can be awarded by the Miami VAMC. This notice of intend is for information purposes only. No solicitation will be made available and all information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government by July 10, 2009. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No solicitation is available at this time. ***No response to this special notice is necessary*** Questions must be submitted to Yamil O. Rodriguez, Contracting Specialist via e-mail at yamil.rodriguez@va.govJustification for other than full and open competitionWest Palm Beach VA Medical Center Contracts TeamSole Source Justification Home Oxygen Services(1)	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value and proposed contractor)VA Medical Center in West Palm Beach has a need for continuity of Complete home Oxygen service to VA patients in the home setting. The identified vendor will deliver to VA patient's residence the necessary and  identified equipment. Vendor will set-up and educate the patients on the equipment as well as perform a safety evaluation on the equipment and the home. Vendor will provide the VA with all required documentation as required by Joint Commission as well as the Prosthetics Service. Vendor will also be responsible for all education, plan of care as well as providing the patient with right and responsibilities. All of this must be documented at the Vendors  establishment in a 6 part folder and be secured. Refills and additional equipment will also be provided as needed. The estimated value is $90,000.00 for three months(2)	Identify the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. (Check ONE only)X  FAR 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements (Use the space in #3 to list vendor's unique capabilities)	 FAR 6.302-2 -- Unusual and Compelling Urgency (Use the space in #3 to describe the harm to theGovernment that will occur if award is delayed.)	 List other FAR Part 6 Exception to Competition	(3)	List proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition that supports the use of the authority cited above (Proprietary rights, unique attributes or capabilities, harm to the Gov if award is delayed etc)The company identified is located with 10 minutes of the VA and already has established inventory of VA owned equipment in place. They are the only oxygen company that will be able to meet all technical aspects and competencies necessary in order to fulfill VA's requirements to service all home oxygen patients' needs and requirements for both routine and emergent orders. (4)	Describe actions taken (if any) to remove or overcome any barriers to competition and to increase the possibility of competitive contracts for this effort in the future:A sole source vendor is being sought at this time as there is only one company that can meet the necessary medical and technical requirements. This is a temporary solution until the new contract solicitation is issued and awarded. (5)	Description of the market research conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.In Accordance with FAR 10.01, the market survey confirmed the requirements are usual and customary in a  commercial marketplace and there are no unusual VA requirements that would exclude the procurement as a  commercial service. The home oxygen services provided by the current company, Dura Medical Equipment, Inc.  were under a VISN Consolidated contract issued by Miami VA Medical Center. The contract expired on February 22 2009. At this time Miami is working on a new consolidated contract which includes WPB and Miami VA only(6)	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition (Attach Continuation Sheets if more space is needed):Based in past performance, and in order to maintain uninterrupted patient care this has prompted contracting to  expedite a purchase order under the FAR 6.101 (a) and FAR 6.303.1. This is a temporary solution until the new contract solicitation is issued and awarded. I certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.Technical personnelContracting Officer
