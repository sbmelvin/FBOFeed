<DESC>NA The purpose of this amendment is to hereby incorporate the material submittal requirements as attachment 01 to the description of services and provide the government reponses to industry's questions. (Note the material submittal requirements shall be submitted to the government for approval prior to work commencement)  They are not required with each vendor's offeror. Attachment 01  Material Submittals 1.  Antenna Siting Survey for Bldg. 3029 2.  Contractor Progress Schedule (Biweekly increments)  Biweekly reports shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer during the course of work.  The are due on the Monday following the week of the report. 3.  Transmission Line/Conductor/Connector Materials Specification 4.  Structural Materials Specification 5.  Antenna Mounting Specification 6.  Proposed and Modified Structure Drawings 7.  Proposed and Modified Cable Path Drawings 8.  Raceway/Conduit/Junction Box Materials Specifications 9.  Paint Samples 10. Sealant/Fireblock Samples 11. Antenna Matrix Layout and Materials Specifications 12. Antenna Substitution (LMR-UHF) Specifications 13. Company Certifications 14. Test Results of all Transmission Line/Antenna Systems Question:  Could you clarify who is supplying the three UHF/VHF umbrella antennas?  Section 3.0-A-1-a of the specifications says to install three UVU-200 umbrella antennas but is not clear who is supplying them. Answer:  The government shall provide the antennas. Question:  The RFP states zero penetrations allowed in the roof for the coax runs.  Does this also apply to the OSHA fall protection railing that will need to be installed around the perimeter of the parachute loft roof? Answer:  There shall be no roof penetrations due to the fact any penetration of the roof will void the Government's warranty. Question:  Is the marquee sign display antenna being provided, or will we need to provide it? Answer:  The government shall provide the marquee sign. Question:  Are there any structural drawings available for the parachute loft? Answer:  Any vendors interested in obtaining structural drawings of the parachute loft for preparation of proposal purposes may obtain a copy be emailing Chief Master Sergeant Linda Head at linda.head@dcandr.ang.af.mil or by calling her at (240) 857-4958. Question:  Matrix Patch Panel.  We are unfamiliar with this term.  (We are aware of coax cable entry ports/panels, but have not heard of Matrix Patch Panel.)  Is there a specific part number or brand that is preferred? Answer:  An Antenna/Coax Matrix Panel is a Demarc Panel where all transmission lines are terminated near the equipment.  There is dozens of web sites that address this issue.  We have not identified a specific brand or model number as that is a contractor submittal requirement.  Short jumpers are then made from the panel to the equipment. Question:  What are the current antenna model numbers, frequencies, output powers and antenna patterns for the existing antennas? Answer:  All antennas are Omni-direction radiation patterns, with the exception of the Marquee antenna (yaggi type); the main lobe pattern of the yaggi is aimed at the Alert Aircraft Shelters.  EMITTER TYPE                       FREQ BAND/POWER                          ANTENNA URC-200-PRM-500                    115-399 MHZ@50 WATTS MAX             UVU-200 OMNI AN/PRC-117 TAC                     115-399 MHZ@20 WATTS MAX         TACO D-2118 OMNI ASTRO SPECTRA CONSOLETE LMR        406-420 MHZ@40 WATTS           FOLDED DIPOLE OMNI ALERT MARQUEE                      135-160 MHZ@10 WATTS                  YAGGI LOBED GIANT VOICE MOTOROLA SPECTRA       135-170@40 WATTS                         OMNI LMR THE PROPOSAL DUE DATE IS CLOSE OF BUSINESS JULY 30, 2003.
