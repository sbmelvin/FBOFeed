Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.
Qualification Requirements:  Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.  
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to Patrick McGowan at (405) 734-8120; fax (405) 734-8129, or e-mail patrick.mcgowan@tinker.af.mil

<DESC>Notice of Contracting Action (NOCA) Pre-Solicitation Number: 15-048
<p>MARK IV-B SUPPORT<br />The United States Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Remote Sensing Systems Directorate (RS) intends to negotiate and award a sole source modification to existing Lockheed Martin Information Corporation Integrated Services and Global Solutions contract # FA88223-07-C-0001 to accomplish the following projects on the MARK IVB Weapon System:<br /><br />o Antenna refurbishment projects at Andersen AFB and Lajes AB <br />o Maintain/improve the MARK IV-B Forecaster/Viewer software as requested and approved by AFWA. These projects could include necessary changes to software, hardware or firmware to allow the MARK IV-B Forecaster/Viewer to function efficiently with newly added satellites.<br />o Maintain, update and upgrade ingest and data servers specifically Ingest and Storage Modification, Phase A and Phase B<br />o Update the software, hardware and firmware baselines to maintain the capability to ingest state-of-the-art weather sensor satellite data formats as required by Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) on a continuous basis, this could include but is not limited to the following satellites that are currently active in space and those that may be launched during the term of this contract: COSMIC series, JPSS series, entire existing and future GOES series of satellites, all Meteosat series, INSAT series, Kalpana -1, Electro Series, Feng Yung Series, COMS series, Himawari Series (all channels), MTG series, GEO-KOMPSAT series, all DMSP series, Meteor series, Metop series, SUOMI NPP, all NOAA satellites, Artica series, all NASA satellites, and any other satellites and satellites systems as directed by AFWA.<br />o Add, remove (including decommissioning) or update MARK IV-B sites and mission essential equipment, as required by AFWA; including but not limited to adding sites in Antarctica, Asia, Europe, Africa, North America, South America, Australia and the North Pole. Sites that potentially may be required to be removed include existing MARK IV-B sites in Guam, Alaska, Hawaii, Kadena (Japan), Lajes (Azores), Kapaun (Germany), Soto Cano (Honduras), and Ali-Al-Salem (Kuwait).<br />o Update sites to meet or maintain Air Force guidance regarding information assurance requirements including moving server routing to the "de-militarized zone" (DMZ) at each site that currently exists; Guam, Alaska, Hawaii, Kadena (Japan), Lajes (Azores), Kapaun (Germany), Soto Cano (Honduras), and Ali-Al-Salem (Kuwait), and ensure that any new sites installed at any new location meet Air Force Guidance regarding information assurance requirements.</p>
<p>This effort requires the use of a government qualified test bed. Currently, Lockheed Martin is the only contractor with test bed capability which provides for the immediate testing of data n direct alignment with the MARK IVB Weapon system. The period of performance will be for a period of approximately 19 months.</p>
<p>Each project discussed above will affect a specific contractor task currently on contract. The projects associated with this Notice of Contract Action allow the above activities to be maintained, enhanced, created or removed, dependent upon the actions required by the project at hand, and will be integrated into the task as defined in the contract. The Antenna refurbishment projects will provide additional X band performance at both bases. As new satellites are added to the mission, the Forecaster Viewer software must be updated to accept the specific, and distinct parameters of each satellite.

The requirements are based on mission, emergencies, weather conditions, and other factors related to running an Army installation.

Because of this, the Government is under no obligation to maintain a bidders' mailing list.  It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access FedBizOpps to obtain the solicitation and any amendments, which may be issued. Failure to obtain any said amendments and respond to them by date and time set for receipt of quotes may render your quote nonresponsive and result in the rejection of the same. <br> Please direct all questions or inquiries to Mr. Jorge Chavez-Rey at jorge.r.chavezrey.civ@mail.mil.

<DESC><strong>The purpose of this notice is to publicize the government's intent to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of subpart 6.302-2.&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blackberry Enterprise Server (BES) Support Services:</span></strong><br />The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is seeking to contract with HP Enterprise Service (HPES) to provide support and service for its Blackberry Enterprise Server (BES), Blackberry support and subscription services. HPES currently provides these services under task order TCC09HQD0033-150009, which will expire on May 31, 2015. To ensure uninterrupted service and support for the OCC's Blackberry service, the OCC is seeking a sole-source bridge contract with HPES through September 30, 2015, with a one-year option for continued support. The Blackberry devices are the OCC's current mobile delivery device for its email system. As email is considered a mission critical application, having this Blackberry service and devices are critical to keeping our large cadre of mobile examiners informed and connected. The OCC is currently conducting a pilot for a new mobile device management system. The results of the pilot will not be ready until after the period of performance for the current HP Blackberry task ends May 31, 2015 due to unanticipated program challenges regarding the pilot. The results of the pilot will assist the OCC in determining if the OCC takes a new approach to its mobile device delivery system for email, or if it continues with the Blackberry solution. This decision point will influence whether or not OCC exercises the option period. The bridge contract should afford adequate time for the OCC to conduct its assessment. It is for these reasons that the OCC requires a bridge contract with HPES for Blackberry services. To not take such action, will seriously injure the government.
<p><strong><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Email Services:</span><br /></strong>The OCC seeks to also continue email system support from HPES as part of this bridge contract action. HPES currently provides these services under task order TCC09HQD0033-150008; which will expire on September 30, 2015. The OCC's Microsoft Exchange 2010 full support ended on January 31, 2015. Microsoft continues to provide technical support and security updates, however, since the "mainstream" support has ended, it means there will be no new features, enhancements, non-security updates or Service Packs provided until the OCC upgrades to Microsoft Exchange 2013, which will be fully supported by Microsoft. The OCC intends to first perform an upgrade of its Active Directory (AD system) in the 3rd and 4th quarters of FY &lsquo;15, and to then migrate to Microsoft Exchange 2013 in FY &lsquo;16. These major upgrades require extensive planning and coordination amongst many Information Technology Solutions (ITS) divisions as well as business units. The risk would be too great to try to perform these upgrades while in the process of transitioning to a new email solution contract, which would include a massive data migration effort. It is necessary that ITS upgrade Active Directory and Exchange to ensure its email solution is technically stable and able to receive full support from Microsoft prior to conducting a competitive procurement and&nbsp;transitioning to a potential new email solution. The OCC's mission critical email application must be at current, fully supported Microsoft Exchange version in order to receive all necessary patches, upgrades and enhancements to ensure continued operational excellence for the email application. To not take such action, will seriously injure the government.</p>
<p>The bridge contract period of performance for Email services will be from 10/01/2015 to 06/31/2016, with an optional period from 07/01/2016 through 09/30/2016.</p>

<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for the continuation of Contract NNG05EC87C with the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) for flight operations and science analyses of the Lyman-Alpha Mapping Photometer (LAMP) instrument, which is a state-of-the-art, one-of-a-kind instrument, aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft.  SwRI is currently performing both the instrument operations, which includes spacecraft operations planning, scheduling, and engineering parameter review and trending, as well as the science operations which includes initiating all commands to the instrument, planning all instrument modes and turn-ons, and data dissemination to the co-investigators and to the general scientific community through the Planetary Data System (PDS). <p> NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to SwRI.  The estimated period of performance of this cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract extension will be for 2-years from March 16, 2015 through March 15, 2017. <p> SwRI is the only organization currently qualified to perform the subject requirement for the following reasons:	1) Only SwRI possesses the high level scientific expertise, the detailed design, test and operation knowledge of the LAMP instrument and LRO spacecraft, and the capability to integrate the science operations and science data analysis including targeting;  2) SwRI scientists and engineers are unique in their familiarity with the LAMP instrument design, testing and calibration as well as the LRO spacecraft since the organization designed, fabricated, calibrated, tested, and integrated the LAMP instrument for the LRO spacecraft, including at the spacecraft level after delivery to LRO; 3) SwRI has developed unique software for: testing the instrument on-orbit, generating calibration target selection, checking telemetry received for health and safety of the  LAMP instrument, processing the raw scientific data in order for scientist to be able to manipulate, display, and analyze it and producing summary data. Since no other organization was involved with these activities on an in-depth level, no other organization currently has the knowledge and experience to perform the requirement. <p> Statutory authority for this procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.  However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 31, 2015.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. <p> The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.

These are largely observable concrete factors that capture a fraction of the variability in these groups. The proposed project will evaluate individuals on abstract, indirect, psychological constructs and psychosocial factors (e.g., risk propensity, invincibility, organizational culture) and use this information along with the well-documented observable factors to develop profiles of belt users.</p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white">While much progress has been made in raising belt use, targeting the remaining non-users has posed a challenge. Further understanding these individuals, specifically their attitudes, risk perceptions, and other psychological factors, may prove beneficial for program development and subsequently effective for promoting behavior change. Insight into the psychological make-up and psychosocial patterns of behavior of rare and situational belt users will provide a basis for developing new programs directed at these individuals. The objective of the project is to determine psychological constructs and psychosocial factors related to belt users and create profiles of user types based on these constructs and demographic factors. The results will yield a more comprehensive picture of belt user groups which will be transitioned to program development.</p>

<p>Due to the increasing number of law enforcement agencies that are mobilizing to enforce State legislation restricting hand-held phone use and texting among drivers, and the apparent challenges faced by States to enforce such laws, providing a comprehensive picture of the laws across the States, including the challenges faced by enforcement and the strategies used to overcome those challenges, will help produce feasible enforcement actions, and stimulate the issuance of citations for drivers who engage in these dangerous behaviors.</p>

<DESC>In the 5-year initial phase of the CBC Screening Libraries Center (CBCSLC) a ~130,000 small molecule chemical screening library was established. The library has been one resource used to support 1) NExT project HTS campaigns and 2) extramural and NIH intramural investigator HTS projects. The on-going Project will be specifically responsible for continuation of this resource and include the storage, production, QC analysis and distribution of the current library 130,000 compounds collection as diversity, focused and cherry-picked sets. The collection includes solid stores, working solution stores and plated sets. The CBCSLC will also be responsible for maintaining a secure, electronic database of all associated chemical, inventory, and distribution related information and interfacing, as necessary, with other DCTD infrastructure components. The CBCSLC should have the capability to support expansion of the library, employing state-of-the art expertise in library design and analysis. It should also have capability and extensive experience in procurement of selected solid chemical samples, including a thorough knowledge of the commercial vendor universe.

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from the incumbent, Science Application International Corporation (SAIC), at 1710 SAIC Drive, McLean, VA 22102 for 232,024 hours of support services. This is necessary for the continuance of contractor support services to the Integrated Communications and Information Systems (ICIS) Division in the areas of Contract Management Support, Technical Support, Systems Engineering Support, Project Management Support, Organizational Management Support, Administrative Support and Hardware Acquisition Support. The proposed bridge contract is needed for continuing ongoing support currently being done under existing SAIC task order, N00178-04-D-4119-M807, while the follow-on contract is being competed with an estimated award date in March 2017. This requirement will be a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) bridge contract. Due to the ongoing nature of the support services currently being performed under task order N00178-04-D-4119-M807and the need to continue these services without a break in work, SAIC is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a competitive follow-on contract. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, interested parties may submit informational inquiries related to this requirement. The Government will consider all information received before 31 March 2015 1530 EST. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. Any questions shall be submitted to Kevin Ritter, Code 2.5.1.3.12, via email: kevin.ritter@navy.mil.
<p>Per FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." SAIC is the sole source capable of providing these efforts without creating the impact on the sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in service. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government would incur and not recover through competition, this will be procured on a sole source basis.</p>

<SUBJECT>Advanced Development of More Effective/Universal Influenza Vaccines
<SOLNBR>BARDA_Universal_Influenza_Synopsis
<CONTACT>Matthew A. McCord, Contracting Officer, Email matthew.mccord@hhs.gov - Kevin Nilles, Contracting Officer, Email kevin.nilles@hhs.gov
<DESC>Prevention of disease caused by seasonal and novel influenza strains of pandemic potential continues to be a public health challenge. Vaccination is the primary medical intervention for prevention of infection with these viruses. Seasonal influenza vaccines, which are produced and administered annually, are only 30% to 70% effective. Excess morbidity and mortality caused by seasonal influenza virus disease can be devastating in terms of years of life lost and economic productivity. The emergence of novel strains of influenza viruses presents a public health threat, with potential rapid global spread among people with no pre-existing immunity to the virus, causing catastrophic morbidity and mortality.
<p><br />The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), is launching a new initiative supporting the advanced development of influenza vaccine candidates with the goal to provide enhanced, long-lasting protection from a broad range of antigenically divergent influenza viruses within and across subtypes. These new vaccines will be more effective than current vaccines in providing protection from influenza infection in people of all ages and in people generally considered high-risk for severe disease associated with influenza infection. Additionally, these new vaccines may serve as a priming dose during non-pandemic periods to enable a single dose of a pandemic influenza vaccine to be effective. As such, promising experimental data providing evidence that the new vaccine may serve as a primer for a pandemic influenza vaccine booster will be evaluated favorably. Offerors are required to develop these vaccine candidates towards final FDA licensure for prophylaxis against disease caused by seasonal and pandemic influenza.</p>
<p><br />HHS/ASPR Acquisition Management, Contracts and Grants (AMCG) intends to publish a Request for Proposal (RFP) to support the advanced development of new influenza vaccines that are more effective than currently licensed vaccines as a step towards development of a universal influenza vaccine with potential prime- boost vaccine properties for pandemic influenza. This RFP will provide additional details regarding the desired characteristics for the development towards a universal influenza vaccine candidate through a defined target product profile (TPP). BARDA contemplates a single or multiple contract award(s) to develop, manufacture, and evaluate more effective influenza vaccine candidate(s) toward US licensure. Offeror(s) shall demonstrate their ability to meet the following mandatory criteria:</p>
<p><br />&bull; Evidence of greater cross-reactive immune responses elicited by the proposed influenza vaccine candidates compared to U.S.-licensed seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines from proof-of-concept in-vitro and relevant animal studies,</p>
<p><br />&bull; Evidence of progress towards advanced development of proposed influenza vaccine candidates from Phase 1 dose-ranging clinical studies that demonstrates the vaccine candidate is well tolerated and able to induce cross-reactive immune responses to a range of antigenically divergent influenza viruses,</p>
<p><br />&bull; Evidence of commitment for U.S. licensure of vaccine product from documentation of an investigational new drug (IND) submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, AND</p>
<p><br />&bull; Evidence of domestic manufacturing capability, either alone or in partnership with other manufacturers, or plans for technology transfer to a domestic production site.</p>

The A/E must demonstrate its qualifications with respect to the published evaluation criteria for all services. Evaluation Criteria (1) through (4) are considered most important and equal among themselves; Criteria (5) and (6) are of slightly less importance than (1) through (4), but are equal value among themselves; Criteria (7) and (8) are the least important and listed in descending order of importance. Specific evaluation criteria include:
 
	1. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, 	including, 	where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and 	the use of recovered materials.
	2.  Professional Qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.
	3.  Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time.
	4.  Past Performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost 	control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.
	5.  Specific experience and qualifications of personnel proposed for assignment to the project and 	their record of working together as a team.
	6.  Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality 	of the 	project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of 	qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project.
	7.  Reputation and standing of the firm and its principal officials with respect to professional 	performance, general management, and cooperativeness.
	8.  Record of significant claims against the firm because of improper or incomplete 	architectural and engineering services.

Likewise, if the offeror/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the offeror/team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

NOTE: If the Offeror is a joint venture, information should be submitted as a joint venture; however, if there is no information for the joint venture, information should be submitted for either joint venture partner, not to exceed a total of five (5) projects for this criterion. Projects shall be submitted on the SF330.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.

Submission requirements: Describe the firm's ability to concurrently perform and manage multiple projects in different locations to meet aggressive schedules, multiple disciplines, and control costs and the firm's capacity to accomplish multiple projects simultaneously. 

Criterion 4 - Past Performance - Offerors will be evaluated on past performance with Government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, compliance with schedules, cost control, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction.

<p>1. Draft Performance Work Statement</p>
<p>All interested firms shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to provide these services to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Proposal) exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code assigned to this acquisition is 712110 (Museums) with a size standard of $27.5 Million. Firms responding should indicate their size in relation to this size standard, and indicate socio-economic status (SB, 8(a), SDVO, or HUBZone). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. The government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. No set-aside decision has been made. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice.

<p>CAPABILITIES PACKAGE: All interested firms shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly demonstrates their capability to provide the required service. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements.

Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming provided. Interested firms may submit resumes of key personnel.

<DESC>Synopsis:  <br> THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE REQUESTING SPECIFIC AND INNOVATIVE RISK MITIGATION SOLUTIONS FOR AN INTERIM CONTRACT REQUIREMENT AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. IT IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY SERVICES, NOR IS IT THE INTENT OF THE MISSION & INSTALLATION CONTRACTING COMMAND (MICC), FORT BENNING, GEORGIA TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOUGHT.  <br>  <br> 1. INFORMATION: MICC, Fort Benning is seeking preliminary marketing information, from capable and reliable sources who can provide specific innovative solutions that mitigate the inherit risk associated with a short effort.  An interim contract is necessary to minimize lapse in services for awarding a contract for non-personnel services to provide Base Operation services for the Directorate of Public Works (DPW), Installation Management Command (IMCOM) located at Fort Benning, Georgia.  Respondents must address the ability to perform accelerated short notice requirements which include Buildings and Structure Maintenance, Utility and HVAC Services, Range Maintenance, Cemetery Operations and Remote Camp Operations at Fort Benning. The follow-on acquisition is proceeding slower than expected, however, the continuation of Base Operations Support Services (BASOPS) are vital to the operation and maintenance of the installation during this transition. Delays necessitate an interim coverage for a short period of time between lapse of contract and final award and transition to the new contract. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) classified for this effort is 561210, Facilities Support Services, with a current business size of $38.5M.  <br>  <br> 2. PROJECT SCOPE: This possible future requirement will be supporting maintenance and support services for the soldiers and personnel located on the Fort Benning military installation.  <br>  <br> BROAD DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  Services include the following, which are considered mission-critical:  <br>  <br>  	Buildings and Structures Maintenance:  provides all maintenance and repair functions for buildings and structures at Fort Benning.  This includes maintenance and repair of building electrical, plumbing, roofing, locks, windows, doors, emergency exits, and fire alarm systems. It also includes maintenance and repair of street signs, traffic lights, warning sirens, dining facility equipment, etc., as well as inspection/repairs of daycare facilities. <br>  <br>  	Utility and HVAC Services:  provides for all heating and cooling services at Fort Benning.   This also includes inspections and repairs of backflow preventers to ensure safe drinking water and emergency generators to ensure continuous power to computing and vital safety systems.   It also includes operation of propane peak shaving plant, which is essential to provide heating during periods of restricted supply of natural gas from Liberty Utilities. <br>  <br>  	Range Maintenance:  provides for maintenance and repair of all ranges at Fort Benning, to include berms, range shacks/towers, target systems, etc.   If not done, these ranges would quickly become unusable for training.  Fort Benning fires more rounds than all other bases in the Army combined. <br>  <br>  	Cemetery Operations:  provides for operation and maintenance of the Fort Benning cemetery.  This cemetery is active for internments and is a national shrine to our veterans.    <br>  <br>  	Remote Camp Operations:  All public works functions (including heating, cooling, electrical/plumbing/roofing maintenance, and operation of the water/waste water treatment plants) at Camp Merrill.  This camp is vital to the mountaineering portion of the U. S. Army Ranger School training. <br>  <br>  <br> 3. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: All interested firms shall submit their innovative solutions, and specific unique capabilities that exist that will facilitate success to Terrhonda C. Mills, Contract Specialist. The Army requires a general statement of capability.  Submission shall be received by 1400 hours or 2:00 p.m., 27 March 2015 and shall not exceed two (2), 8-1/2 x 11 pages. THIS SYNOPSIS IS ONLY FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES. This RFI does not constitute a request for proposal nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of response to this notice. All data received in response to this RFI marked or designated as corporate or proprietary will be fully protected from release outside the U.S. Government. If the recipients believe that the Army is unreasonably restricting competition, please contact the MICC's Legal Advisor/Contracts Attorney, Richard P. Parker at Richard.p.parker10.civ@mail.mil. Concerns must address the title of this requirement, reference this synopsis, and specifically why the respondent believes the Army is unreasonably restricting competition. Concerns identifying unique innovations may be addressed via e-mail to Terrhonda C. Mills at terrhonda.c.mills.civ@mail.mil. Any submission that identifies potential risk mitigation will be considered; however, the Government will determine its validity and implementation. <br>  <br>

<a href="mailto:hunter.davenport@us.army.mil">MICC Center - Fort Sam Houston (JBSA)</a>
<DESC>SYNOPSIS:  <br>  <br> On behalf of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM), Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Division,  the Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center - Fort Sam Houston, Texas, is conducting a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS) pursuant to FAR Part 10-Market Research.  Interested sources should respond to the questions presented within this announcement.   This notice shall NOT be considered a request for proposal, quotation, or an invitation for bid.  Response to this SSS does not guarantee or exclude your participation in the forthcoming acquisition process.  Any information provided by the Government under this notice is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to release of the solicitation. The Government will NOT award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it be liable for any costs associated with preparing and submitting a response to this notice. All submissions will become Government property and will not be returned.   <br>  <br> BACKGROUND:  <br>  <br> The U.S. Army requires information to determine the availability of resources to provide Caretaker Support Services at the Stratford Army Engine Plant (SAEP) in Stratford, Connecticut. SAEP was recommended for closure in the 1995 BRAC round and was closed in 1998.  All information available at the time of publication relating to administrative responsibilities, technical responsibilities, performance requirements and workload estimates, are documented in the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). The PWS includes facilities management, operations, maintenance and repair functions required to safeguard and maintain facility services and systems the Army deems essential at SAEP during the Army's caretaker status phase.  The Government seeks to meet health, safety, and environmental protection concerns, and reduce operating costs at a facility that is in caretaker status and projected to undergo further operating reductions in the future.  These services are required until the Army is able to relinquish these responsibilities by transferring or selling the property.  Should the transfer of theproperty occur during the period of performance of the contract, the contract will be modified to incorporate: A revised PWS; an implementation schedule reflecting the early termination; and revised funding for the transition and implementation of the revised PWS and reduced period of performance. <br>  <br> It is the responsibility of potential offerors to be responsible for performing all operations and maintenance functions to support SAEP.  Historically this acquisition has been unrestricted, therefore, the information received from this SSS will determine, if qualified vendor exist for a competitive acquisition.  The information received from this SSS will be used by the Government as a preliminary planning tool for the purposes of obtaining information regarding the availability and capability of qualified businesses under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The associated size standard is $38.5 Million as measured by total revenues. The anticipated period of performance is one six-month base and a six month option. <br>  <br> EXISTING CONTRACT: <br>  <br> The U.S. Army currently contracts for caretaker services with a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract vehicle.  The current contract was awarded for one year under Contract Number W9124J-14-C-0064, valued at $4.0 M.  For informational purposes only, historical data regarding the dollar amount awarded under the current contract may be found on www.fpds.gov. <br>  <br> In accordance with FAR 10.001(a)(3)(i), in order to determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency need exists, the Government will consider all SSS responses received, particularly those received from 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, or small businesses.  Responses to this SSS permit the contracting officer, in accordance with FAR 19.203(c), to consider an acquisition for the small business socioeconomic concerns (i.e., 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, or WOSB programs) and to consider a small business set-aside (see 19.502-2(b)).  Small businesses, in all socioeconomic categories are highly encouraged to identify capabilities in meeting the requirements at fair market prices. Provide suggestions on how the requirement could be structured to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns. Describe any conditions, if any that may limit small businesses from participation. <br>  <br> SUBMITTAL INFORMATION: <br>  <br> The Government will not review general capability statements, please ensure submissions are tailored to this requirement and information requested below. There is a five (5) page limit, which offerors shall submit in PDF or MS Word Format.

<DESC>In accordance with (IAW) FAR 15.201(c) (3) this is a SOURCES SOUGHT FOR MARKET RESEARCH. This notice is a request for information to provide data for planning purposes only and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, a Solicitation, a Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the services contained in this Sources Sought.
<p>This request is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with this source sought or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for preparing a response as a result of this posting.</p>
<p>Any responses received will not be used as a proposal. Respondents will not be notified of the Sources Sought evaluation results, nor will questions be addressed by the Government.</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of Small Businesses (e.g. 8(a), Service-disabled Veteran owned small business, HUB Zone small business, and Women owned small business) that have the capability, experience and expert knowledge to provide a full characterization survey of sub-surface soil and groundwater, including the collection and analysis of environmental samples, for the Building 245 Radiation Physics Facility as described herein. The NAICS Code is 541620 with a size standard of $15.0 Million.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:<br />National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Gaithersburg, Maryland campus is a Research and Development (R&amp;D) facility with 52 buildings located on a 232 hectare site. NIST develops, maintains and disseminates the measurement standards for electromagnetic radiation and radioactivity in the United States. The work in the Radiation Physics Building (Building 245) currently supports industry through research, the realization and dissemination of the SI-derived standards for radiation dose (Gray, Gy) and radioactivity (becquerel, Bq), including for health, environmental, security, and manufacturing applications, and traceability to the SI (watt, W) for electromagnetic radiation in the visible, UV, and soft x-ray regimes. NIST also provides user facilities for radiometry measurements for other federal agencies and industrial partners. Calibration services and transfer standards for electromagnetic radiation provide critical traceability chains to NIST standards for secondary calibration labs serving customers in the medical, scientific, and industrial sectors. Research is ongoing to pursue advances in many aspects of metrology including those related to nuclear medicine, environmental radioactivity, medical imaging, advanced manufacturing, homeland security, and regulatory requirements for environmental stewardship.</p>
<p><br />Completed in 1964, Building 245 totals 208,000 gross sq. feet and was the first research facility built on the NIST Gaithersburg Campus. Purpose-built to accommodate the nation's radiation physics research, this is a highly specialized facility with concrete shield walls nearly 10 feet thick and large subterranean program areas located in basement and sub-basement levels. This unique constructed facility continues to support radiation physics measurements and research and is highly valued for its physical characteristics.</p>
<p>The agency is undertaking a significant modernization construction program to expand the radiation physics research laboratory and renovate existing building infrastructure. With nearly 55% of this facility below ground, a major task will include extensive excavation to the structure foundation walls for waterproofing and construction of de-watering systems to control persistent groundwater intrusion into the basement structure.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION/SCOPE/OBJECTIVE:<br />The objective of the anticipated acquisition is to award a single Firm Fixed Price contract to perform the radiological characterization survey of soil and groundwater adjacent to structural foundations where there have been known research activities inside the building that could produce radioactive activation products in the walls. The Agency seeks qualified, experienced environmental testing firms with the specific specialized professional expertise to perform the requirements of the project.</p>
<p>The scope of services to be performed at NIST shall include all drilling services to obtain soil core samples, collection, initial field testing and packaging/transport for radiochemical analysis, and contamination disposal fees (if applicable). Bores for samples will be drilled up to 50' below finished grade elevation. Initial task is to determine level of radiological contamination of soil from test bores at each location. Additional survey will determine and define the extent of radionuclide activation limits in surrounding in-situ soil, if discovered at the facility site. The work shall entail an initial field scoping investigation to determine the sampling pattern and location for baseline environmental samples in undisturbed soil.</p>
<p>The responsive Firm shall be required to demonstrate their technical expertise, qualifications and capability to effectively perform the scope of services described above. All respondents shall be evaluated during the selection process on the extent to which their response has demonstrated experience, technical expertise and past performance per the following criteria:</p>
<p><br />1. Related Project Experience: Successfully completed related radiological characterization projects that meet the specialized criteria of the solicitation requirements stated above within the past 84 months.</p>
<p>2. Professional qualifications and certifications of staff and proposed consultants with their relationship to the related project experience being sought above;</p>
<p>3. Corporate Experience- Clear, concise narrative of the firm's corporate experience and capabilities for performing the requirements.</p>
<p>4. Location of the firm and sub-consultants to be utilized (as defined by a nationally recognized mapping program) from the geographical area of NIST, Gaithersburg, MD campus.</p>
<p>Respondents shall provide:</p>
<p>a. A brief description of the technical requirements of each related project performed and relationship to the specialized experience criteria.</p>
<p>b. Each project's detail including the contract type, durations, contract value or fee.</p>
<p>c. Each submitted project's point-of-contact name, address, phone number and email address ( if available) with direct knowledge of the work performed.</p>
<p>d. Current firm staffing organization and active/open contracts from all sources by dollar ($) amount and whether government or non-government sector.</p>
<p>e. Affirmation of firm's business size as defined by this sources sought. Include CAGE, DUNS and or 8(a) certification and program expiration as applicable.</p>
<p>f. Identification if firm holds an active GSA Contract, Schedule 899; Environmental Services</p>

<SUBJECT>National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW)

<DESC><p>National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW)</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business) that can manage and administer a large-scale, multi-informant, nationally representative longitudinal survey.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE) in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) plans to conduct a survey, the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being, a nationally representative, longitudinal, multi-informant survey that provides information about children who come into contact with the child welfare system.</p>
<p>The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well Being was first established by the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act in 1996. Most recently, funding was authorized for NSCAW in the FY15 Omnibus Appropriations Bill (P.L. 113-235). The contract for conducting the survey with the first cohort (NSCAW I) was awarded 1997, and the study continued under several subsequent contract vehicles, all awarded to RTI International, the last of which expired in October 2014.<br /><br />The sample for the first cohort of NSCAW (NSCAW I) was selected from cases over a 15 month period in 1999-2000, and the children were followed for five to six years. About 5500 children ages 0-14 were included in the first cohort. Data were collected at baseline, 18 months and 36 months post-baseline, and approximately 60-72 months post-baseline. A second round of NSCAW (NSCAW II), begun in March 2008, closely followed the design of NSCAW I, with a new sample of about 5800 children; in the second cohort, children ages 0-18 were eligible for the sample. Three waves of data have been collected for NSCAW II: baseline, 18-month, and 36-month follow-ups. The field period for each data collection wave, for both cohorts, lasted approximately 15 months. The availability of the two NSCAW cohorts allowed for assessing changes in the characteristics of children and families in the system following the introduction of a number of significant policy changes. NSCAW data are archived and available to qualified researchers for analysis.</p>
<p>The goals of NSCAW are to: (1) Describe the children and families who come into contact with the child welfare system, (2) Examine child and family risk factors, service needs, and services received, and (3) Describe the child welfare system and the experience of children and families involved in the system, examine outcomes for these children and families, and describe the interaction of the child welfare system and services with other service systems. For more information about NSCAW methods and procedures, see the baseline reports for NSCAW I and NSCAW II at:</p>
<p>https://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/research/project/national-survey-of-child-and-adolescent-well-being-nscaw</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>Under a new contract, OPRE anticipates launching a third cohort of NSCAW. However, preliminary design work will explore the feasibility of further longitudinal data collection with existing samples, and the final design and scope of data collection will be determined in a design phase that will constitute the first task of the project.</p>
<p>Based on previous work in NSCAW, OPRE expects to complete the following key tasks for this project: (1) review and revise as appropriate the current survey design (2) obtain agreements to participate in the study from approximately 100 child welfare agencies, including obtaining necessary IRB clearances and meeting other legal requirements for obtaining child welfare records; (3) select a nationally representative sample of an estimated 5500-6000 children from approximately 100 counties in the United States; (4) hire and train a field staff who can collect data at the local level; (5) conduct two data collections with the sample, 18 months apart, consisting of in-home interviews and direct assessments with the sample children and their caregivers, as well as interviews with their caseworkers and questionnaires from their teachers; (6) consult experts, as needed, to provide specialized advice and guidance on any aspect of the work conducted under this project; (7) generate and release a series of briefs, reports, and other products to disseminate findings to a wide range of stakeholders; (8) prepare the data sets to be archived and made available to secondary users through the National Data Archive for Child Abuse and Neglect, including appropriate documentation and disclosure analysis; and (9) manage the project and ensure that all work is of highest quality, on time and within budget.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p>In order to successfully complete the key tasks outlined above, the following sub-tasks/deliverables-and the requisite skills, expertise, and corporate and staff capacity to engage in and successfully complete these subtasks/deliverables-are required:</p>

Develop a plan for meaningful involvement of consultants in design, analysis, and reporting tasks</p>
<p>g. Prepare the data sets to be archived and made available through public use and/or restricted use files, including appropriate documentation and disclosure analysis<br /><br />h. Generate and release a series of briefs, reports, and other products to disseminate findings to a wide range of stakeholders including practitioners, researchers, and policymakers:</p>
<p>a. Develop an analysis plan for the study that includes: the study logic model and research questions; a narrative discussion of the measures and analytic techniques to be utilized in answering each research question; relative advantages or disadvantages of approaches or methods; and, for each data source, the specific types of data analyses that will be employed.</p>
<p>b. Design a dissemination plan to disseminate findings to appropriate stakeholders. This may include draft, interim and final reports following periods of data collection, briefings to ACF and other relevant policy officials, conference presentations, working papers, scholarly journal articles, reports on special topics, and research/issue briefs.</p>
<p>i. Overall program management:</p>
<p>a. Manage the project and ensure that all work is of highest quality, on time and within budget.<br />b. Establish robust management and communication structures that account for the complexity of the project and need to coordinate with a range of stakeholders.</p>
<p>The minimum contractor requirements are:</p>
<p>1) Demonstrate sufficient and relevant corporate experience in successfully supporting studies of similar type, scope, and complexity, including substantial involvement by consultants or sub-contractors. Specifically, demonstrate the organizational capacity, capability and relevant prior experience to conduct a multi-site, large-scale survey involving high risk populations, often in distressed neighborhoods. <br /><br />2) Demonstrate capacity, capability and relevant experience to work simultaneously with geographically dispersed populations and manage large volumes of data for approximately 100 sites at the same time. In addition, demonstrate the availability of adequate computer/statistical resources and the institutional capability to process and analyze a large volume of data, including capacity to input data, clean data, and conduct quality control checks.</p>
<p>3) Staff should have the technical qualifications and academic, professional, and technical experience to successfully complete the requirements of the project as outlined above. Demonstrate staff capability, capacity and relevant experience in:</p>
<p>a. Relevant topical areas (e.g., child welfare, child development, health, social service systems, family functioning, legal and ethical issues), technical requirements (e.g., survey design and approach, including in complex sampling designs and longitudinal studies), and management requirements (e.g., relevant experience with direct management of large, geographically dispersed teams, including subcontractors, on complex project and contract oversight responsibilities).<br />b. Training, deployment, and management of a nationwide field staff<br />c. Innovative and rigorous research design of complex human service systems.<br />d. Collecting data in household settings, including the administration of standardized assessments for children of all ages.<br />e.

Conducting research in tribal communities.</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance:</p>
<p>It is anticipated that this project would start by September 30, 2015. Taking options into account, including those pertaining to the long-term follow-up studies, this project will likely extend through September 29, 2021.</p>
<p>Other Important Considerations:</p>
<p>The proposed project is large and complex in scope, and will require extensive interactions with state and local child welfare agencies, taking into account local legal and ethical requirements for obtaining access to records and to study respondents. In some cases, the study may require obtaining approvals from court personnel, from tribal governance entities, from the penal system and from other parties who may have jurisdiction or authority over the children in the sample. NSCAW follows laws governing mandatory reporting of child maltreatment that may be detected in the course of data collection; to date, the study has been successful in developing uniform consent procedures and uniform reporting procedures and guidelines that have been acceptable across states. The study must carefully maintain good relationships with the participating local and state agencies.</p>
<p>New work in NSCAW will require substantial attention to the feasibility and utility of maintaining continuity with prior NSCAW data collections. Given ACF's significant investment in the program and its congressional authorization, it is of the utmost importance that work conducted under this project is rigorous, timely, and of high quality.</p>

<SUBJECT>47' MOTOR LIFE BOAT SERVICE LIFE EXTENSION PROGRAM
<SOLNBR>HSCG40-15-R-60369
<RESPDATE>030615
<CONTACT>Kelly A. Wyatt, Phone 410-582-4720, Email Kelly.A.Wyatt@uscg.mil
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for 47' Motor Lifeboat (MLB) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) DRAFT Statement of Work and DRAFT Specification for Industry Review &amp; Comment.
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is a multi-mission organization tasked with maritime search and rescue, law enforcement, and environmental protection. One of the components for providing this capability in the coastal zone is the 47' MLB, which is self-righting and is capable of operating in up to 20 foot surf and 30 foot open ocean waves. The 47' MLB is constructed of marine grade aluminum and has twin-diesel engine propulsion with fixed-pitch propellers that provide a top speed of 25 knots. The first production 47' MLB entered service in 1997, and the last was delivered in 2003. Please see attachment for an overview of the 47' MLB.</p>
<p>The 47' MLB are in need of a major renovation to extend their service life primarily due to system obsolesce and reliability issues. The USCG has initiated a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) to execute these upgrades. The proposed upgrades are detailed in the attached DRAFT Statement of Work and DRAFT Specification. None of these modifications are intended to increase the operational capability of the boats, but will primarily consist of one-for-one replacement of existing systems and equipment. These modifications should not negatively affect the operational characteristics of the boat. There are a total of 117 of the 47' MLB's currently in the Coast Guard fleet, of which, up to107 could be inducted into the SLEP.</p>
<p>This notice is an RFI to allow industry to provide input on the DRAFT Statement of Work and DRAFT Specification in support of the 47' MLB SLEP. The following is a description of the proposed acquisition strategy:<br />The USCG is looking to award a fixed price, Requirements contract to a single Contractor to provide the major pieces of equipment necessary to complete the SLEP along with the associated engineering, on-site technical support, and logistics support, including drawing updates. The largest modification will be the replacement of the propulsion and power generation systems, which is why these will be a key focus of the proposal. <br />The USCG intends to provide a Statement of Work and Specification outlining the requirements for all boat modifications. Based on the documents, potential offerors will be requested to provide technical proposals that identify specific pieces of equipment that will meet the performance requirements, a detailed design proposal for the propulsion and power generation systems, arrangement drawings that show how all new equipment will be fit onto the boat, a notional weight and moment report showing that the proposed package will not impact weight limitations, a trim &amp; stability analysis showing that the new/relocated equipment will not affect the boats self-righting capability, and an electric power and load analysis showing overall power impacts. At the time the solicitation is released the Government will provide drawings and existing technical data as listed in the DRAFT Statement of Work. The Government intends to use a best value, trade-off analysis to evaluate the proposals and award a FFP contract with multiple option years, not to exceed eight (8) years.</p>
<p>After award, the Contractor would perform detailed engineering and design to incorporate the proposed equipment. The Contractor would have to pass two design reviews to validate the design solutions. The deliverables at this phase would be drawings, calculations, and design reports. The next phase would require the development of work packages consisting of work specifications, modification drawings, and production cost estimates. This information would be used to award a production contract to have a shipyard execute the modifications and install all equipment provided by the Contractor. The Contractor will also provide all technical documentation (including a list of all Original Equipment Manufacturer part numbers) and prepare lifecycle documents for the post-SLEP 47' MLB.</p>
<p>The USCG intends to perform the SLEP on one 47' MLB at the Coast Guard Yard as a prototype to verify and validate the Contractor's work packages and proposed system modifications. Under the contract, the Contractor would be responsible for providing all major pieces of equipment for the prototype availability and technical support during the availability period to ensure proper installation of all systems. The contract will include a prototype evaluation period for Coast Guard evaluation.</p>
<p>The Government's intent is for the base period of the contract to include the design of all systems, the corresponding modification work packages, all technical support documentation, and the delivery of equipment to the USCG Yard for the prototype availability. After successful completion of the prototype evaluation, the contract will be structured to have the Contractor provide complete equipment packages delivered on an "as-needed" basis in the form of delivery/task orders issued against a Requirements Contract for an estimated quantity of 107 boats as well as spare components for life-cycle support. The work packages developed by the Contractor will be used by the USCG to award shipyard availability contracts to the USCG Yard or commercial boat/shipyards for execution of the upgrades. The Contractor would be responsible for timely delivery of all equipment and engineering support during boat/shipyard availabilities for the remainder of the contract.</p>
<p>To summarize, the intended scope of supply would be:</p>
<p>a) Base Period:<br />a. Engineering calculations for all designs (propulsion, electrical, structural , etc)<br />b. One ship set of equipment identified in the proposal<br />c. Detailed design work packages (modification drawings, work instruction, and production estimates)<br />d. Equipment technical documentation<br />e. On-site technical support <br />f. Pre-production modifications based on the results of Operational Testing &amp; Evaluation</p>
<p>b) Option Periods (one per boat for up to 107 boats):<br />a. One ship set of equipment<br />b. On-site technical support <br />This is not a Solicitation, and proposals are not being requested at this time. Furthermore, there is not an anticipated date for release of a Solicitation at this point. This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of Contractor's information. The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted. <br />The NAICS code for this requirement is 336611 and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>Questions for Response:<br />1. Review the DRAFT Statement of Work and DRAFT Specification and provide actionable comments to improve these documents prior to release of this RFP.</p>
<p>2. Review and provide input to the following specific requirements from the DRAFT Specification: Section 233.3, Section 3.1; Section 233-14; and Section 252.</p>
<p>3. Based on the description of the proposal submission requirements and the information contained in the DRAFT Statement of Work &amp; DRAFT Specification, provide an estimate on the amount of time envisioned to prepare a complete proposal.</p>
<p>4. Provide recommendations on additional information that would assist offeror's in developing their proposals.</p>
<p>5. If the USCG was to provide the point design as Government Furnished information, how would this impact industry's ability to develop a technical proposal? Alternatively, if it was not provided, how would that affect industry's capability to provide a proposal?</p>
<p>6. Would the scope and structure of the proposed approach be feasible in the assessment of industry? What are the perceived risks and how could the USCG modify or improve this approach to limit risk for both parties?</p>
<p>7. The offerors would need to perform some level of engineering design and analysis in order to develop their proposals since the equipment identified in the proposal would become part of the fixed price contract. Would the level of design required to specify all pieces of equipment be feasible to offerors, given the potential scope of this requirement?</p>
<p>8. Would offerors feel a high level of confidence in providing a firm fixed price for follow-on option periods to provide equipment packages in support of boat/shipyard availabilities? What changes to the approach or level of information would be necessary to increase offeror's confidence?</p>
<p>9. Would offerors feel a high level of confidence in providing a firm fixed price for the base period described herein? What changes to the approach or level of information would be necessary to increase confidence and establish firm fixed prices?</p>
<p>The Coast Guard will hold a site visit to view a 47' MLB at the U.S. Coast Guard, 2401 Hawkins Point Road, Baltimore, MD, on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">March 10, 2015</span></strong>.

The USDA ARS does not anticipate other qualified sources; however, should any responses be received, they will be evaluated to determine if they can meet future needs of the Government. 7. Anticipated costs are expected to be fair and reasonable to the Government based on established catalog or market prices of commercial items sold in substantial quantities to the general public and when compared to similar items from other manufacturers'. 8. Market research was conducted appropriate to the circumstances of this requirement with no other sources being identified as capable of satisfying the agency requirements. Supplies were deemed to be available only from one source. 9. Selected vendor is the manufacturer of the required system. Reference FAR 13.106(b)(1) - For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. 10. No other sources have been identified. 11. An announcement of intent is being posted in order to determine if another source is more advantageous to the Government. 12. Data and representations included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate. 13.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: <p> Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a wireless, connection-free, open circuit technology that can be used for developing electrical devices such as sensors that need no physical contact with the properties being measured. At the core of the technology is the SansEC [Sans Electrical Connections] circuit, which is damage resilient and environmentally friendly to manufacture and use. The technology uses a NASA award-winning magnetic field response measurement acquisition device to provide power to the device and, in the case of a sensor application, to acquire physical property measurements from them. This fundamental new approach using open circuits enables applications such as sensors for axial load force, linear displacement, rotation, strain, pressure, torque, and motion sensing, as well as unique designs such as for a wireless keypad or wireless rotational dial, or for energy storage. The technology presents a fundamental change in the way electrical devices are designed, using an open circuit in conjunction with a floating electrode, or an electrically conductive object not connected to anything by wires, and powered through a wireless device. This system uses inductor-capacitor thin-film open circuit technology. It consists of a uniquely designed, electrically conductive geometric pattern that stores energy in both electric and magnetic fields, along with a floating electrode in proximity to the open circuit. When wirelessly pulsed from the handheld data acquisition system (U.S. patent 7,159,774, Magnetic Field Response Measurement Acquisition System), the system becomes electrically active and develops a capacitance between the two circuit surfaces. The result is a device that acts as a parallel plate capacitor without electrical connections. When applied to strain measurements, the sensor has been demonstrated to have a displacement and strain resolution of 3.9&#956;m and 0.6&#956;&#1297;, respectively.  U.S. patent 8,179,203. <p> To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.

For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at <A HREF="http://technology.nasa.gov/">http://technology.nasa.gov/ </A>  . <p> These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development OSACB for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: <p> Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a family of electrostrictive polymeric materials that are available for use by commercial companies. These innovative materials provide significant field-induced strain, high mechanical output force, and exceptional strain energy density. The NASA-developed electrostrictive polymers are conformable, lightweight, and durable. The processing system to fabricate these polymers is simple and can be manipulated to control and optimize the materials mechanical and electrical properties.	A variety of elastomers can be used for this technology, which enables grafting with materials like PVDF to provide electrostrictive behavior. NASA has invested in research related to these materials, the processing, and applications including sensing and actuation. The process can be tailored by: Molecular synthesis  selection of the appropriate polymer backbone and graft polar base Variation of the fraction of the two constituent polymers Variation of the molecular weight of the two constituent polymers Electroprocessing (poling) Thermal treatment Mechanical treatment <p> U.S. patents 6,545,391/6,515,077/6,724,130/6,867,533/6,689,288. <p> To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.

License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: <p> Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed novel method of depositing metal and metal oxide nanoparticles onto various substrates (see ACS Nano, 3(4), 871884 [2009]). It is rapid, scalable, and green since it does not require reducing agents or solvents. The process involves first mixing and then heating a metal salt (usually an acetate) with the desired substrate. Heating can be done by conventional thermal or microwave ovens. Conventional thermal processing takes several hours and requires an inert atmosphere, usually nitrogen. With microwave heating, the process is complete in a matter of seconds. The metal or metal oxide nanoparticles have potential use in electromagnetic applications. The nanoparticles have been evaluated for electromagnetic properties at high frequencies for potential antenna applications NASAs technology involves the development of tailorable dielectric materials by the deposition of metal nanoparticles on carbon nanotubes using a solvent-free method. The novel materials consist of aligned nanotubes decorated with nanometer dimension metal particles distributed in a polymer matrix. The tailorable complex permittivity parameters allow for an increased dielectric constant (e) with a decreased loss factor (e) (Figure 1). In addition, varying the amount of metal particles attached to the substrate surface can control the disconnection between the dielectric constant and the loss factor. The decoupling and independent control of these fundamental electrical material parameters afford a class of materials useful in a variety of applications in electronics, electromagnetics, and microwave engineering, with potential future applications in the optical frequency regime. Specific applications include the fabrication of fractal and geometric patterns (Figure 2) in antenna substrates, thereby improving antenna performance.

The increase in scope modification would extend the current contract three months, from 1 April 2015 through 30 June 2015. The modification for continued facilities maintenance services will be negotiated with incumbent contractor, Satellite Services, Inc., 7547 Waterside Loop Road, Suite B, Denver, NC 28037.
<p>The extension includes comprehensive commercially-available facilities maintenance and repair services for ATC Mobile. These services provide for upkeep of ATC Mobile's buildings, roads, grounds and other miscellaneous structures. They ensure buildings receive adequate maintenance to ensure supplies of water, sewer service, electricity, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to enable students, staff and faculty to execute training and ancillary services (messing, barracks, gym, generators, etc.) at its highest efficiency. The services must be performed by trained and experienced HVAC mechanics, electricians, plumbers, carpenters, grounds personnel, tractor operators, maintenance workers, janitors, motor mechanics and food service appliance mechanics to ensure industry standards are met.</p>
<p>An extension to contract will allow the established facilities and maintenance services being performed to continue, preventing the interruption of the maintaining of critical physical assets at the largest aviation training base in the US Coast Guard; and avoid significant duplication of associated start up costs.</p>
<p>Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, and all interested sources shall be considered by the US Coast Guard.</p>

The Midwest area for the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture intends to issue an award to Campbell Scientific, Inc., 815 West 1800, Logan, UT 84321. This is a sole source procurement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This is a requirement of the Cropping Systems and Water Quality Research Unit (CSWQRU), MWA, USDA at Columbia, Missouri for Data Loggers and Telemetry related equipment in order to improve and/or expand upon the existing Rain Gage/Radio Telemetry Network. The existing Radio Telemetry Network is designed to work together and communicate between each site as needed to transmit data to a central location. Therefore, all equipment has to be compatible using the same software. The current Network is controlled by Campbell Scientific, Inc. software and equipment. The current requirement of Data Loggers and Telemetry related equipment must be compatible with the existing software and equipment. The equipment and software from Campbell Scientific is proprietary. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. Interested parties should submit written (mail or email) responses, including prices and technical data sufficient to determine capability to meet the entire requirement. Responses must be received in this office within 10 calendar days after publication of this notice. It should be noted that no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source more advantageous to the government is available.

<p>SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:</p>
<p>Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>

Nature/Description of Actions(s) (FAR 6.303-2(a)(2)). <br />a. This contracting action is to obtain Data Loggers and Telemetry related equipment to be used for research purposes. <br />3. Description of Supplies/Services (FAR 6.303-2(a)(3)). <br />The requirement is to purchase Data Loggers and Telemetry related equipment in order to improve and/or expand upon the existing Rain Gage/Radio Telemetry Network. <br />4. Identification of Statutory Authority (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4)).<br />10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), FAR Subpart 6.302-1. The services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of services will satisfy the Agency requirements. <br />5.

Only one responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2))<br />(1) FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)) states,<br />"When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source, or for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, from only one or a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, full and open competition need not be provided for."<br />(2) The requirement is to purchase Data Loggers and Telemetry related equipment in order to improve and/or expand upon the existing Rain Gage/Radio Telemetry Network. The Cropping Systems and Water Quality Research Unit in Columbia, Missouri operate a Rain Gage/Radio Telemetry Network. The network is controlled by Campbell Scientific, Inc. equipment and software. Any equipment that is purchased to improve and/or expand upon the existing network must be compatible with the existing software. The equipment and software from Campbell Scientific, Inc. are proprietary. In 2008, extensive market research was done in order to determine the best option for upgrading the Rain Gage Network. It was determined that Campbell Scientific, Inc. was the best option. Therefore, a decision was made to purchase all equipment related to data loggers and telemetry equipment from Campbell Scientific, Inc. in order to guarantee compatibility across all sites included in the system. It was also determined that future purchases of equipment and/or software to improve and/or expand upon the Rain Gage/Radio Telemetry Network would also need to be purchased from Campbell Scientific, Inc. because of the importance of compatibility and the proprietary properties of the equipment and software. <br />6. Federal Business Opportunities - FedBizOpp.gov (FBO) Announcement/Potential Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6)).<br />a. A Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) synopsis is published in an attempt to identify other possible vendors of the required consumable.<br />b.

Description of Market Research (FAR 6.303-2(a)(8)). <br />Extensive market research was done in order to determine the best option for upgrading the Rain Gage Network. It was determined that Campbell Scientific, Inc. was the best option. It was also determined that future purchases of equipment and/or software to improve and/or expand the Rain Gage/Radio Telemetry Network would also need to be purchased from Campbell Scientific, Inc. because of the importance of compatibility and the proprietary properties of the equipment and software. There were also comparisons with other vendors who sold similar equipment. <br />9. Any Other Supporting Facts (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9))<br />There are no other supporting facts. <br />10. Listing of Interested Sources (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10)).<br />No other sources are available at this time.<br />11. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Competition (FAR 6.303(a)(11)).<br />A notice of intent to award on a sole source basis is posted in FedBizOpps in order to see if any other vendors could possible meet the entire requirement. <br />12. Technical Requirements and Certifications; (FAR 6.303-1(b) and FAR 6.303-2(b)).<br />I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification are complete and accurate.</p>

Orders for additional consumable supplies will be made by the key operators. <br> 2.	The vendor must deliver additional consumable supplies within a period of twenty-four hours after receipt of verbal order.  <br> 3.	Supplies from the vendor shall be delivered between 7;30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday (excluding Federal holidays) directly to the copier location. <br>  <br> MAINTENANCE <br>  <br>  	Preventive Maintenance:  The vendor will provide at a minimum, one yearly service call as a preventive maintenance service to ensure that the copiers furnished are maintained in good working condition.  Such preventive maintenance shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and will be equal to maintenance, which is provided to commercial customers for the same models of copiers. <br>  <br>  	Response to Service Calls:  The vendor will respond to service calls during normal working hours, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays observed by the Federal Government.  The vendor must respond to verbal service calls within four (4) working hours after notification of malfunction.  Service calls for machines identified as critical shall be responded to within two (2) working hours.  The response time on a service call starts when the authorized personnel of a participating agency/activity places a service call to the vendor.  The service technician will report to the agency/activity requesting service and notify them of his/her arrival and verify the problem for which the service call was made.  After the call is completed, the service technician will contact the service requestor, key operator, or any government employee within the office, whether or not the service is completed satisfactory. <br>  <br>  	The vendor must provide a toll-free telephone number for service calls which must be answered during at least eight working hours, between 7:30 am and 4:00 pm, Monday through Friday, and manned in such a way that the caller will not be  quote mark on hold quote mark  for more than three (3) minutes in the process of reporting a service requirement. <br>  <br> TECHNICAL MAINTENANCE SUPPORT <br>  <br>  	The vendor must have sufficient management and qualified dedicated technicians to service the copiers.

They are intended to remain in place for the remainder of the contract period. <br>  <br>  	Backup copiers are those that are installed in place of malfunctioning copiers in order to provide temporary relief until the original equipment is repaired or until replacement copiers are installed. <br>  <br>  	Replacement copiers-Printers:  During the contract period, should the repair record of any copiers reflect a downtime of 10% or more of the normal working day in one 30 day period, a determination will be made by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) to replace the initial copiers with new copiers, or to have the vendor's management representative certify on the repair record that sufficient repairs have been made to preclude additional abnormal breakdowns.  In those cases where a copier, having been certified as above, continues to suffer an abnormal rate of breakdowns for two consecutive months, the vendor must provide a replacement.  The responsibility for maintaining copiers furnished is the sole responsibility of the vendor. <br>  <br>  	Back-up Equipment:  When a copier cannot be repaired within 16 working hours after a satisfactory response to notification of any malfunction, it will be the option of the COR to request backup equipment.  Back-up equipment can only be requested by the COR.  If requested, the vendor must have the capability to deliver backup equipment within sixteen (16) working hours of notice.  Backup equipment must meet or exceed the capabilities of the basic machine to be replaced (with the exception of facsimile and networking capabilities), at the same cost rate for the location.  Backup equipment may only remain in place for a maximum of 80 working hours.  By the expiration of this time, if the original machine has not been repaired, the vendor must provide a replacement machine of the same make and model, or better, as the original copiers upon removal of the back-up machine.  It will be the vendor's responsibility to provide the COR with the serial number, location, and model number of the replacement copiers. <br>  <br>  <br> 		 <br> Place of Performance: <br> 	 <br> 		Detroit Arsenal  <br> Warren, Mi 48088 <br>  <br> A.

Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer).

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>B. Background/Scope<br />Third party accreditation by an internationally recognized, International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and/or International Accreditation Forum (IAF), and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 17011 conforming accrediting body for FDA laboratories is necessary to maintain accreditation status in compliance with the ISO 17025, and the Association of Official Analytical Communities (AOAC) guidelines for laboratories performing microbiological and chemical analyses of food and pharmaceuticals.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2) <br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to:<br />(A) Change the name in the SAM database; <br />(B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR;<br />(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.<br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations. <br />(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern:<br />(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.<br />(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

<p>52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -</p>
<p>(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);</p>
<p>(C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and</p>
<p>(D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items. (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p><br />Technical / Non-Price Evaluation Factors. The three non-price factors listed here will be equally considered for the purposes of evaluation. An unacceptable rating by the Government for any of these factors will preclude contract award.</p>
<p>(1) Safety. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's safety record. (See Paragraph L- 2.)</p>
<p>(2) Experience and Qualifications. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's experience and qualifications, including (a) the relevance of Offeror's experience; (b) the quantity of Offeror's experience; and (c) Offeror qualifications, including, but not limited to FAA licensing, medical certification, experience required in Forest Service Manual to perform work anticipated under contract, and qualifications specific to operating the DHC-6 Twin Otter and the C23 Sherpa.</p>
<p>NOTE: YOUR SUBMISSION MUST CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE HOW YOU MEET THE ABOVE REQUIREMENTS. Include in your submission a copy of your:</p>
<p>FAA Pilot Certificate verifying applicable ratings pertinent to this solicitation.<br />Current FAA Class I or Class II Medical Certificate<br />Your last 12 months pilot log book <br />Interagency Pilot Qualification card indicating your qualification as a Smokejumper Captain Authorization as a Smokejumper Instructor Pilot</p>
<p>(3) Past Performance. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance on same or similar work and will consider information submitted by the Offeror, obtained from references or obtained by the Government from other sources that is relevant to the following elements: (a) Quality of Service; (b) Timeliness of Performance; (c) Customer Satisfaction/Working Relationships. In evaluating past performance, the Government will consider the currency and relevancy of the information provided or obtained, the context of the data and the general trends of Offeror's performance. In conformance with Federal Acquisition Regulations, Offerors that have no record of past performance will receive a neutral rating. (See Paragraph L- 2.)</p>
<p>*Note: Offerors may enhance their technical proposal by identifying strengths, personnel skills and knowledge, unique capabilities and value adding processes to a contract's services, and other attributes that the Government considers as discriminating factors.</p>
<p>The Government may research offeror performance on any federal, state, local, and commercial contract performance of the offeror that is known to the Government, but not included on the submitted Performance Information. Additionally, personal experience and evaluator knowledge of offeror performance may be utilized.</p>
<p>The Government will consider the relevance of past performance information obtained in relation to the scope of this procurement with respect to both a similar efforts, and the length and scope, number, complexity, and diversity of contracts completed by the firm. Past performance, either positive or negative, which is considered by the Government to be more closely related to the scope of this effort will be given additional weight in the evaluation process.</p>
<p>Offerors with past performance data will be evaluated in the same manner as all other evaluation factors; however, those offerors with no past performance data will treated as an unknown performance risk and neither be evaluated favorably nor unfavorably. Therefore, offerors will receive credit for good past performance, lose credit for poor past performance, and neither receive nor lose credit for, no relevant past performance.</p>
<p>*A contractor would be highly rated under Relevant Past Performance if, in the last three years, the Contractor has completed in a timely manner, with a pay range of 95-100%, with high customer satisfaction/business relations in contracts.</p>
<p>4. Cost/Price Evaluation Criterion.</p>
<p>The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factors on which selection is to be based, or when the price is so significantly high as to diminish the value of the technical superiority to the Government.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are equal to price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of provision)</p>

The price proposal shall be submitted with the solicitation forms, no breakdown of the unit price is required. The technical proposal must not contain reference to cost; however, resource information (such as data concerning labor hours and categories, materials, subcontracts, etc.) must be contained in the technical proposal so that the contractor's understanding of the statement of work may be evaluated.</p>
<p>(2) Offerors are cautioned that sufficient and detailed information must be presented in their technical proposals to enable the Government to evaluate their proposals fully in accordance with the evaluation and award criteria contained herein. The Government is not obligated to ask for additional information and in the absence of appropriate information the proposal will be rated deficient.</p>
<p>(3) The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with FAR Clause 52.212-2 "Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999)" evaluation criteria as set forth herein.</p>
<p>(4) Offerors shall submit their proposal(s) in the following format and the quantities specified:<br />(i) 1 copy of the completed, signed offer (The solicitation package)<br />(ii) 3 copies of the Technical Proposal/Documentation Resulting from the Government's Statement of Objectives<br />(iii) In addition to a successful firm's response to the solicitation, responses to all Evaluation Factors excepting Relevant Past Performance will be incorporated into the resulting contract by reference at time of award and retain the full force and effect as all of the other contractual terms and conditions hold therein.</p>

<p><br />(iii) Past Performance: Offeror shall demonstrate satisfactory performance of same or similar work on previous contracts. The offeror shall complete a list for all relevant projects completed during the past three years and all contracts and subcontracts in progress. The list should include, but is not limited to, contracts and subcontracts similar in nature and complexity to that required by this solicitation. Include contracts with the Federal Government, agencies of state, and local governments, and commercial customers. Offerors that are newly formed entities, without prior contracts as an entity, should list contracts and subcontracts completed by all personnel deemed vital to successful performance. Firms with no experience in the type of work described may show: similar type projects which demonstrate their ability to perform in a timely manner, experience, and past performance of their employees, or their work as a subcontractor. Include the following information for each contract/subcontract:<br />A) Project name<br />B) Contract number<br />C) Location<br />D) Year of completion, or anticipated completion date if in progress<br />E) Contract administrator's name, phone and facsimile numbers<br />F) Your crew supervisors and any inspectors who worked on the project<br />G) Project size <br />H) Quality of work performed <br />I) Whether the contract was completed timely</p>
<p>The offeror may provide information on problems encountered on the contracts and subcontracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve those problems. The Government may obtain information from existing contract files. Because discussions may not be held, the offeror may refute any problems in the original offer.</p>
<p>Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts of a similar nature. Performance information will be used as an evaluation factor against which offerors' relative rankings will be compared to assure best value to the Government. The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration. The Government may contact references beyond those identified by the offeror to obtain additional information for use in both the responsibility determination and in further evaluation of the offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>Note: If the contractor does not provide past performance information, or indicate a lack of Past Performance with its offer, the Contracting Officer need not pursue further information if it is clear that the offeror's price is not competitive.</p>
<p>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has authorized Federal agencies to collect past performance information under OMB clearance number 9000-0142.</p>
<p>(2) Price.</p>
<p>(i) Price Schedule. The Government will evaluate Offeror's prices submitted on the Schedule of Items found in Secition B. A firm's completion and submission of Blocks 19 through 24 of the subject solicitation's Standard Form 1449 (Page 1 &amp; 2) and completing section B of this solicitation constitutes the fulfillment of the Government's price proposal requirements under this solicitation.</p>
<p><br />(c) Award Statement. Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government, technical and price factors considered. Evalution factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price in the award decision. The critical factor in making any price/technical trade-offs is not the spread between the technical ratings, but rather the significance of that difference. The significance of the difference in ratings will be determined on the basis of what that difference is and what it would cost the Government to take advantage of it. Award may not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for fulfilling the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to make price/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest and advantageous to the Government.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without dicussions with Offerors. Proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms, from a price and technical standpoint, which the Offeror can submit to the Government. However, the Government may, after evaluation of proposals, conduct further oral or written discussions as appropriate, with all offerors whose proposals are within a competitive range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>452.215-72 Amendments to Proposals. (FEB 1988)</p>
<p>Any changes to a proposal made by the offeror after its initial submittal shall be accomplished by replacement pages. Changes from the original page shall be indicated on the outside margin by vertical lines adjacent to the change.

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p>(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

This is an unrestricted solicitation. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-61. The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 621340 and the Small Business size standard is $7.0 million.<br /><br />The contract resulting from this solicitation is a Firm Fixed-Price, Non-Personal Healthcare Service Purchase Order.<br /><br /><strong>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:</strong><br /><br />April 1, 2015 thru June 30, 2015<br /><br /><strong>SECURITY CLEARANCE:<br /></strong><br />Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the Indian Health Service (I.H.S.). Before starting work requiring routine access to I.H.S. facilities or systems each person must complete a FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an I.H.S. employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />The Indian Health Service utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the EQIP entry to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the service unit for this purpose.<br /><br />In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov.

During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.<br /><br />The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.<br /><br />Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).<br /><br />The Contractor will need a DUNS number, TIN number, and be registered with www.SAM.gov.<br /><br /><strong>PURPOSE OF CONTRACT:<br /></strong><br />See attached Schedule and Statement of Work.<br /><br />Location is at the Rosebud IHS Hospital, 400 Soldier Creek Road, Rosebud, South Dakota, 57570.<br /><br /><strong>PRICE SCHEDULE (SF-18):<br /></strong><br />Physical Therapist Services- the quoted unit pricing must be an all-inclusive cost (to include but not be limited to transportation, food, lodging, per diem, and fringe benefits).

<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS<br />March 16, 2015<br /><br />PERIOD OF PROPOSAL SUBMISSION ENDS:<br />April 6, 2015
<p><br />ABOUT PROPOSALS. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (hereafter "the Commission") invites submission of proposals to provide a one-time unclassified report on China's efforts to expand the international use of its currency, the renminbi (RMB).</p>
<p>ABOUT THE COMMISSION. The Commission was established by Congress in 2000 to monitor and report to Congress on the economic and national security dimensions of the United States' trade and economic ties with the People's Republic of China. Further details about the Commission are available on its website at: www.uscc.gov.</p>
<p>The Commission solicits this research pursuant to its Congressional mandate (contained in P.L. 113-291, Section 1259B), which states that "The Commission ... shall investigate and report on ...</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;(G) The national budget, fiscal policy, monetary policy, capital controls, and currency management practices of the People's Republic of China, their impact on internal stability in the People's Republic of China, and their implications for the United States."</p>
<p>The report's key research requirements are:</p>
<p>1. Provide a detailed description of the efforts by the Chinese government to allow and, in some cases, encourage its trading partners greater use of the RMB in settling international trade accounts through the use of currency swaps. In addition, address the following topics: <br />&bull; The relaxation of restrictions on currency conversions from RMB to Hong Kong dollars. <br />&bull; Hong Kong banks that are allowed to take deposits and make loans in RMB. <br />&bull; The opening of foreign exchange markets in Singapore, Taipei, London and Luxembourg to trade in RMB. <br />&bull; The potential use of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone in facilitating the use of RMB in international trade. <br />&bull; The proliferation of RMB-denominated bonds issued in Hong Kong (Dim Sum bonds). <br />&bull; The relaxation of China's capital controls to allow increasing sums of RMB to be converted and transferred abroad. <br />&bull; The expansion of the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) and RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) quotas. <br />&bull; The Stock Connect program that links the stock exchanges of Shanghai and Hong Kong. <br />&bull; The relationship between China's growing foreign direct investment abroad and greater internationalization of the RMB. <br />&bull; Any efforts by the People's Bank of China to aid in currency conversion, particularly through the use of swaps with other central banks.</p>
<p>2. The report should also examine questionable or illegal means used to circumvent mainland China's restrictions on the movement of capital. These means may include: <br />&bull; The continuing use of casinos in Macau by mainland Chinese citizens to launder money for transfers abroad. <br />&bull; The efforts by Chinese citizens to use purchases of U.S. residential real estate as a means to transfer money abroad. <br />&bull; The use within China of fraudulent export bills of lading in order to hide the true extent of capital flight. <br />&bull; Chinese investment in the United States through the U.S. H1-B visa program. <br />&bull; Tuition payment for college or university students from China studying abroad.</p>
<p>3. The report should also address the relationship, if any, between the efforts to internationalize the RMB and the possible use of the RMB as an international reserve currency. It should examine the likelihood and implications for the United States of the potential for a more rapid and complete process of internationalization than is currently the case. These factors may include:<br />&bull; The potential effects on the U.S. economy of diminished demand for U.S. Treasury securities as a store of value for international investors, should the RMB join the euro and the Japanese yen as an alternative to dollar-denominated investments.<br />&bull; The potential effects on the U.S. economy of a diminished role for the dollar in international trade settlements, particularly in the case of trade in petroleum and related energy products and manufactured goods.<br />&bull; The impact on the value of the dollar should the use of the RMB substantially increase in international trade settlements and investment. <br />&bull; The current currency composition of official foreign exchange reserves, including the role of the dollar, and how it has changed over the past decade.</p>
<p>The report should include an executive summary of the report's key findings; a brief overview of the sources and analytic methodology used for the report; and a brief explanation of the scope and limitations of the report.</p>
<p>Additional Requirements:</p>
<p>1. Prior to the award of any contract, the contractor must be registered in the federal System for Award Management (SAM).</p>
<p>2. Once the Commission selects a contractor for this project, and a contract is signed, public notice of this will be made on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>3. The Commission's goal is to have a report prepared for review in a timely fashion. In ordinary circumstances, once the Commission selects a contractor and a contract is signed, a draft report must be submitted to the Commission for review no later than 120 days from the date the contract is signed. The Commission will then endeavor to provide comments and requests for adjustments within 30 days; subsequently, the final report must be submitted within 30 days of formal receipt of the Commission's comments. The Commission recognizes, under certain circumstances, a contractor may wish to have more time to prepare the first draft of the report under the contract. The contractor, in their contract proposal, should stipulate the time frame for submission of the draft report. It is to be understood; however, that time is of the essence in completing research contracts for the Commission.</p>
<p>4. As work on the report progresses, the Commission's Research Director shall act as the Commission's representative in monitoring the progress, quality, and responsiveness of the report to the major issues of concern identified in this Request for Proposals (RFP). The Research Director shall, on request to the contractor, be entitled to informal briefings on the status of the research work and to readings of the draft in progress.</p>
<p>5. The report shall be free of typographical errors and conform to the Chicago Manual of Style. Upon receipt of all drafts, the Commission will inspect the document for typographical errors and deviations from the Chicago Manual of Style guidelines. At the discretion of the Commission, if a draft contains excessive deficiencies, the Commission will return the draft to the contractor and request the contractor cure the draft of deficiencies within five (5) working days (not counting weekends and Federal holidays). Upon resubmission of the draft by the contractor to the Commission, should deficiencies remain, the Commission, at its discretion, will submit the draft to its copyeditor for correction, the cost of which ($43.98 per hour) will be deducted from the final cost of the contract. The contract shall be subject to termination if the Commission deems that the work is of unsatisfactory quality.</p>
<p>6. At the Commission's discretion, the report procured via this RFP may be posted on the Commission's website.</p>
<p>7. Each organization or individual responding to this request must warrant they will perform this work solely for the Commission, and the resulting report will not be shared with other parties without the prior written consent of the Commission.</p>
<p>8. The Commission expects contractors to identify all personnel working on the contract, and that there will not be any delegation of responsibilities to other parties without prior written approval of the Commission.</p>
<p>9. After completion of the report, the Commission staff, in consultation with the contractor, will prepare a short summary of the research for posting on the Commission's website and other media. The Commission staff shall consult with the contractor in preparing said document.</p>
<p>10. At the discretion and request of the Commission, the contractor shall agree to participate in up for four (4) separate briefings, and up to one (1) public hearing, held by the Commission, of up to two (2) hours each in the Washington, D.C. area, supported by at least one (1) individual affiliated with the contractor identified as "key personnel." This could include, but not necessarily be limited to, briefing the content of the research to Commissioners and Commission staff, appearing as witnesses at a public hearing held by the Commission, and briefing the content of the research to Members of Congress and/or their staff. No additional remuneration will be provided to the contractor for these briefings or a hearing. The Commission will make a good faith effort to schedule briefings and a hearing at times that are subject to mutual agreement.</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />Primary Selection Criteria:</p>
<p>1. The Commission will determine which organization or individual responding to this request will be awarded the contract based on a comprehensive "best value" analysis of the proposals received, to include costs, technical value, and ability to complete the work satisfactorily and on time, and past performance with the Commission, if applicable.</p>
<p>2. The primary weighting criterion in selection shall be the assessed qualifications and ability of an organization or individual to address the fundamental research points enunciated above ("key research requirements").</p>
<p>3. The cost and amount of time necessary to complete the report will also be considered as criteria in the selection process.</p>
<p>Proposal submissions should include:</p>
<p>1. A statement of the applicant's relevant qualifications to satisfy the terms of this RFP, to include curricula vitae for personnel intended for work on the project.</p>
<p>2. Identification of the principal researchers who will be responsible for the preparation of the report. It is understood that the designation of the researchers is a critical element of the proposal, and any changes regarding which individuals will be involved in the report's preparation must be approved by the Commission in advance and in writing.</p>
<p>3. A description of the research methodology the applicant proposes to employ. In describing methodology, the submission should provide detailed descriptions of the sources and methods that will be used to research the report's topic and the extent to which Chinese language sources, if any, and other primary materials will be used.</p>
<p>4. A list of any entities for whom you have conducted research or provided consulting services in the past. The Commission understands you may be limited in providing such information by confidentiality agreements.</p>
<p>5. An estimate of the time the applicant will need to complete the required work.</p>
<p>6. The price the applicant will charge to the Commission to complete the work set forth in this RFP.</p>
<p>Organizations and individuals wishing to submit a proposal in response to this RFP must ensure that the response arrives at the location noted below by 5:30PM (EST) on April 6, 2015, or it will not be accepted or considered.</p>
<p>Electronic submissions are acceptable.</p>
<p>Proposals, as well as inquiries or any other correspondence related to this matter, should be directed to:</p>

All parts must have clear traceability to the original equipment manufacturers (OEM), Airbus Helicopters France (Cage Code F0210) and Bronzavia Air Equipement Div Equipements Embarques (F6184). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or authorized distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the following items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>*** 16 March 2015 ***
<p>This solicitation is modified to extend the due date for proposals to 27 April 2015, 2 pm EDT.</p>
<p>There have also been some questions regarding the purchase description. The questions along with the engineer's response is provided below.</p>
<p><br />Question: <br />4.4. User Interface: The Distortion Analyzer shall maximize the use of electronically programmable interfaced components. The format of the interface shall be IEEE 488.2 Standard. The Distortion Analyzer shall also make use of all programmable components to perform automated measurements via a government owned programmable system controller.</p>
<p><br />Can you tell me what the GPIB controller will be used for in this application as it is not defined in the PD. It appears from section 4.4 of the PD that more features are desired than are clearly defined.</p>
<p><br />Response:<br />The specifics on how we will automate the distortion analyzer are irrelevant. Paragraph 4.4 is only requiring the distortion analyzer to have an IEEE 488.2 interface, or GPIB connector, that will allow us to automate the instrument. The second sentence requires that the contractor maximize the instruments ability to be automated, meaning that anything that can and should be done automatically (measurements, functions, etc.) be included.</p>
<p>Question:<br />What was the original make and model of the instrument that you are replacing?</p>
<p>Response:<br />A combination of the Hewlett Packard 334A and 8903A</p>
<p>Questions:<br />1. Paragraph 3.3 Voltage Input<br />a. What is meant by this specification?<br />1. Is the 0.3 to 200V a peak, peak-to-peak or rms voltage?<br />2. Is this an input voltage that can be &plusmn;3% above and below the 0.3 to 200V?<br />3. Is this a voltmeter mode where the distortion analyzer can measure voltage to with a &plusmn;3%<br />accuracy full scale?<br />2. Paragraph 3.4 Distortion Levels<br />a. Do you really want the distortion analyzer to measure 100% distortion level? Our distortion<br />analyzer measures to the 10th harmonic and 20% distortion max.<br />3. Paragraph 3.5 Distortion Measurement Accuracy<br />a. Do you really need 7 full scale distortion ranges?<br />b. Do you want these ranges to be switch selectable via the front panel?<br />c. Our instrument is totally automatic with auto-ranging and auto-leveling which basically makes<br />it hands-free operation; would this be acceptable?<br />4. Paragraph 3.6 Input Impedance<br />a. Can you live with an input impedance of 110k ohms in parallel with a 100pF?</p>
<p>Responses:<br />1. Paragraph 3.3 Voltage Input</p>
<p>a. This is the input voltage where the Distortion Analyzer must be capable of measuring distortion.</p>
<p>1. RMS</p>
<p>2. Yes</p>
<p>3. The Distortion Analyzer should be capable of measuring the voltage to determine if the input voltage is within the +/-3% of full scale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Paragraph 3.4 Distortion Levels</p>
<p>a. Yes, the requirement is to measure 100% distortion levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Paragraph 3.5 Distortion Measurement Accuracy</p>
<p>a. The accuracy is based on the 7 full scale ranges described in 3.5. As long as the Distortion Analyzer can meet these accuracies, ranges can be varied.</p>
<p>b. There are no requirements on how ranges are selected/changed.</p>
<p>c. There are no requirements on how ranges are selected/changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Paragraph 3.6 Input Impedance</p>
<p>a. No.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.    <br>        <br>    	HQ Army Materiel Command	    <br>    	Office of Command Counsel    <br>    	9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401    <br>    	Ft.

<p><strong>METHOD OF EVALUATION AND BASIS FOR AWARD</strong></p>
<p>Best Value Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>The Government anticipates award of a single Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Purchase Order to the Contractor whose quotation is the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Quotations will be evaluated based on the details described in the evaluation factors below. When combined, non-price factors are more important than price. Award will be made to the Contractor whose quotation is determined to be the best value in accordance with this RFQ. Therefore, the Government may award to other than the lowest priced Contractor or the highest technically rated Contractor utilizing trade-offs. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and may award a purchase order without discussions. Therefore, each initial quotation should contain the contractor's best quotation from both a price and a non-price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>EVALUATION FACTORS</strong></p>
<p>Factor 1 - Relevant Experience and Key Personnel Qualifications</p>
<p>Relevant Experience and Key Personnel: The Government will evaluate the extent to which the experience submitted for the contractor's proposed key personnel demonstrate they have appropriate knowledge, qualifications, and experience to efficiently and effectively manage and perform the requirements and ensure the technical quality of deliverables. The government will evaluate the degree to which the relevant experience and key personnel will likely meet or exceed task objectives and promote the likelihood of success.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the extent of the quoter's experience and the experience of its key personnel in providing similar services. Stronger consideration will be given to the quote that demonstrates experience delivering the same or similar types of services described throughout the Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Contractors past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the Contractor has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past three years. In assessing the Contractor's past performance information, the Government will evaluate, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of services, and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information from sources other than those described by the Contractor in its quotation, e.g. Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) and any other reference information the Government obtains on its own. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the Contractor has no relevant past performance information.<br /><br /><br />Evaluation of Price (Part II)</p>
<p>Quotations will be evaluated using price analysis techniques to determine a price fair and reasonable. A determination will be made by the Contracting Officer based upon the information provided. The Government reserves the right to ask for any additional price related information from the Contractor in order to determine a price fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>The Government may award to other than the lowest priced Quoter or the highest technically rated quote utilizing trade-offs. Pricing will be evaluated separately from technical factors and used as a trade-off between the technical factors.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>IX. The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999), applies to this acquisition. Please see the addendum below.</p>
<p>Addendum to FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award one contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation is determined to be the best value quote utilizing FAR Parts 12 and 13. The Government may award without discussions; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in the Government's best interest.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Factors are:<br />I. Factor 1 - Price <br />II. Factor 2 - Ability to meet the Government's requirement</p>
<p><br />i. Price: All quoters' proposed prices will be determined by adding the proposed price for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) to confirm the extended amount and the total amount. The total evaluated price will include all option periods. FAR 52.217-8 will be evaluated by utilizing the final option period's (CLIN 1001) proposed pricing. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and completeness of the total evaluated price.</p>
<p>ii. Ability to meet the government's requirement: <br />Only those quotes determined acceptable will be considered for further evaluation. In order to be considered awardable, there must be an "acceptable" rating in every sub-factor.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 1: The Government technical/quality evaluation team shall evaluate the quotes on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. Ratings will be assigned as follows:</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CRITERIA RATINGS<br />RATING DEFINITION<br />Acceptable Quote clearly meets the minimum requirements of the PWS, attachment 1.<br />Unacceptable Quote does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Sub-Factor 2: Past Performance: Past Performance will be evaluated based on subjective assessment of how well the quoter performed on past recent and relevant work, as outlined in Addendum to FAR Provision 52.212-1. Quoter must receive an Acceptable rating to receive an award. This rating is based upon quoter-provided information, or information obtained from any other sources of past performance information, indicating performance of same or similar rquirement as follows:</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE<br />RATING DEFINITION<br />Acceptable Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the quoter will successfully perform the required effort, or the quoter's performance record is unknown.<br />Unacceptable Based on the quoter's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the quoter will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>The Past Performance information may be obtained from the following sources: <br />(A) Reference List (Please see details in the Addenda to FAR 52.212-1). <br />(B) Past Performance Information available from other sources such as Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) or Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS).</p>
<p>iv. Award Process: The Government intends to award to the best value quote. In accordance with 13.106-2(b)(3), the Government is not required to establish a competitive range, conduct discussions, or score quotes. Consistent with simplified acquisition procedures, the evaluation process is as follows:</p>
<p>i. Price: The Government will evaluate all quotes for price, ranking the quoters from lowest to highest total evaluated price.</p>
<p>ii. Ability to meer the Government's Requirement: The lowest priced quote will then be evaluated for Technical Acceptability. Quotes must be rated technically "Acceptable". If the lowest priced quoter's technical quote is "Unacceptable", the next low quoter's technical quote will be evaluated, continuing until an quoter with an "Acceptable" technical rating is identified. The lowest priced, technically "Acceptable" quoter's past performance will be evaluated.</p>
<p>iii. The Government reserves the right that: If the lowest priced, technically "Acceptable" quoter's past performance is determined to be "Acceptable", the evaluation process may stop and the award may be made to that quoter, pending an affirmative price fair and reasonable determination. If it is determined to be in the best interest of the government, the government will continue with the evaluation and reserves the right to enter into discussions any time during the evaluation process.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate quotes for award purposes by adding the total price for all options, to include FAR 52.217-8, "Option to Extend Services", to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an quote is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the quote's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an quote (or part of an quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>X. Quoters shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Quoter Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items (Dec 2014), Alternate I (Oct2014), with their quote, or complete paragraph (b) of 52.212-3, if the quoter has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://www.sam.gov.</p>

LAW GOVERNING CONTRACTS (JAN 2005) - In any dispute arising out of this contract, the decision of which requires consideration of law questions, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be interpreted and determined in accordance with the substantive laws of the United States of America.<br />4. LEGAL STATUS (JAN 2005) - The NAFI is an integral part of the Department of Defense and is an instrumentality of the United States Government. Therefore, NAFI contracts are United States Government contracts; however, they do not obligate appropriated funds of the United States. <br />5. ASSIGNMENT (JAN 2005) - The Contractor or its assignee's rights to be paid amounts due as a result of performance of this contract, may be assigned. No assignment by the Contractor, assigning its rights or delegating its obligations under this contract will be effective and binding on the NAFI until the written terms of the assignment have been approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.<br />6. GRATUITIES (JAN 2005)<br />a. The NAFI may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right of the Contractor to proceed under this contract if it is found, after notice and hearing, by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative, that gratuities (in the form of entertainment, gifts, or otherwise) were quoteed or given by the Contractor, or any agent, or representative of the Contractor, to any officer or employees of the Government or the NAFI with a view toward securing favorable treatment with respect to the awarding or amending, or the making of any determinations with respect to the performing of such contract.<br />b. In the event this contract is terminated as provided in paragraph "a" hereof, the NAFI shall be entitled (i) to pursue the same remedies against the Contractor as it could pursue in the event of a breach of contract by the Contractor, and (ii) as a penalty in addition to any other damages to which it may be entitled by law, to exemplary damages in an amount (as determined by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative) which shall be not less than three nor more than ten times the cost incurred by the Contractor in providing any such gratuities to any such officer or employee.<br />c. The rights and remedies of the NAFI provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.<br />7. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE (JAN 2005) - The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.<br />8. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT (JAN 2005) - Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract.<br />9. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE (JAN 2005)<br />a. (1) The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to- <br />(i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension;<br />(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below);or<br />(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below).<br />(2) The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.<br />b. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the<br />Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.<br />c. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.<br />d. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any<br />(1) completed supplies, and<br />(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.<br />e. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.<br />f. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.<br />g. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.<br />10. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE (Nov 2011) - Inspection and acceptance will be at destination, unless otherwise provided in this contract. Notwithstanding the requirements for any NAFI inspection and test contained in specifications applicable to this contract, except where specialized inspections or tests are specified for performance solely by the NAFI, the Contractor, shall perform or have performed the inspections and tests required to substantiate that the supplies provided under the contract conform to the drawings, specifications, and contract requirements listed herein, including if applicable the technical requirements for the manufacturers' part numbers specified herein. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. Acceptance of the supplies or services or a written notice of rejections must be accomplished on or before the third working day following delivery of the supplies or services, unless otherwise specified in this contract.<br />11. PAYMENTS (JAN 2005) - Partial payments will be made when deliveries are authorized or as approved by the Contracting Officer. Payments and penalties for late payments are subject to the requirements established by the<br />Prompt Payment Act, as amended, and as implemented for NAFI's. If the NAFI makes payment but such payment fails to include a prompt payment penalty due to the Contractor within 10 days from when the contract payment is made, penalty amounts will not be paid unless the Contractor makes a written request within forty days after the date of payment.<br />Modified as of 9 Dec 2011<br />12. HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS (JAN 2005) - The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof. Contractor further agrees to hold the NAFI harmless from all claims or judgments for damages resulting from the use of products or services listed in this contract, except for such claims or damages caused by, or resulting from negligence of NAFI customers, employees, agents, or representatives. Also, Contractor shall at all times hold and save harmless the NAFI, its agents, representatives, and employees from any and all suits, claims, charges, and expenses which arise out of acts or omissions of Contractor, its agents, representatives, or employees.<br />13. MODIFICATIONS (JAN 2005) - No agreement or understanding to modify this contract will be binding upon the NAFI unless made in writing and signed by a Contracting Officer from the office that issued the contract or its successor.<br />14. COMMERCIAL WARRANTY (JAN 2005) - The Contractor agrees that the supplies or services furnished under this contract shall be covered by the most favorable commercial warranties the Contractor gives to any customer for such supplies or services and that the rights and remedies provided herein are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the NAFI by any other clause of this contract. The printed terms and conditions of such warranty will be provided to the NAFI with the delivery of any supplies covered.<br />Modified as of 9 Dec 2011<br />15. ADVERTISEMENTS (JAN 2005) - Contractor agrees that none of its nor its agent's advertisements, to include publications, merchandise, promotions, coupons, sweepstakes, contest, sales brochures, etc., shall state, infer or imply that the Contractor's products or services are approved, promoted, or endorsed by the NAFI. Any advertisement, including cents-off coupons, which refers to a NAFI will contain a statement that the advertisement is neither paid for, nor sponsored in whole or in part by, the particular activity.<br />16. DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT (JAN 2005)<br />a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of quotes. However, any quoteed discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the quote by the quoter. As an alternative to quoteing a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the quote, quoters awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices.<br />b. In connection with any discount quoteed for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day.<br />17. INVOICES (JAN 2005):<br />a. An invoice is a written request for payment under the contract for supplies delivered or for services rendered. In order to be proper, an invoice should include (and in order to support the payment of interest penalties, must include) the following:<br />(i) Invoice date;<br />(ii) Name of Contractor;<br />(iii) Contract number (including order number, if any), contract line item number, contract description of supplies or services, quantity, contract unit of measure and unit price, and extended total;<br />(iv) Shipment number and date of shipment (Bill of Lading number and weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government Bills of Lading);<br />(v) Name and address to which payment is to be sent (which must be the same as that in the contract or on a proper notice of assignment);<br />(vi) Name (where practicable), title, phone number and mailing address of person to be notified in event of a defective invoice; and<br />(vii) Any other information or documentation required by other provisions of the contract (such as evidence of shipment). Invoices shall be prepared and submitted in duplicate (one copy shall be marked "Original") unless otherwise specified.<br />b. For purposes of determining if interest begins to accrue under the PROMPT PAYMENT ACT (PUBLIC LAW 97-177):<br />(i) A proper invoice will be deemed to have been received when it is received by the office designated in the contract for receipt of invoices and acceptance of the supplies delivered or services rendered has occurred.<br />(ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated.<br />(iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 20") quoteed by the contractor will not be deemed Required payment dates.<br />(iv) The following periods of time will not be included:<br />(A) After receipt of improper invoice and prior to notice of any defect or impropriety, but not to exceed three days for meat and meat food products, five days for perishable agricultural commodities, and 15 days in all other cases, and<br />(B) Between the date of a notice of any defect or impropriety and the date a proper invoice is received.

NON WAIVER OF DEFAULTS (JAN 2005) - Any failure by the NAFI at any time, or from time to time, to enforce or require strict performance of any terms or conditions of this contract will not constitute waiver thereof and will not affect or impair such terms or conditions in any way or the NAFI's right at any time to avail itself of such remedies as it may have for any breach or breaches of such terms and conditions.<br />21. 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity <br />22. 52.222-3 Convict Labor <br />23. 252.225-7002 Qualifying Country Sources as Subcontractors <br />24. 252.203-7001 Prohibition on Persons Convicted of Fraud or Other Defense-Contract Felonies <br />25. 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities 26. 52.223-3 Hazardous Material Identification &amp; Material Safety</p>

<DESC>***Updated 03/16/2015 to include the response to a question received by the due date and time of Thursday, March 12, 2015, 12:00 Noon EST. The response is included as an attachment***
<p><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6 and procedures in Subpart 13.1 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only Request for Quote (RFQ); quotations are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>This solicitation is being issued In Accordance With (IAW) FAR Subpart 13.104. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the RFQ respondent who is deemed responsible and is determined, based on the evaluation factors, to represent the best value to the Government.</p>
<p><br />This procurement is a 100 percent Small Business Set-Aside with a small business size standard of $15M annual sales under NAICS Code 541690. Award is limited to U.S. Firms or U.S. individuals. Contractor and subcontractor personnel used shall be either U.S. citizens on non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States. Contractor use of subcontractors is limited to less than fifty percent of the proposed price.</p>
<p><br />USTDA is seeking the expertise of a third-party, transportation sector specialist ("DM contractor") to identify, evaluate and recommend projects in Indonesia's transportation sector for USTDA funding consideration. The projects recommended by the DM Contractor should help to promote U.S. private sector objectives as well as the development of transportation infrastructure priorities in Indonesia.</p>
<p><br />The DM contractor would examine and assess projects to improve Indonesia's domestic and intra-regional transportation infrastructure. The DM contractor shall evaluate projects which will enhance Indonesia's air traffic management, airport infrastructure, airport and aviation safety, and air navigation systems and determine their eligibility for USTDA funding. Further, the DM contractor will assess potential projects in the rail sub-sectors, focusing on areas where U.S. companies have demonstrated a competitive advantage such as locomotives and signaling technologies. In addition, the DM contractor shall assess the strength of potential projects in port infrastructure, port management, and port security and would recommend any such projects for USTDA funding consideration if the proposed project meets USTDA funding criteria.</p>
<p><br />PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THE RFQ AND STATEMENT OF WORK AND FOLLOW ALL THE INSTRUCTIONS ACCORDINGLY.</p>

<DESC>03/16/15 Update:  <br> The solicitation that was posted on 03/13/15 is only applicable to the most highly qualified firm. If your firm was not notified that it is the most highly qualified, do not respond to this solicitaiton.  <br>  <br> 11/13/14 Changes:  <br>  The valuse of the procurement has been increased from $8,250,000 to $10,000,000. The format has also been changed from a base year plus four option years and a 6 month option to extend to a five year contract with a 6 month option to extend. Questions 6. and 7. are as follows.    <br>  Q&A  <br>    <br>  6.	Please describe the water and sewer systems. Also, please provide any studies completed recently on the two systems.  <br>  a.	The water and sewer systems are municipal type systems.  The water systems  <br>  include a water plant, water treatment, wells, reservoirs, distribution  <br>  piping etc..  The sewer system includes a Waste Water Treatment Plant,  <br>  gravity sewer lines, forced mains and lift stations etc..  <br>    <br>  There have been several studies of these systems over the past few years.  <br>  We will not release any of the studies or detail information on these  <br>   systems until after award and when a task order would be issued that would require this information.  <br>    <br>  7.	We have found with many A/E solicitations, that the requirement for Fire Protection Engineer includes either a) a BS or MS in fire protection engineering from an accredited institution, b) PE registration in a related, relevant field or c) NCEES fire protection examination; each with a minimum of five years of experience, with all current nationally-recognized codes, such as National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) [with emphasis in NFPA 101 Life Safety and DOD Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC 3-600- 01)], and with at least two years of experience in the design of sprinkler and High Expansion Foam fire protection systems.  Will one of these three means of meeting the Fire Protection Engineer requirement be satisfactory?  <br>    <br>  a.	Any of these three are acceptable.   <br>    <br>  10/29/14 Changes;   <br>         Q&A   <br>      <br>   3.In reviewing the solicitation noted above, near the end of the  quote mark SUBMISSION FORMAT quote mark  paragraph, we see a requirement that 50% of the labor be performed by personnel of the prime contractor.  We're used to seeing such a requirement on small-business set-aside solicitations, but not on full and open ones.  With the wide variety of work and specialized services under the solicitation, it would be difficult for otherwise-qualified firms which don't offer full services in-house to meet this requirement.  Is there any possibility that requirement will be waived?   <br>      <br>    quote mark It is the responsibility of the Prime Contractor to comply with FAR 52.219-14. At least 50% of the cost of the contract performance incurred for personnel must be expended for employees of the prime firm. The 50% self-performing requirement will be based on the contract as a whole. quote mark  has been removed from the notice and is no longer required.    <br>      <br>   4.Does Fort McCoy have any companies under contract for geotechnical engineering or for soil borings?    <br>      <br>   Our current A-E contract with Rani Engineering, W911SA-12-D-0001    <br>       <br>   5.Regarding subject Solicitation for A-E Services to support Fort McCoy, and specifically Factor 1 (Professional Qualifications), does the Government wish to review resume(s) for personnel to show performance capabilities in NEPA and other Environmental Services in addition to the eleven resumes specified? In Factor 2 (Specialized Experience and Technical Competence) the first of five listed performance areas includes technical competencies that biologists/environmental scientists typically provide. We respectfully request guidance on how the Source Selection Evaluation Board wishes to evaluate Professional Qualifications and Specialized Experience, and we recommend requiring a twelfth resume for Environmental Scientist.   <br>      <br>   Another resume, (12) Environmental Scientist, will be added as a requirement for FACTOR (1)-Professional Qualifications.    <br>      <br>   10/23/14 Changes:      <br>         1. Added  quote mark Large Businesses must comply with FAR 52.219-9, FAR 19.704, DFARS 219.704, and AFARS 5119.704-regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan. The small business subcontracting plan is NOT required as part of this submittal.

<CONTACT> Vanessa D. Fox, Phone  2027070405, Email vfox@loc.gov
<DESC>The Library of Congress/FEDLINK will issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) # LC15QFP007-MCVL&nbsp;to procure a library services management system to meet the needs of the Library of the Marine Corps (LoMC) in fulfilling its mission of supporting study and research throughout the Marine Corps in a joint and combined environment by providing comprehensive storage, retrieval, analysis, and distribution of warfighting-related information.
<p>The LoMC provides worldwide access to an extensive collection of monographs and journals, historically significant archival documents, products of current scholarly research, and operational planning and lessons learned. The LoMC has four branches:<br />&bull; USMC Research Library: The premier academic library within the Marine Corps. Its collections include over 150,000 volumes, 400 periodical subscriptions, and 120,000 microforms as well as access to numerous government and commercial databases and digital resources. The Library provides a complete range of reference, bibliographic, research and loan services to students, faculty, and staff of the University schools as well as to Marines and independent scholars worldwide.<br />&bull; Quantico Base Library: Provides educational, cultural, technical, informational, and recreational library needs for military personnel and their family members stationed at Quantico, civilian employees of the Base, and retirees living in the local area.<br />&bull; Virtual Library: Provides technical oversight and management of all matters relating to the recommendation, purchase, licensing and use of software applications, leased and/or purchased digital information resources, and the systems used to organize, catalog, and provide access to the library's electronic resources. <br />&bull; Marine Corps Archives &amp; Special Collections: Collects, maintains and provides access record copies of Marine Corps Unit Command Chronologies, Command Historical Summary Files as well as non-record copies of valuable Marine Corps operational and administrative records, = USMC official publications, oral histories, curriculum files, photos, and videos in a variety of digital and non-digital formats.</p>
<p>Because the current library services system is nearing the end of its lifecycle, the LoMC has made the decision to procure a replacement system. The LoMC seeks an economical, next generation, web-based library services management system hosted in a secure cloud environment. The LoMC intends to take advantage of newer technology platforms that simplify workflows by maintaining a resource sharing cooperative knowledgebase, allowing the LoMC to maintain its holdings in a collective worldwide library database without duplication or creation of local catalog records.</p>
<p>The new system must provide:<br />&bull; Circulation, cataloging , acquisitions, serials control, collection analytics, and reporting functionality<br />&bull; Complete integration for discovery and access, as well as licensing management and control of LoMC subscription databases and ebooks, including but not limited to resources from vendors such as ProQuest, Ebsco, Jane's Defense, LexisNexis and others<br />&bull; Seamless integration with LoMC OCLC subscription services including WorldCat Desktop cataloging, Worldshare InterLibrary Loan, and EZProxy remote authentication tool<br />&bull; Embedded discovery tools providing immediate access to both print and electronic resources via a comprehensive knowledgebase<br />&bull; Streamlined workflows without duplicative or otherwise redundant work<br />Other requirements:<br />&bull; Mobile interface<br />&bull; ISO 27001 certification (certification confirmed via annual 3rd party audit) as well as a demonstrated intention to extend to Federal Risk and Authorization Management (FedRAMP) compliance<br />&bull; Data migration<br />&bull; On-site consultation and training</p>
<p>Ref: LC15QFP007-MCVL.</p>
<p>FEDLINK is a nationwide interagency consortium sponsored by the Library of Congress. The contract will be awarded in accordance with the Library of Congress Fiscal Operations Improvement Act, P.L. 106-481, Section 103 (2 U.S.C. &sect; 182c.).</p>
<p>For further information on the Library of Congress FEDLINK program, please visit our website at: http://www.loc.gov/flicc. For information about becoming a FEDLINK vendor, please contact James Oliver, Vendor Services Coordinator, on (202) 707-4960 or email joli@loc.gov.</p>

NOTE:  Offerors are NOT to contact these facilities in any manner  the addresses are being provided for proposal preparation only**

Certain facilities are supported by Valve Regulated Acid (VRLA) battery strings while other facilities are supported by Valve Lead Acid (VLA) units.  

The contractor must perform battery site visits and attend pre-installation meetings, supply and deliver the battery strings and individual batteries, remove and dispose of existing battery strings and individual batteries, install new battery strings and individual batteries, reinstall the existing battery monitoring systems and test the replacement battery strings and individual batteries with the Uninterruptible Power Module (UPM).

This is a Small Business set-aside.  The principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code applicable to this effort is 335911 Storage Battery Manufacturing with the size standard of 500 employees.

The resulting award will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP/IDIQ) with a period of performance of a two-year base period and six one-year option periods.  The base period is anticipated to begin April 1, 2015.

<DESC>Special Notice 

The purpose of this announcement is to provide notification of an upcoming vendor demonstration opportunity for potential UAS utilization on wildland fire missions.  

The United States Department of the Interior (DOI), Office of Aviation Services (OAS), seeks companies interested in demonstrating runway independent unmanned aircraft systems for the purposes of monitoring and mapping wildland fires.  The dates, times, and locations will be formalized in the coming months and coordinated with interested parties.  The likely locations for these demonstrations will be in the Western U.S. and possibly Alaska. The purpose of these demonstrations is to assess the suitability of utilizing these types of aircraft for a variety of missions, including, but not limited to reconnaissance and data gathering during all times of day/night and during IFR conditions. We are asking for an initial response of capable companies interested in demonstrating these types of aircraft. To participate in this demonstration, the company owned and operated aircraft will be asked to meet the minimum specifications, (See Attached):

Operations will be conducted under DOI/USFS COA or Emergency COA.	

The demonstration will take place in high desert and mountainous terrain and over active or recently active wildland fires.

DOI/OAS asks all interested parties to submit a short informational paper to include but not limited to; aircraft description and specifications, photos, relevant expertise, and performance information confirming the ability of your aircraft and pilots to perform the scenario based missions listed above. The following information must also be submitted:

Company Name
Primary Point of Contact Name
Phone Number
Email Address
Business Size (Small or Large-NAICS 336411)

Submissions should be sent to michael_willis@ibc.doi.gov and must be provided by March 30, 2015.

This announcement is for information planning purposes only and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any actual procurement of supplies or services. This is not a request for proposal, request for quotation, or invitation for bid, nor does its issuance obligate or restrict the Government to an acquisition approach. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of any responses or pay for the preparation of any information submitted or use of such information. 

Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any costs incurred for attendance to the demonstration.  Attendees must make their own travel and lodging arrangements.   Vendors will be asked to review and sign a vendor demonstration agreement prior to attendance. 

Questions concerning this special notice will only be accepted via email addressed to the Contracting Officer, Michael Willis at michael_willis@ibc.doi.gov.

<DESC>The following answers are to questions received.<br /><br />&nbsp;
<p>You asked: After reading the Sources Sought, we cannot exactly understand what</p>
<p>the sources are and what exactly we need to do?</p>
<p>Reply: The product sought is a geospatial mapping database. It should include</p>
<p>imagery, streets maps, topographic maps, etc. Seamless and immediate</p>
<p>integration with Esri ArcGIS for Server software is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this primarily an IT project?</p>
<p>Reply: This is a request for a product, not a service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you looking to find different software than ESRI that you have mentioned</p>
<p>in this note(Data Appliance and World Places Locator ESRI products)?</p>
<p>Reply: Yes, this is a review of alternatives to Esri imagery, but integration</p>
<p>with Esri ArcGIS for Server software is required. Currently, the only known</p>
<p>supplier is Esri.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The pre-proposal conference will be a site visit to the animal care facility held for the purpose of providing information concerning the Government's requirements which may be helpful in the preparation of proposals and for answering any questions which you have regarding this requirement.</p>
<p>The pre-proposal conference will consist of an initial pre-facility meeting taking place promptly at 10:00am that will provide an overview of the acquisition and will be immediately followed by the facility walk-through. Anyone that has been in a different animal facility within 24 hours of the pre-proposal conference will not be allowed into the facility or the facility walk-through. Anyone arriving past the beginning of the pre-facility meeting will not be allowed into the facility. Attendees will not be reimbursed for any cost of attending the site visit.

<p>The success of this type of conference depends largely on the lead-time available to the Government for research in connection with questions submitted by offerors. Therefore, you are encouraged to submit questions via email to the Contract Specialist no later than three days prior to the pre-proposal conference (i.e. March 17 at 4:30pm Eastern) as it relates to information concerning the facility walk-through site visit. Offerors should note that their questions may not be answered at the conference. Only generic questions will be answered during the pre-proposal conference and facility walk-through.</p>
<p>Because of space limitations, each prospective offeror shall be limited to a total of 2 representatives at the Pre-Proposal conference.</p>
<p>Attendance at the pre-proposal conference is recommended; however, attendance is not a prerequisite for proposal submission and will not be considered a factor in proposal evaluation.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:<br />Contractor services will include genotyping services, attending ACUC Veterinarian representation, and cryopreservation services as detailed in the attached work statement draft. Additional services include animal husbandry for rodents, rabbits, guinea pigs, non-human primates and other species; research technical support; breeding novel genetic models; routine maintenance of animal care equipment; logistical and clerical support; and other specialized services required as new animal study proposals (ASP) are introduced by IRP investigators.</p>
<p>The major evaluation factors for this solicitation include technical (which encompasses experience and past performance factors), and cost/price factors. Specifically, proposals will be evaluated against three technical criteria: Technical Approach, 45%, Corporate Capability, 35%, and Corporate Experience, 20%. Offerors are required to submit an acceptable Small Business Subcontracting Plan with their business proposal. Past Performance will be an evaluatable criterion after determination of a competitive range is established.</p>
<p>Offerors shall refer to the solicitation for submission instructions.</p>
<p>The Comparative Medicine Section (CMS), under the NIA Office of the Scientific Director (OSD), provides oversight for the overall program of laboratory animal housing, care, and management to ensure compliance with the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR) Guide, as interpreted by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), NIH Policy, and the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International (AAALACi).</p>
<p>The Government anticipates making one award for a cost-reimbursement type of contract for a period of one base year and four optional periods of performance. The base period shall be effective September 1, 2015 through August 31, 2016 with the option to exercise an additional four option year periods of performance subsequently.</p>
<p>This acquisition is a follow on requirement that will be recompeted for the similar requirement awarded under prior contract HHSN271201000009C to Charles River Laboratories, Inc. on March 1, 2010 for a period of five years.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) on or about March 11, 2015 and proposals will be tentatively due about 50 days after the solicitation release date.</p>
<p>Potential offerors may request a copy of the solicitation from the Contract Specialist, Hunter Tjugum, electronically at hunter.tjugum@nih.gov. Please reference the solicitation number HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-PSOL-2015-073 on your electronic request.</p>

<DESC><p>I. SUMMARY<br />This announcement constitutes a sources sought notice for planning purposes (FAR 15.201(e)). This is NOT a Request for Proposals. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS EXIST AT THIS TIME. This sources sought notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quote (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice.</p>
<p>The potential for mid air collision is a hazard present in all modern aircraft operations. Military operations in particular present an added challenge due to the scenarios and electromagnetic environments in which military aircraft operate. To mitigate the gap in military Mid Air Collision Avoidance Capability (MCAC), the Collision Avoidance Solutions (CAS) Integrated Product Team (IPT), the Program Manager for Air Combat Electronics (PMA209), and the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Program Management Acquisition Executive (AIR-1.0) initiated a program for MCAC. This team is evaluating the performance, operational capability, and costs of fielding a system to meet current requirements as defined in the Aircraft Survivability (AS) Initial Capabilities Document (ICD), OPNAV Instruction 13210.1B (Naval Aviation Policy for Aircraft Avionics Safety Systems) and other pertinent documents identified for collision avoidance capability.</p>
<p>The information received will be used to evaluate MCAC across three basic encounter scenarios while operating in the three basic electromagnetic environments described in Enclosure 1. The identified encounter scenarios are: intruder, rendezvous, and formation. The emission environments are: non-tactical (emissions unrestricted), tactical (restricted/encrypted emissions only), and stealth (no emissions permitted/EMCON). MCAC must operate in all environmental conditions that the host aircraft are capable of operating within. Threat vulnerabilities and potential effects from jamming will also be considered. Initial Operating Capability (IOC) of (no later than) FY-23 is currently planned, but mature alternatives could allow for an earlier IOC date.</p>
<p>An MCAC system has been recognized to consist of three, essentially independent subsystems: sensor(s), a computational mechanism (computer), and a Pilot/Vehicle Interface (PVI) capable of displaying traffic and annunciating an alert to the pilot(s). Thus, a single computational system may be capable of computing a traffic conflict based on inputs from different sensors designed for different electromagnetic environments. Likewise, the computational mechanism may be present as an algorithm resident in an existing aircraft computer system or as its own independent unit. Subsystems that provide overlapping functionality across scenarios are sought for a synergistic overlap of capabilities in an integrated system.</p>
<p>The purpose of an MCAC system is to alert the ownship pilot(s) of other aircraft (i.e. "traffic") that pose an air-to-air collision threat. To accomplish this, MCAC is expected to use aural/visual and optionally tactile alerts to notify the aircrew of conflicting traffic and potential collisions. The primary goal is to reduce preventable accidents involving loss of life or injury while preserving valuable aircraft assets. The secondary goal is to provide Situational Awareness (SA) of surrounding aircraft to the ownship pilot(s). To accomplish this, MCAC will first need to sense traffic (i.e. have inputs from sensors), then track nearby aircraft by computing their expected trajectories to evaluate the potential for a mid air collision, ultimately responding to the situation by presenting information and alerts to pilots when appropriate. The system needs to interface with aircraft Warning, Caution, Advisory (WCA) systems to present to pilots (1) a sense of urgency of the situation, (2) unambiguous situation information, and (3) be intelligible over other aircraft cockpit conditions. The presentation of information must not interfere with the operation of the aircraft and must not inappropriately distract pilots, e.g., unnecessary alerts, startling warnings or directives. The system should be capable of presenting recommendations for appropriate pilot action in anticipation of decision-aiding technology being available.</p>
<p>NAVAIR previously conducted an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) under RFI (Solicitation # 41011GW2 dated 25 April 2013). The conclusion of the AoA indicated that no single technical solution "met all requirements for performing mid air collision avoidance in all scenarios and environments..." The analysis revealed that the nature of the encounter scenarios versus the required electromagnetic environments required material solutions sufficiently divergent from one another as to be categorized as different systems.</p>
<p>The result was a decision to field the solution in partial increments based upon best return on investment (ROI) from among the scenario/environment permutations. The purpose of this sources sought notice is to collect information of any ongoing research/technologies and existing programs that may assist in determining the most prudent alternative(s) in the initial increment of MCAC and plan for the most affordable and effective alternatives for increased protection in future increment(s). The first increment of MCAC is anticipated to include the intruder scenario in the non-tactical and tactical electromagnetic environments, similar (but not identical) in performance to the existing commercial Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). Potential solutions to the other seven permutations are also sought for planning for future increments, especially the identification of overlaps.</p>
<p>The initial four naval (i.e., USN and USMC) aviation platforms planned for the first increment of MCAC are the AH-1Z, UH-1Y, MH-60R and MH-60S helicopters. Applicability of alternatives for use in other naval aviation platforms will also be considered.</p>
<p><br />II. SOURCES SOUGHT ENCLOSURES - the following enclosures are attached:</p>
<p>1. PRIORITIES, DEFINITIONS, EXPLANATIONS, AND REQUIREMENTS<br />2. SYSTEM METRICS</p>

<DESC><p><br /><br />This is Request for Proposals No. 15-100-SOL-00014.<br /><br /><br />Prevention of disease caused by seasonal and novel influenza strains of pandemic potential continues to be a public health challenge. Vaccination is the primary medical intervention for prevention of infection with these viruses. Seasonal influenza vaccines, which are produced and administered annually, are only 30% to 70% effective. Excess morbidity and mortality caused by seasonal influenza virus disease can be devastating in terms of years of life lost and economic productivity. The emergence of novel strains of influenza viruses presents a public health threat, with potential rapid global spread among people with no pre-existing immunity to the virus, causing catastrophic morbidity and mortality.</p>
<p><br />The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), is launching a new initiative supporting the advanced development of influenza vaccine candidates with the goal to provide enhanced, long-lasting protection from a broad range of antigenically divergent influenza viruses within and across subtypes. These new vaccines will be more effective than current vaccines in providing protection from influenza infection in people of all ages and in people generally considered high-risk for severe disease associated with influenza infection. Additionally, these new vaccines may serve as a priming dose during non-pandemic periods to enable a single dose of a pandemic influenza vaccine to be effective. As such, promising experimental data providing evidence that the new vaccine may serve as a primer for a pandemic influenza vaccine booster will be evaluated favorably. Offerors are required to develop these vaccine candidates towards final FDA licensure for prophylaxis against disease caused by seasonal and pandemic influenza.</p>
<p><br />HHS/ASPR/Acquisition Management, Contracts and Grants (AMCG) is publishing a Request for Proposals (RFP) to support the advanced development of new influenza vaccines that are more effective than currently licensed vaccines as a step towards development of a universal influenza vaccine with potential prime- boost vaccine properties for pandemic influenza. This RFP provides additional details regarding the desired characteristics for the development towards a universal influenza vaccine candidate through a defined target product profile (TPP). BARDA contemplates a single or multiple contract award(s) to develop, manufacture, and evaluate more effective influenza vaccine candidate(s) toward US licensure.</p>
<p><br />Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. This notice does not commit the Government to the award of a contract. It is the Offeror's responsibility to monitor this website (www.fbo.gov) for the release of any subsequent amendments to the solicitation. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments via www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p><br />All inquiries concerning this requirement must be identified with the RFP number, name of firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, email address and must be submitted to the primary and/or secondary point of contact identified in this notice.</p>

<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

<AWARDEE>COUNTY OF DADE (949080733)  <br>  201 E WATER ST <br>  GREENFIELD, MO 65661
<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because the procurement is awarded to a sole source under the Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (FAR 13.5). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> SINGLE SOURCE DETERMINATION <br>  <br> 1. CONTRACTING AGENCY: Kansas City District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Contracting Division, 601 E. 12th St., Kansas City, MO 64106. <br>  <br> 2. DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: A new, singles source, firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract using non-expiring Civil Operations and Maintenance (O&M Civil, No Year) appropriations to acquire and fund law enforcement services for Stockton Lake Project. The period of performance for the contract in Stockton, Missouri will not exceed two (2) years, with a base year and a maximum of one option year; the appropriation will support the option period. <br>  <br> 3. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE: Law enforcement services including patrolling the area at specified times, upholding the law, and arresting law breakers for the Stockton Lake Project. Services will be obtained from the following law enforcement agency, under the Solicitaiton numbers listed below: <br>  <br>   Dade County Sheriff (Stockton Lake Project) <br> 201 W Water St <br> Greenfield, MO 65661 <br> W912DQ-15-R-1008 <br>  <br> Period of Performance and estimate details: <br>   Dade County - Base plus one option year ( 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016 for the base, with the option period ending 31 March 2017); estimate of $48,500 per year for a total of $97,000; <br>  <br> 4. AUTHORITY CITED: FAR 13.106-1(b), Soliciting from a single source. <br>  <br> 5. REASON FOR AUTHORITY CITED: <br> a. BACKGROUND: The NWK Lake Projects require increased seasonal law enforcement services on U.S. Government owned lands within its jurisdiction. Historically, these law enforcement services have been provided by a contract with the local Sheriffs' departments. The predecessor contract for this action is: Dade County MO - W912DQ-13-C-0054. The contract costs consist of labor for Sheriff's personnel, vehicle patrols, dispatch services, and administration services. The County Sheriff's Departments shall enforce all applicable Federal, state, county, civil, and criminal laws excluding those contained in Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter III, nor shall they be empowered to enforce such regulations. The minimum requirements of these services are that the contractor be able to patrol the area at specified times, be able to uphold the law, arrest law breakers and prosecute within the counties, and be able to respond to an emergency in a timely manner. <br>  <br> b. JUSTIFICATION: <br> 1. Statutory authority to contract with the County Sheriff's Departments is required by state statutes. <br> 2. The following are facts: <br> i. 42 U.S. Code   1962d-5d - Authorization of Secretary of the Army to contract with States and political subdivisions for increased law enforcement services during peak visitation periods; authorization of appropriations - <br> (a)The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, is authorized to contract with States and their political subdivisions for the purpose of obtaining increased law enforcement services at water resources development projects <br> under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Army to meet needs during peak visitation periods. <br> (b)There is authorized to be appropriated $10,000,000 per fiscal year for each fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1986, to carry out this section. <br> ii. Missouri State Statute, Chapter 57, Section 109 states, <br> 1. Every sheriff shall have the power to contract with the Secretary of the Army of the United States, acting through the Corps of Engineers, for the purpose of providing increased law enforcement services at or near water resources development projects, active or inactive, under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Army which are located within the county of the contracting sheriff. <br>  <br> 2. No such contracts shall be for a period of more than two years. <br> iii. All previous contracts for the NKW Lake Projects are with the County Sheriff's Departments listed above. <br> iv. The contractor will be required to submit a quote for these services and the price reasonableness will be determined by the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer will also verify that the Department of Labor wage determinations are enforced for this contract. <br> v. There is no competition anticipated for this procurement because there is only one (1) Sheriff per county. <br>  <br> 3. Alternatives: Since by statute there is little competition, the only real alternative might be to award a contract to the State Highway Patrol. However, the local law enforcement has been more efficient in responding faster to emergencies at the Lake Project. In the past, when the Lake Projects have had to rely on the State Highway Patrol for an emergency, they have been slow in their responsiveness or were unable to support the Lake Project because they were busy with another issue (e.g. highway-type issues).
