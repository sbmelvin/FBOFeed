<DESC><p>The Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a non-competitive order for the below mentioned items to Unanet Technologies. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. A Request for Proposal is not available. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>&bull; User licenses plus prorated maintenance for Unanet Project Portfolio - quantity 125</p>
<p>The IHS Office of Information Technology (OIT) has adopted the Unanet Project Portfolio product for tracking of all project activity within the three OIT Investments. The original selection of Unanet was competed in 2009, and deployment of the initial 75 licenses was limited to a subset of contract staff on the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) Investment. Utilization was expanded in FY2010 to cover the remainder of RPMS including Federal staff, and the current purchase will complete the deployment to all federal and contract staff working on all OIT Investments.

All Specifications will be in the solicitation

Electronic Responses are not accepted.

This rental will support Lifting and Handling Department at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in support of maintenance of facilities, utilities, dry-dock repairs, and submarine work.

The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has determined it necessary, for safety, readiness and financial reasons to standardize the training for aerial manlifts.
  Because of the significant costs of training and the importance of safety & operational features, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard is limiting the types of models for the purpose of standardization and familiarity with equipment.  The specific lifts cited are those that the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard currently has an approved lesson plan and licensing procedure. 

To rent any other manufacturers lifts for use at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard would add additional labor costs and time, which would cause unnecessary delays in Lifting and Handling Departments mission of support to the Shipyard.

<DESC>The Naval Inventory Control Point (NAVICP) is contemplating the award of a Firm Fixed Priced contract for the repair of 125 units of NSN: 7RE 2995 013091925, P/N: 53WK16012. Complete data, drawings and the rights to the same are not available from the Government.  
 These items require Government Source Approval prior to award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items has been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.
 If you are not an approved source, you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVICP Source Approval Brochure which can be obtained on the internet at https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navicp/business_opps. 
Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the source approval brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of this requirement may be continued based on Fleet support needs.
All contractual documents (i.e.
 contracts, purchase orders, task orders, delivery orders and modifications) related to the instant procurement are considered to be "issued" by the Government when copies are either deposited in the mail, transmitted by facsimile, or sent by other electronic commerce methods, such as email. The Governments acceptance of the contractors proposal constitutes bilateral agreement to "issue" contractual documents as detailed herein.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: The information within this notice is based on the best and most current information available to date. This information is subject to change and does not bind the Government in anyway. Updated information will be provided in a subsequent notice or synopsis, if and when necessary.<BR><BR>COMPLETENESS:  When the Government solicits for jacks it is the intent and requirement of the Government to acquire completely assembled and readily usable jacks.  It is the bidder's or contractor's responsibility to bring to the attention of the Government's Contracting Officer such incompatibilities or omissions of equipment that would seem incongruous or prevent the jacks from being fully functional when received by the end user.  It is permissible to ship the jacks with the pump handles detached and packed in the same container as the jacks to reduce the volume of the shipping containers.  Jack handles shall be packed in the same container with the jacks they will be attached to and not be packed separately.  <BR><BR>DESIGN:   The jacks offered to the government shall meet all of the requirements of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Safety Standard for Portable Automotive Lifting Devices, PALD 2009 Part 7, entitled "Service Jacks" and all further requirements set forth in this specification.  In the event of a perceived conflict between the PALD standard and this requirement, this requirement shall take precedence.   (Jacks offered from different manufacturers and suppliers may have varying design characteristics such as two speed pumping mechanisms, single speed pumping mechanisms with foot pedals for rapid rise of the saddle to contact the load, air over hydraulic systems or any combination of the above.  Any offered design may be considered for acceptance based upon its demonstrated ability to meet all of the other requirements in this document.) <BR><BR>PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:  The following product requirements are in addition to those that are required by ANSI/ASME PALD Part 7.  <BR><BR>CHASSIS LENGTH:  The full length of the chassis shall be not less than 47 inches, excluding the handle.<BR><BR>LIFTING DISTANCE:  The 4-ton jack shall be capable of lifting the full rated load from its lowest position, at no higher than 5   inches (the saddle must be able to slide under an object where the clearance is no more than 5  inches), to its highest position, at no lower than 21 inches.<BR>                               <BR>FORCE ON HANDLE:  The 4-ton load shall be lifted from the lowest position to the highest position with no more than 160 pounds of force applied at the "T" on the handle.<BR><BR>HANDLE DESIGN:  The pump handle shall be no more than 54 inches long from the pivot point to the "T" on the end of the handle.  A "T" on the handle is required.<BR><BR>HYDRAULIC FLUID:  Only hydraulic fluids that produce no adverse effects on health and for which no special precautions are required beyond attention to good personal hygiene such as washing with soap and water shall be used.  Two copies of a Material Safety Data Sheet for the hydraulic fluid shall be packed with the owner's manual for each jack.  The fluid used in the jack shall be a general purpose hydraulic fluid of ISO Viscosity grade 32 with anti-wear, oxidation resistance, a pour point at or below -40F and rust and corrosion protection.  The hydraulic fluids and seals shall be compatible with each other.  Example fluids may be Mobil DTE 13 M, Shell Tellus T 32, Texaco Rando HDZ 32, Exxon Univis N 32, and Chevron Rykon Premium Oil 32.  This list is not meant to be all-inclusive but is offered to help clarify the requirement by example.   Fluids conforming to MIL-DTL-17111 will be acceptable as well. Aircraft grade fluids and fire retardant fluids are not required.  <BR><BR>HYDRAULIC FLUID LABELING:  The following message shall be applied in a permanent manner with large plain type near the filler plug(s) of the hydraulic fluid reservoir in such a position that it will be seen by anyone attempting to refill the reservoir.  The type shall either be dark on a light background or light on a dark background.  Fill in the name and type of hydraulic fluid that is used in the jack.<BR><BR>CAUTION<BR>USE NO OTHER FLUID THAN<BR>(Fill in your fluid identification here)<BR> <BR>OVERLOAD BYPASS VALVE:  The jack shall incorporate a hydraulically activated overload protection system which is separate in design and operation from the load release system, is not externally adjustable by the user and which is located in the pump side of the hydraulic circuit such that it shall bypass hydraulic fluid from the pump to the reservoir when experiencing an overload on the saddle.  The valve shall be adjusted to operate at a load between 100% of the jack's rated load and 125% of the jack's rated load.  Since it is necessary to fill the reservoir with hydraulic fluid to set the bypass valve, the fluid can remain sealed in the reservoir for shipment. <BR><BR>LOAD RELEASE SYSTEM:  The hydraulic unit shall incorporate a manually activated and controlled hydraulic release system to permit controlled lowering and complete stopping, at any position of the saddle, when the saddle is either fully loaded or completely unloaded, throughout the entire range of saddle travel.  The load release system shall control the saddle's overall rate of descent to one foot per minute or slower throughout the full range of saddle travel, without stopping, while under full rated load.  The release system shall be controlled at the "T" or cross end of the handle.<BR><BR>HYDRAULIC OVER-TRAVEL BYPASS SYSTEM:  The hydraulic system shall incorporate a hydraulic fluid bypass to prevent over-travel of the lifting member after reaching its highest raised position.  Unlimited buildup of hydraulic pressure, after reaching the point of highest rise, will not be acceptable.<BR><BR>MANUALS AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS:  Two sets of Commercial manuals and operating instructions shall be over packed with each jack furnished.  The manuals and instructions shall be written in American English dialect and shall be printed in a clean and legible manner.  The manuals and operating instructions shall include safety, setup, operation, maintenance, and repair information, addresses of dealer/distributors that do repair work, and a list of replaceable parts with part numbers.  The manuals and operating instructions may be in the manufacturer's format and shall include the following information on the front cover. <BR>       <BR>a. The government's National Stock Number 4910-00-516-5806.<BR>b. The nomenclature of the jack.  Use "Jack, Dolly Type, Hydraulic, Automotive Service, 4 Ton".<BR>c. The contract number under which the jack was sold.<BR>d. The manufacturer's name and CAGE CODE.<BR>e. The suppliers name, address and CAGE CODE if different from the manufacturer.<BR><BR>Appropriate Material Safety Data Sheets shall be provided with the manuals and operating instructions.<BR><BR>COPYRIGHT:  The owner of the copyrights shall extend copyrights for the manuals and operating instructions and spare parts lists to the Government and provide a letter to the Government's contracting officer to that effect.<BR>       <BR>ELECTRONIC COPIES OF MANUALS:  The owner of the copyright shall provide an electronic copy of the manuals that are over-packed with the jacks on a CD, in .pdf Adobe Acrobat format to the contracting officer, before the first shipment of the jacks.<BR><BR>RECLAIMED MATERIALS:  The manufacturer may use reclaimed materials for fabricating new parts.  Reclaimed materials shall be reprocessed, remanufactured, or recycled in a manner that restores them to the same chemical composition and physical properties as the virgin materials originally selected for use.  Use of reclaimed parts as is or rebuilt from scrap or other used equipment is not permitted.<BR>       <BR>DISSIMILAR METALS:  Appropriate measures as recommended by MIL-STD-889 shall be taken to prevent galvanic corrosion.<BR>       <BR>SPECIAL MARKINGS:  In addition to all of the marking required elsewhere in this specification, the jack shall also be permanently marked with the following contract data:  <BR>       <BR>a. Full Government contract number<BR>b. Date of manufacture<BR>c. Name and address of manufacturer<BR>d. Point of Contact for warranty matters<BR>        <BR>Any response to this notice should include the following information: delivery schedule (estimated length of time to deliver from award), estimated price per unit, company name, point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, e-mail address, brief description of company and capabilities, experience area, size, history, CAGE Code, large business or small business, category such as 8(a), HUBZone, or any other information that you feel would be pertinent.<BR>NOTE: NO SOLICITATION IS ISSUED AT THIS TIME. SOLICITATION RELEASE IS ANTICIPATED ON OR ABOUT MARCH 1st, 2011. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by the U.S. Government.

<DESC>Headgate Rock Dam, Low Voltage Station Service Switchgear Retrofill
This is a sources sought synopsis for acquisition planning purposes only.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) has a requirement to retrofill the low voltage (480Volts) Station Service Switchgear for the hydro-electric power plant at Headgate Rock Dam, Arizona.  The dam is located approximately one mile north of Parker, Arizona in La Paz County on the Colorado River Indian Reservation and is operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  The Bureau of Reclamation provides engineering and procurement support to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) at Headgate Rock Dam.
Through a retrofil, Reclamation expects to improve the functionality, reliability, and most importantly, the safety of the 480 Volt station service switchgear.  The switchgear has two ABB LKE 1600 electrically operated main circuit breakers.  One of the two main LKE 1600 circuit breakers was replaced with an ABB, RMAX 1600amp, Low Voltage Roll-in circuit breaker.  During testing operations of the RMAX circuit breaker and subsequent re-installation of an LKE 1600, BOR switching guidelines were not followed and cubicle safety devices malfunctioned allowing a closed breaker to be installed resulting in breaker and cubicle damage and flash burn injuries to a Reclamation Electrician.  There exists a real concern about a possible design flaw with the circuit breaker control system and cubicle safety devices and the fact that the re-installation of the LKE 1600 was allowed while it was in the closed position.
Reclamation is seeking current state-of-the-art solutions in circuit breaker technology for the replacement of the circuit breakers and the associated cubicle/cradle hardware in order to increase the safety of racking operations and to mitigate the arc flash hazard.  The contractor will be required to furnish all labor, equipment, materials and incidentals necessary to design, manufacture and install all retrofill components within an allotted outage period.  The contractor will be required to perform a qualified retrofill design for the low voltage switchgear circuit breakers and related components.  The switchgear must be compatible in form, fit and function with the current switchgear and cradles in the Headgate Rock Dam power plant.  Reconditioning of the existing circuit breakers and the existing cubicles/cradles is not acceptable and will not be considered.  Remanufacturing of the existing breakers and cubicles/cradles to "like new" condition is not acceptable and will not be considered.
The proposed contract will be a firm fixed-price construction contract.  This acquisition, when announced will be conducted under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 335313 Switchgear and Switchboard Apparatus Manufacturing.  The small business size standard is for NAICS Code 335313 is 750 employees.  The estimated magnitude of this project is $250,000 to $500,000. 
The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region, is seeking responsible sources having capabilities to perform the work.  All qualified concerns may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the technical, administrative, and management capability of such offerors to perform this type of work.  The capability statements will be used to determine appropriate procurement strategy, in particular whether a set-aside or an alternate procurement strategy is warranted.
Capability statements are to be submitted not later than March 1, 2011.  The capabilities package submitted should demonstrate the firm's experience and capability to perform the principal components of work provided above.  Packages should include the following information:  
(1) Provide business name, address, business size and type (8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran, Small Business, Large Business, etc.), and point of contact to include e-mail address and telephone number.
(2) Demonstrate the firm's experience by providing a list of projects completed where the work involved designing, manufacturing and installing similar breakers and related components under current industry standards.  The project list should specify the types of breakers designed and installed.  For each project listed, provide the following: dollar value of the job, the facility name, facility location, and the customer's contact name and phone number for the work completed. The purpose of this notice is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of potential contractors.  This is not a request for proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Responses to this sources sought notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.  All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this sources sought notice.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this notice.

THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMISSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES TO THIS RFI.<br />The United States Government (USG) currently utilizes a proprietary Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) Total Asset Visibility (TAV) system manufactured by Tapestry Solutions, Inc, labeled Global Distribution Management System (GDMS) to provide TAV of contracted trucking assets throughout the Afghanistan Theater of Operations. <br />The government is seeking information regarding potential providers of equipment and communication services that can integrate with the GDMS TAV system. The USG is only interested at this point in identifying capable contractors for this requirement.<br />First, does your company manufacture a GPS transponder that is able to transmit data to the GDMS used by USG to show its location with a ping rate of at least once every 15 minutes? With respect to this question, the USG is concerned whether the transponder has the technology to send such a signal, regardless of any subscription services or rights needed to be purchased to actually feed the data into the GDMS used by the USG. <br />Second, does your company provide communication services/software with the ability to feed data into the GDMS used by the USG? For this question, we are interested to find whether other firms have the ability, with respect to both technology and any legal rights or agreements that may be required, to provide communication services/software that can feed a signal from a transponder into the GDMS used by the USG. <br />Interested organizations may submit their capabilities, and qualifications to provide the above mentioned services/hardware in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 1600 Afghanistan time on 16 February 2011.

<p style="BACKGROUND: white; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: EN">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: EN">PPM begins with the development of a comprehensive inventory of all its projects with enough descriptive information about each to allow them to be analyzed and compared. Such descriptive data can include project name, estimated duration, estimated cost, business objective, how the project supports SSA's overall strategies, etc. Establishing the inventory in a database is optimal, allowing for analysis and comparisons.</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: EN">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: EN">Once the project inventory is established, the PPM process requires project sponsors, project managers and portfolio executives to examine each project and prioritize it according to established criteria. The overall list of projects is then considered to develop a well-balanced list of approved projects. The project portfolio is evaluated by the portfolio management team on an agreed upon basis (monthly, quarterly, etc.) to determine which projects are meeting their goals, which may need more support and which may need to be down-sized or dropped entirely. </span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: EN">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; mso-ansi-language: EN">Without the right processes and systems in place, it is tough to assess the value, cost, risk and performance of IT services. SSA is looking to govern IT investments and maximize the business value delivered to take a comprehensive view of the entire scope of IT processes, as well as all IT investments and resources. </span></p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer<br />Balanced Workforce System - Software Tool <br />This exchange is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 15.201(e) as a Request for Information (RFI). Per FAR 15.209(c), please see the following clause:<br /><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997)<br />(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.<br />(b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<br />(c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of developing a Human Capital Segment Architecture (HCSA) across DHS.<br /><br />Additional Notice<br />We reiterate that this is a DHS Request for Information and the use of any procurement terminology does constitute a promise of any kind.<br />The purpose of this RFI is for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to gain knowledge of all qualified and interested small and other than small business concerns with experience within the referenced requirement and is being issued solely for DHS' informational and planning purposes; as it may relate to acquisition strategy, planning schedules, feasibility of the requirement, development of the requirement, etc. This exchange in no way represents a formal solicitation for proposals, quotations, or bids with the intent to form binding agreements based upon results. DHS may (or may not), at the agency's sole discretion, issue a formal solicitation for this requirement at a later time. Within that vein, any descriptive/requirements information provided by DHS in this exchange is subject to change and shall in no way be treated as final or binding. <br /><br />1. Background: <br />Consistent with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policy and the Secretary's Efficiency Initiative on Workforce Assessments (May 2009), DHS requires in-house capabilities to effectively manage government operations. While heavy reliance on contractors when DHS stood up in 2002 may have made sense, it is unlikely that operating in such a manner today is the most efficient and effective way to carry out our mission.</p>
<p>DHS was dependent on contractors to fulfill many of its professional and management support services. In doing so, DHS Executive Management did not fully address the risk to the mission associated with this dependence on contractors to fulfill mission-critical services; the priorities lay in getting the new Agency up and running.</p>
<p>At the request of Congress, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) studied risks associated with DHS's current contract management. GAO's report recommended:</p>
<p>"DHS take actions to improve its ability to manage risk and ensure governmental control and accountability for decisions resulting from services that closely support inherently governmental functions. DHS ... agreed with these recommendations."</p>
<p>Traditionally, each Component identified the type of workforce (Federal employee/contractor services) to perform functions necessary to achieve the Department's missions, goals and objectives. This approach was taken absent a deliberate analysis to ensure the most appropriate workforce necessary to mitigate or minimize risk to the mission. Manual systems could not guarantee a consistent, methodical application of the statutes and rules that would lead each DHS Component through a consistent and transparent analysis of functions necessary to accomplish the Department's missions. . Given the number of functional units (or body of work (approximately 10,000 in 2010) to be analyzed at DHS, the process was inefficient, prone to mistakes, resource - intensive and time consuming. <br /><br />Citing "inadequate" progress to date on analyzing multi-sector workforce, on July 12, 2010, the Deputy Secretary for DHS issued a memorandum directing the Department to "act more quickly and comprehensively to ensure the appropriate mix of Federal and contractor skills and experience". The Deputy Secretary directed the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) to draft and implement guidance reflecting her desire for "more significant and demonstrable results - going forward." Accordingly, the Balanced Workforce Program Management Office (BWPMO) was established within OCHCO and issued the BWS Guidance pursuant to, and consistent with, these authorities, policies, related OMB guidance and at the express direction of the DHS Deputy Secretary.</p>
<p>The Balanced Workforce Strategy (BWS) is a repeatable process established to assess, and then result in, the appropriate mix of federal and contractor employees. A balanced multi-sector workforce ensures successful achievement and sustainment of the Department's mission while simultaneously minimizing the potential for operational risk. <br /><br />The BWS will serve as the strategic underpinning for the DHS workforce planning model, which takes a long-term view of organizational needs and function changes as a result of evolving missions, priorities, and environmental factors. In the near term, the BWS process is focused on assessing and eliminating potential overreliance on contractors, resulting in an appropriate balance of federal employee to contractors. Over time, BWS will dovetail with and be subsumed into the Department's overall workforce planning model, including the identification, tracking and successful closing of competency gaps. <br /><br />2. Requirements:<br /><br />The DHS Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) is seeking information on existing COTS products capable of providing automated decision support. The primary objective is to guide the user through a decision tree based on user defined criteria stemming from government statues or mandates, to determine if a position is inherently governmental. The tool must comply with all applicable DHS regulations, including security and safety. <br /><br />&bull; The tool must meet the following functional requirements:<br /><br />Configurable: The COTS product will provide the system administrator the ability to define, configure and update the following:<br /><br />&#61485; User groups and permissions for system access<br />&#61485; Web based questionnaire interface, user- defined data validation and navigation rules for functional unit analysis<br />&#61485; The decision tree that defines the logic flow / navigation for the questionnaire (splitting and branching)<br />&#61485; The workflow managing the Review / Approval process<br />&#61485; The questionnaire's data structures (add or inactivate fields and tables, data validation)<br />&#61485; BWS Tool users must be able to access the application on DHS Government furnished equipment (a DHS workstation connected to DHS intranet).<br />&#61485; The Tool content must be protected and safe. The application must Generate artifacts that will import and/or export to SQL Server, Microsoft 2007 products (e.g. csv, XLS, etc)<br />&#61485; Access to standard queries and reports (tabular, counts)<br />&#61485; Ad hoc queries and reports (tabular, counts)<br />&#61485; The Tool will meet the following functional requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Work Sourcing Analysis: The Tool will guide users through a questionnaire interface to determine if a functional unit can be performed by a Federal employee and/or a contract service employee. The COTS product's interface will be controlled by a user-defined and user-updatable decision tree, governed by the government statutes, policies, procedures, and mandates to determine the most appropriate source for workload performance and the need for federal employee oversight.</p>
<p>&bull; The Tool will automatically generate a unique identifier associated with each analysis.</p>
<p>&bull; The Tool will have user copy, paste, revision, cloning and printing capability.</p>
<p>&bull; The Tool must support risk analysis capabilities composed of a series of mathematical equation type questions resulting in weighted responses.</p>
<p>&bull; Review / Approval: The COTS product requires user-configurable workflow management functionality to route each analysis' recommendation and track the Review and Approval process. This phase begins after the user identifies or submits (automatically saves) a functional unit for analysis. Higher level officials may document comments regarding program officials' analysis and provide input that will override (but not delete) program officials' analysis recommendations.</p>
<p>&bull; Data Base Management System Capability: The COTS product will support the addition of user-defined data fields/structures and support a report engine that allows administrators and users to define reports and queries (which may include user defined data fields/structures). The reporting engine must support role based access. The DBMS must support MS SQL 2005 or later and/or Oracle 10g or later.</p>
<p>&bull; The COTS product must support Single Sign On (SSO) via LDAP</p>
<p>&bull; The COTS product must be available to be hosted within DHS data centers</p>
<p>&bull; System should support approximately 30 administrators who will grant user access across Components. <br /><br />&bull; System must support unlimited users responsible for performing an analysis with the potential of over 500 concurrent users at any given time.</p>
<p>3. Questions <br /><br />In addition to demonstrating the necessary capabilities and qualifications to perform the above identified requirements, all prospective vendors shall respond to the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Please provide a description and overview of COTS products and services capable of meeting the requirements.<br />2. Please provide published rates and order of magnitude cost including maintenance cost for licenses, product or service.<br />3.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and City of Everett Public Works Department are hosting an Industry Day on 23 February 2011 at 10:00 am (local time) to solicit feedback associated with the Union Slough, Section 1135 Restoration Project.  The Seattle District is seeking your valuable expertise.  We welcome collaboration with industry representatives to review our requirement and discuss mutual issues and concerns relative to our technical requirements.  <BR><BR>If your company is interested in participating in the subject Industry Day, please complete the "Sign up RSVP for Industry Day" form and return it to Maria Colville via email: maria.a.colville@usace.army.mil.  Detailed information regarding project location, parking, and other information will be provided to respondents.  Please RSVP by 18 February 2011 at 2:00 pm Local Time.<BR><BR>This notice is for planning purposes only and is not a notice of solicitation issuance. This notice does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued in the future. The Government will not reimburse Contractors for any effort resulting from their response to this notice.  Please note that attendance to the Industry Day event does not obligate the Government to a contract award for a future project.  This announcement is Government market research, and may result in revisions in both its requirements and its acquisition strategy based on industry responses.<BR><BR>Project Description Summary:<BR><BR>Background: The Union Slough Bridge Removal Project is located adjacent to the Union Slough sub-channel of the Snohomish River in the City of Everett, on Smith Island in Snohomish County, Washington. Smith Island is located in the Snohomish River estuary, east of downtown Everett and Interstate 5.  <BR>The existing levee was breached along Union Slough in three locations and pedestrian bridges were constructed at each of the three 180-foot breaches.  Tidal connections in the sites have not established as planned.  The site floods as designed during high tide but does not adequately drain during low tides.  <BR>Project Description: The Union Slough Bridge Removal Project will consist of relocation and paving along the setback levee, removal of three pedestrian bridges, removal of remnant levee material along the slough side of the breaches, and the creation of additional low flow channels within the estuary that will facilitate more rapid and complete drainage between tide cycles.<BR>The Corps will allow the contractor to determine means and methods within established performance criteria. The Corps will develop a basic plan and sequence and establish water quality criteria for the contractor. Contractors will determine which equipment and techniques would best allow them to complete the project within the prescribed time-line while meeting the specific performance criteria.<BR>Because of elevation requirements, to open up the breaches for more complete drainage and the predicted tide elevations, it will be necessary to either isolate the work areas or operate within the breach areas during wet conditions. Discussions with National Marine Fishery Service, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Washington Department of Ecology, determined that isolation of the estuary was not preferred.  Although isolation of a single site may be allowed.<BR>It is anticipated that the project will include the use of silt screens along the slough along with localized isolation techniques to allow working in a wet environment. Temporary bypass roads and turnarounds may be constructed near the south and central bridge within the City's jurisdictional boundaries. All work on the northern bridge would be from existing levee access roads.   Contractors may use existing bridges at their own risk.<BR>The recommended plan includes the following measures to address the existing conditions and achieve the expected ecosystem restoration benefits at the Union Slough site:<BR> 	Remove the three bridges that now span the three dike breaches in the levee along the west bank of Union Slough.  Bridge removal will include the demolition and removal of the concrete arches that make up the bridge spans. The footings and three-foot thick geogrid foundation material will be removed.  The estimated earthwork for the geogrid and remnant levee material removal is approximately 4,500 CY per breach.<BR> 	Temporary access road construction may be utilized to provide better through-access for hauling bridge debris and waste materials.  These features would only occur at the southern and central bridge locations, within the City's jurisdictional boundaries.  Access roads would require the temporary placement of approximately 600 CY of spalls and surfacing material per breach.<BR> 	Paving of the pedestrian trail (an asphalt pavement path) approximately 750 feet west of its current location to run along the top of the levee on the east side of the Everett Water Pollution Control Facility.  A six foot tall chain-link fence will be constructed to provide security for the treatment facility.<BR> 	Create additional tidal channels in the site to improve hydraulic connectivity. Internal channel construction will include the excavation of low flow channels at specific locations to allow better drainage of internal areas. These channels would be approximately 8' wide and one to three feet deep.<BR> 	Remove remnant levee material near breaches to improve hydraulic capacity.  Remnant levee material removal will include the removal of material along the slough side of each breach. This will allow free drainage along the full span of the breach.<BR><BR>(End of Document)<BR>

<p>FIRESAFE - The AFUO is interested to know what is being developed in the FR industry. We are always eager to see new technology.</p>
<p>Cold Weather/Outerwear - The AFUO is nearing the end of its research phase in the Cold Weather and Outerwear Initiative. This phase will end in May 2011 when the results of an Air Force-wide survey will be delivered to the AFUO. The overarching goal of this survey is to expose capability gaps in current products and to better understand end user needs.</p>
<p>Boots (Flyers) - The AFUO is continuing work on its Safe-to-Fly process. Initial submissions for Safe-to-Fly (STF) certifications were temperate weather boots; however, the AFUO is currently exploring options to include hot and cold weather variants as well.</p>
<p>Boots (Industrial) - The AFUO is scheduled to receive additional samples of Industrial Boots to certify in March 2011. As with the Flyer's Boots, the AFUO is currently exploring options to accept hot and cold weather variants of the Industrial Boot.</p>
<p>Alaska Work Group - The AFUO is seeking arctic-condition concept products and/or materials for pilots of ejection seat aircraft. Concepts should include aircrew equipment such as fire-resistant (FR) base layers, secondary layers, sleeping bags, gloves, and boots. These products need to integrate with existing flight equipment (G-suit, survival vest, etc.) and may need to comply with other flight safety criteria.</p>
<p>The following is a conceptual application of interested items:</p>
<p>A pilot begins pre flight operations which take place inside a hangar, outside condition are 10&deg;F with mild wind conditions (temperature &lt;0&deg;F). The pilot experiences technical difficulties and is forced to eject. The pilot is then subjected to a 10+ minute decent in sub zero temperature (&gt;-20&deg;F). Upon reaching the ground, the pilot will need to survive for 72 hours in temperatures reaching -50&deg;F.</p>
<p>Additional factors to consider are glove tactility, pack ability, and interaction with existing flight/survival equipment.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (Soldier, Chemical, Research & Test), Natick Contracting Division, ATTN: CCRD-NA, Natick, MA, has a requirement in support of US Army PM-Force Sustainment Systems to procure up to 186 Joint Precision Airdrop Systems (JPADS) 2K in order to complete the AAO requirements for this program.  Airborne Systems, NA of Pennsauken, NJ, is currently the only manufacturer producing these systems at this time and is the one that can meet the proposed delivery.  These systems are currently being deployed in Theater at this time.  Given the history of this program along with Market Research that has been conducted by Technical experts, this is the best cost savings for the Government. Having to set-up a First Article Test and a new production line with a new contractor, for such a small quantity, would drastically impede the fielding schedule for deploying troops. This acquisition will be procured under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), paragraph 6.302-1(a)(2), entitled "Only One Responsible Source".  Telephone calls will not be accepted. Questions may be sent to Huy Le, Contract Specialist via e-mail at huy.le@us.army.mil.

This monitoring and reporting system allows TMA to provide its supporters with a single, consistent source for economic, legislative, regulatory, trademark, brand, and statistical data: market by market and company by company. This tool allows TTB personnel to stay up-to-date on what is occurring in the industry - the development and introduction of new products, changes to companies, identifying companies and their revenue to ensure compliance, and the imports and exports of US products to other countries.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility to demonstrate how your product is capable of providing the same information as is provided through use of TMA's online access tool. The Government will not seek additional information from your company if you fail to provide sufficient evidence of having a product cable of meeting the Government's needs.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government's Contracting Officer.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) Benefits Officers Training and Development (BOTD) group is hosting a five-day Benefits conference which will provide a series of workshops on Retirement, Insurance, Social Security, and Thrift Savings Plan Administration. As part of the conference, there will be a vendor's exhibit area. The following information is for vendors who may wish to exhibit at the 2011 Federal Benefits Conference to be held at the Sheraton New Orleans Hotel, New Orleans, Louisiana.<br /><br />For additional information and an exhibit area registration form, please contact Brandon Mitchell of Power Train, 301-731-0900 ext 110.<br /><br />Subject: 2011 Benefits Training Exhibits<br /><br /><br /><br />The U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Retirement Services, Benefits Officers Training and Development (BOTD) will hold its 2011 Benefits Conference in New Orleans, LA on June 6-10, 2011, at the Sheraton New Orleans Hotel located at 500 Canal Street, New Orleans, Louisiana, 70130. This year the Benefits Conference will have a vendor exhibit area on June 8 and 9. The purpose of the training is to update the group on initiatives in the area, share information among agencies about actions some have taken to deal with benefits education, increased workloads, etc., and address crosscutting issues in retirement, insurance, Social Security, workers compensation, and Thrift Savings Plan administration. In addition, this year's event will feature a 2 &frac12; day conference, 20th Anniversary Benefits Conference (held on June 8 and 9 and &frac12; day on the 10th), which will include the 5th Annual Symposium on Retirement Financial Education and Federal retirement and benefits related plenary and breakout sessions. This 2 &frac12; day conference will have general sessions of interest to all, providing an overview of our retirement financial education programs as well as news and updates on current Federal benefits programs. In the past approximately a third of the attendees were Federal agency headquarters level staff with responsibility for administering the benefits programs within their agencies. The other attendees were field staff with benefits administration responsibilities at the field level. We anticipate approximately 425 agency representatives to attend this event. <br /><br /><br /><br />Up to 30 exhibit spaces are available. Exhibitors will rent the space directly from Power Train Inc, who is acting on OPM's behalf to manage the exhibit booths and facilitate set up and dismantle with the on-site display company. The rental application and payment will be submitted to Power Train. Power Train will accept payment by check, VISA or MasterCard. <br /><br /><br />Exhibit spaces will be allocated on a first come first served basis. Registration must be received by May 6, 2011. The exhibit area will be on the 3rd floor of the Hotel. Exhibitors may set up beginning at 8:30 am, June 8th. Exhibits must be removed by 4:00pm June 9th. Sessions in the Ballroom begin at 8:30 am each day and end at 4:30 pm. The attendees will have a number of opportunities to visit the exhibit area on June 8th and 9th. The staffed exhibit booths will be 8' by 10' with pipe and drape and will include signage, an electrical outlet, one table and two chairs. The cost of a staffed exhibit booth is $ 1,175.00 for an 8' by 10' booth. Any other items needed for your booth; such as, VCR/DVD with monitor, phone line, internet access, etc., is available for an extra charge. You must notify Power Train of any additional requests. <br /><br /><br /><br />There is limited space available after the daily sessions (between 4:30 - 6:00 pm) for vendors to provide activities for attendees supporting the HealthierFeds initiatives. These activities could include workshops on healthy eating; demonstration activities such as aerobics, Pilates or stretching programs; sample health assessments; sample work site audits; or similar activities. The exhibitor cost is $750 to sponsor one of these activities. This fee covers the cost of the room for the session and placement of a vendor provided poster (maximum size 24' by 30") in the Ballroom Foyer area during registration on Sunday evening and all day Monday through Thursday.<br /><br /><br /><br />Participation in the exhibit area does not mean that the U.S. Office of Personnel Management in any way endorses or approves the vendor or its products or services. Exhibitors may not represent in any way that their participation at the Benefits Training event represents any endorsements or approval by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. <br /><br /><br /><br />For additional information and an exhibit area registration form, please contact Brandon Mitchell of Power Train, 301-731-0900 ext 110.</span></p>

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government. However, the new SKILCRAFT branded product can be bid and sold to the Government by any authorized dealer.
<p>The Committee has been asked to consider adding the Broad Government Requirement for the following product to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN: 7920-00-NIB-0521<br />Name: Duster Material, Easy Trap, Dispenser Box, Large<br />Description: 8X6X30ft Easy Trap Large Size Duster Material in Dispenser Box. Pop-up dispenser attaches to housecleaning cart</p>
<p>NSN: 7920-00-NIB-0520<br />Name: Duster Material, Easy Trap, Roll, Large<br />Description: 8X6X125ft Easy Trap Large Size Duster Material Roll</p>
<p>NSN: 7920-00-NIB-0503<br />Name: Duster Material, Easy Trap, Dispenser Box, Standard Size<br />Description: 5X6X30ft Easy Trap Standard Size Duster Material in Dispenser Box. Pop-up dispenser attaches to housecleaning cart</p>
<p>NSN: 7920-00-NIB-0502<br />Name: Duster Material, Easy Trap, Roll, Standard Size<br />Description: 5X6X125ft Easy Trap Standard Size Duster Material Roll</p>
<p>Should this item be added to the PL, the contracting agency will be the General Services Administration, Fort Worth, TX.<br /><br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income. Similar products are:</p>

<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than March 1, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">To License and Commercialize SLIDER &ndash; Rapid Optical Deflector for Recording Ultrafast Optical Signals</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Opportunity</span></span></strong><strong><span>: </span></strong>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), <span>is offering the opportunity to license and commercialize SLIDER (Serrated Light Illumination for Deflection Encoded Recording). <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This technology has resulted in a new device that rapidly deflects optical beams enabling an ordinary camera to record pulsed signals with picosecond resolution and at sampling rates exceeding 2 Tera-Samples/sec.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Background</span></span></strong><strong><span>:<span>&nbsp; </span></span></strong>Conventional signal recording technologies include vacuum tube oscilloscopes and digital oscilloscopes. Vacuum tube oscilloscopes are becoming obsolete. Digital oscilloscopes rely largely on state-of-the-art electronic-based analog-to-digital converters that have exhibited very slow improvement in recent years and are limited to trading off dynamic range or bit depth for temporal resolution<span>.</span> <span>&nbsp;</span>Streak cameras are capable of higher performance but below 10 ps resolution, they suffer in dynamic range due to space-charge repulsion effects occurring within the electron beam.<span>&nbsp; </span>This invention abandons electronics and turns to a novel rapid optical deflection technology in order to provide a &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; optical signal recording device.<span>&nbsp; </span>SLIDER does this by deflecting a signal-carrying optical beam propagating in the plane of a slab waveguide at a sweep rate of 1 resolvable spot per picosecond.<span>&nbsp; </span>The swept beam can then be recorded in parallel and on a single-shot basis (without averaging) on an ordinary, high dynamic range camera.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Description</span></span></strong><strong><span>:<span>&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>The SLIDER deflector includes a waveguide, a serrated mask positioned above the waveguide cladding, and a synchronized pump beam.<span>&nbsp; </span>The pump beam illuminates the serrated mask with a short pulse and transfers its pattern to the guiding layer where it imprints a sequence of prisms.<span>&nbsp; </span>The prisms are activated via nonlinear optical effects in the semiconductor and persist for the duration of the sweep.<span>&nbsp; </span>The signal beam is coupled into the waveguide and is deflected in piecewise segments by the fine sequence of prisms.<span>&nbsp; </span>Time-of-flight through the waveguide ensures a linear mapping of time to angle.<span>&nbsp; </span>Lenses at the output of the map the deflection onto the focal plane of a high fidelity camera where the signal can be recorded in parallel with high resolution and with high dynamic range.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.25in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Advantages</span></span></strong><strong><span>:<span>&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span><span> </span>This system achieves high resolution (picosecond) with a high dynamic range (&gt; 3000:1) by eliminating electrons as in a conventional streak camera and replacing them with photons that do not suffer space-charge effects.<span>&nbsp; </span>It also has the potential to be produced with components at a reasonable cost.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Opportunity</span></span></strong><strong><span>: </span></strong>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), <span>is offering the opportunity to build and demonstrate a novel sensor and actuator technology that would provide an automated mechanism for electric power demand response. The likely partner will be a power electronics manufacturer.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Background</span></span></strong><strong><span>: </span></strong>Many States are increasing standards requirements for contributions from renewable power generation assets such as solar photovoltaic and wind. Intermittent generation from these devices will require corresponding changes in other storage or generation assets or responsive demand.<span>&nbsp; </span>In addition, the solid state inverters used for these new sources of power generation will decrease characteristic response times, which will present system stability challenges.<span>&nbsp; </span>The new technology developed by LLNL would help address both of these issues by providing demand response at the sub-second timescale.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Description</span></span></strong><strong><span>:<span>&nbsp; </span></span></strong>The new LLNL technology would sense active control or other signals from the grid and automatically shed or re-establish load as appropriate. This gradual reduction and reestablishment of load would give operators more time to reconfigure grid resources to respond to the transient.<span>&nbsp; </span>This increased time window for reaction should lead to lower operating costs with the current grid architecture and reduced need combustion turbines to manage the grid.<span>&nbsp; </span>LLNL envisions the development of a simulation model of the devices in a grid environment to establish the value proposition and to optimize the design while prototype devices are manufactured. Subsequently, based on selections, criteria and observations of key issues from the simulations, the devices would be tested in a physical testbed. <strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -1in;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>Advantages</span></span></strong><strong><span>:<span>&nbsp; </span></span></strong>The devices would respond to control signals or indictors of system distress much faster than current demand response systems. The devices can be embedded in appliances, be sold by the utilities as adaptors for appliances or other loads. Utilities could offer the adaptors under incentive programs in a manner similar to the programs in place for compact fluorescent light bulbs. Appliance manufactures could install them and label the appliance in a manner similar to the Energy Star program in California.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC><p>Historical Imagery Digitization Data Project (HID2P)<br />Request for Information</p>
<p>Introduction<br />The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is seeking to identify potential sources and conduct market research to help determine the most effective and efficient options to digitize large volumes of high resolution photographic imagery to specific criteria.</p>
<p>This RFI is issued for the purpose of determining interest, feasibility, and capability only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal or indication the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services contained in this notice. In accordance with FAR 52.215-3, the Government will not pay for any information/items submitted in response to this synopsis. Data will not be returned. This RFI does not commit the Government to award a contract. This RFI is for market research only and there is currently no solicitation for this effort. Any solicitation resulting from this announcement will be published separately. Any final plan will be done consistent with E.O 12951 and E.O 13526 dealing with historical intelligence imagery acquired by a space-based national intelligence reconnaissance system.</p>
<p>Background<br />The NGA is anticipating the potential declassification of significant amounts of film based imagery. A large volume of film based imagery may become declassified in 2011 and would be the basis of an initial effort to digitize historical film based imagery. The NGA is interested in exploring options to have the declassified film digitized and potentially stored with various distribution possibilities.</p>
<p>What we wish to accomplish: 1) seeking innovative solutions within government, industry and academia that are affordable, and practical, 2) provide access to digitized imagery at a level of quality that NGA deems useful and meaningful, while 3) leading to future enrichment of GEOINT observations in an unclassified environment.</p>
<p>Solution approach(es): There may be variations to this approach, but essentially industry is given access to original negative or 2nd generation dupe positive or 3rd generation dupe negatives, with supporting coverage and ephemeris data, for a period of 1 to 2 years to:<br />&bull; Scan imagery at a minimum 10 micron or better spatial resolution (4-5 micron), with a dynamic range of at least 10 bits per pixel, either on government premises or at their place of work. Imagery is stored on 500 foot spools, with many frames up to several feet in length. The nominal thickness of the film is 2.5 microns for original negative, and in some cases may be as thin as 1 micron thickness. Dupe negative (2nd generation) or dupe positive (3rd generation imagery) is also available and has a nominal thickness of 2.5 mils, but may have image processing edge sharpness enhancements, other film handling artifacts, and for certain scenes may have lower resolution compared to the original negative imagery.<br />&bull; Due to the classification of the current film imagery, and until such time as the imagery samples are declassified, details of the film format are not included in this RFI. The responders are encouraged to identify film handling limitations in their RFI responses.<br />&bull; Provide or make available a digital copy of the scanned imagery to NGA, and a description of the type of storage media that may be provided.<br />&bull; Retain rights to distribute declassified imagery and recoup investment, for a specified period of time (negotiable), seek greatest flexibility to allow industry to form partnerships to digitize and/or store initial digital data (up to 10 Petabytes) for online, nearline or offline access. <br />&bull; Government retains rights to limit distribution of this imagery over certain areas of the world<br />&bull; Security requirements: The work can be performed in an unclassified but access controlled environment. We are interested in understanding if the facilities can operate at the TOP SECRET/SCI level for potential follow on activity.<br />&bull; Risk and cost is mostly on the contractor. The government performs in an advisory capacity, and oversight for security and support on logistical matters of common concern for the safe handling and use of the imagery. <br />&bull; The RFI response should not be too specific to limit innovation or efficiencies that may be devised by the responder but should contain the necessary details to understand the underlying business model. We encourage a consortium of industry and/or academic partners to develop the most capable and flexible hardware and image processing technology. <br />o Maturity and availability of technology: The response should describe to the extent practical by the responder, which is not proprietary in nature or fact, a short description of engineering for example with hardware, optics, transport, electronics/computer peripherals, and/or detector components that can achieve a level of quality. If there are limitations on handling film widths up to 9 inches, please identify the limiting factors to the output of digitized imagery at a quality and quantity that we may seek,or that which can be achieved with engineering or fabrication of components, software and so forth. The government is not interested in a detailed quantitative description of engineering or other efforts, but only seeks to understand the nature of technical and schedule risks for a certain level of performance that can be addressed by respondants's innovative approaches and the degree of risk and cost that they may be able to handle or share in due consideration of benefits that they may seek to attain in their business case.</p>
<p>Information Requested<br />Interested companies are requested to submit the information outlined below. <br />&bull; Experience in digitizing film with high resolution on a large scale of holdings. This should include previous examples with details such as the equipment used, volume (scale) of film digitized, resolution of digitization, any unique film attributes (size, length, thickness), timeline from start to finish to complete the project, and any post data processing requirements completed on the project. <br />&bull; Business Case. Respondents should include sufficient details to understand the underlying business case to include assumptions, and any cost sharing arrangement. <br />&bull; Overall notional schedule. The notional schedule should include assumptions used to develop the schedule. The schedule shall use a hypothetical start date of 1 October 2011 and continue through the end of life of the program. The duration should be based on digitizing up to approximately 4 million linear feet of film up to approximately 7 inches in width. <br />o Potential pilot effort. The Government is considering a pilot effort depending on the number and quality of the submissions. This pilot effort would include actual digitizing of up to 6 separate scenes to demonstrate respondent's capabilities. Two of the scenes may be color or false color film. Respondents should include details on their ability to support a pilot effort with a completion by December 2011 in their RFI response. <br />&bull; Film handling requirements. The film will be made available once the final steps are completed to declassify the imagery. All respondents should identify how the film needs to be made available to them as well as how they will store, safeguard and handle the film (in compliance NARA requirements) and associated electronic data, during the film digitizing process in a facility that can be cleared to the Top Secret/SCI level. The film will need to be returned after the digitizing is completed.</p>

<DESC>In accordance with FAR 6.302 and 5.2, this notice advertises the government's intent to award a non-competitive contract to the City of Port Angeles, Peninsula Communications Service (PENCOM) for one base year plus four option years at firm-fixed prices per year.  PENCOM provides Olympic National Park after-hours dispatch/emergency communications service per the Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2004, still in effect.  PENCOM provides service during the block of time when the Olympic National Park dispatch/communications office is closed.  Olympic National Park lacks its own staff, funding, and other resources necessary to maintain its own 24-hour emergency communications operation.
Comments and questions regarding this announcement may be directed to Phaedra Fuller, Contracting Officer, at phaedra_fuller@nps.gov.  All comments received before February 23, 2011 will be considered.  


JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,000 AND UP TO $100,000  (See FAR 13.106-1)
Date:   01/24/2011      Requisition Number: R9506110001
1.  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ITEM/SERVICE BEING PROCURED AND ITS INTENDED USE (INCLUDE ANTICIPATED COST):  
Non-competitive award (base year + four option years) to the City of Port Angeles, for the purpose of paying quarterly invoices for PENCOM services, in effect from 01/01/11 to 09/30/15 (3 quarters in base year FY11, and 4 quarters per year for option years FY12 - FY15).   The after-hours dispatch service provided by the City of Port Angeles is unique because the service is provided through a network called PENCOM, which is a 24-hour emergency communications service; a division of the Port Angeles Police Department and operates under the direction of the Chief of Police.  FY11 cost is $25,500 plus $34,000 for each option year from FY12-FY15.  The aggregate total cost for five years is $161,500.
2.  SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (CHECK ONE AND EXPLAIN BELOW): 
__x___	Only one responsible source. ______	Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. Include critical delivery or performance dates, and when you became aware of the requirement.  Provide a specific statement of the impact on Government operations, financial or otherwise, if the required delivery or performance dates are not met. ______ Other  
EXPLAIN:  
41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) AND FAR 6.302-1 ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE AND NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES WILL SATISFY AGENCY REQUIREMENTS: 
PENCOM is funded by most of the law enforcement, fire, and emergency service agencies in Clallam County, Washington, and these agencies make up an advisory board which helps guide the operation of PENCOM.  The 16 member agencies are City of Port Angeles Fire and Police, the Clallam County Sheriff, City of Sequim Police, Fire Districts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, Lower Elwha Tribal Police, City of Forks Police, La Push Police, Jamestown Fish and Game, Forks Ambulance, Olympic Ambulance, and Olympic National Park.  No private sector entity or other public safety dispatch operations are available to provide equivalent services.  
A Memorandum of Understanding was signed in 2004 by the city of Port Angeles, Clallam County, city of Sequim, Clallam County Rural Fire Department, Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, Quileute Tribe, and the National Park Service/Olympic National Park (OLYM).  The agreement is still valid.  Each party pays a portion of cost for receipt of PENCOM services.  Annual cost for OLYM is determined by a PENCOM funding formula, which states "Olympic National Park's fee is charged at the same rate as the lowest paying law enforcement member, but in no case lower than $10,000."  
In accordance with the formula, "The number of full time sworn officers for each Member is multiplied by $2,000 for a base amount. These numbers are then totaled and subtracted from the police share of the overall budget.  The total is then divided further based on the percentage of calls for service for those agencies that use PENCOM's full services, including the records management system.  The base amount is added to the percentage amount for a grand total for each member."   
Between 2006 and 2010, OLYM paid $10,000 annually.  On January 1, 2011, PENCOM raised OLYM's annual rate to $34,000.  Using the formula, OLYM's share for fiscal year 2011 is $25,500 ($8,500 per quarter for quarters 2, 3, and 4, from January 2011 to September 2011).  OLYM has fiscal year 2011 funds available (to be awarded as the "base year") in the amount of $25,500.  
The annual cost for fiscal years 2012 through 2015, which will be awarded as option years, will remain fixed in the amount of $34,000 (equal to 4 quarters at $8,500 per quarter each option year).  The total price for the base year plus four option years is $161,500.  Funds will be obligated in accordance with Principles of Federal Appropriations Law (Red Book), one fiscal year at a time.
PENCOM has fifteen communications officers, three supervisors, one communications manager, two IT/computer staff, and one warrant/restraining entry program support staff.  PENCOM covers 911 "dispatch" with a minimum of three communications officers (public safety dispatchers) on duty 14 hours a day, 7 days a week.  If OLYM were to provide its own after-hours dispatch service, it would require running the same type of 24-hour operation, hiring an additional 2.5 FTE of GS-06 dispatchers at a salary (no benefits) of $30,600 per FTE.  Salary alone would cost OLYM approximately $75,000 annually.  The total estimate, including salary, benefits, additional utilities, support costs, training to keep up certifications, etc. is approximately $90,000 to $100,000 annually.  
PENCOM's annual cost of $25,500 for FY11, and $34,000 annually for FY12 - FY15, when compared to what OLYM would spend performing the service in-house, is considered to be fair and reasonable.
3.  MARKET RESEARCH.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest:
Market research was not conducted because the City of Port Angeles is the only entity set up to provide PENCOM services.  PENCOM is networked to several county, state, federal, and Native American entities, and no equivalent system or network exists in the private sector or by a single federal agency.    
4.  IF THIS IS A DETERMINATION FOR SOLE SOURCE, THE CONTRACTING OFFICER CERTIFIES:
     a.  Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist.      b.  The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in      FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District (CESAM) intends to extend the ordering period of IDIQ Contract W91278-08-D-0013 with A-E contractor Benham-Ellerbe Becket from 28 Feb 2011 to 31 Aug 2011.  The expected studies and services to be conducted during this extension period include master planning, capital investment proposal package preparation, feasibility studies, designs, and assessments for US Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) requirements at various Army medical treatment and support facilities.  The expected efforts will primarily be follow-on requirements resulting from work currently underway or recently completed by the A-E.  MEDCOM has an active program to plan and execute infrastructure repairs and capital improvement projects.  Benham is currently under contract to execute planning and design work in support of this program, and additional requirements have been identified at various sites relating to the planning and design work already underway or recently completed.  Without the background and knowledge of the facilities and their condition and functions which Benham has gained to date, it would be difficult and require extra time and cost for another A-E to execute the follow-on requirements.    Contract Number W91278-08-D-0013 was awarded to BENHAM-ELLERBE BECKET through full and open competition on 29 February 2008.  The current action will be a waiver to extend the contract expiration date to 31 August 2011 at no additional cost to the government.  The statutory authority permitting acquisition of the requirement by other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302.1(a)(2)(iii), only one responsible source and not other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements.<BR>Interested persons who identify their interest and capability to respond to the statements by 28 Feb 2011 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete these proposed contract actions based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Capability Statements submitted should demonstrate the offerors experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government. The statement shall include business size; ability to self-perform work; layers of subcontracting; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet these specific requirements. Statements should not exceed five pages in length. Written inquiries may be directed to Rosemary Hall via email at Rosemary.c.hall@usace.army.mil.

This is a notice of intent stating that the West Palm Beach VAMC intends to award a sole source Cost-Per-Test contract to Polymedco, Inc. for the performance of Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Testing services.
The West Palm Beach VAMC has a need for a Cost-Per-Test Contract for Automated Immuno Fecal Occult Blood Testing.  Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) plus sigmoidoscopy is a preferred screening option for Colorectal Cancer.   The sensitivity of immunochemical testing is superior to our current manual testing methodology.     
Market research has demonstrated that while other Immunochemical Fecal Occult Blood Testing products on the market, Polymedco, Inc. , a small business, has the only automated system on the market and is on FSS contract V797P-7136A under NAICS code 334516.   
The ever-increasing screening  volume  at this facility dictates that a faster, more reliable testing method be put in place, which is found to be via the cost-per-test services provided soley by the OC Auto Micro 80 including and all reagents, collection devices, and consumables by:

 Section I
  
I.1 52.232-33 PAYMENT BY ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER--CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (OCT 2003)  


     (a) Method of payment. 
          (1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a) (2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer. 
          (2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either- 
               (i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or 
               (ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause). 
     (b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the CCR database. 
     (c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR part 210. 
     (d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the CCR database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the CCR database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
     (e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. 
          (1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for- 
               (i) Making a correct payment; 
               (ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and 
               (iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. 
          (2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and- 
               (i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or 
               (ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply. 
     (f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. 
      (g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the CCR database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. 
     (h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent. 
     (i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the CCR database. 
                                                             
(End of clause) 

 

I.2 52.239-1 PRIVACY OR SECURITY SAFEGUARDS (AUG 1996)  

  (a) The Contractor shall not publish or disclose in any manner, without the Contracting Officer's written consent, the details of any safeguards either designed or developed by the Contractor under this contract or otherwise provided by the Government. 
  (b) To the extent required to carry out a program of inspection to safeguard against threats and hazards to the security, integrity, and confidentiality of Government data, the Contractor shall afford the Government access to the Contractor's facilities, installations, technical capabilities, operations, documentation, records, and databases. 
  (c) If new or unanticipated threats or hazards are discovered by either the Government or the Contractor, of if existing safeguards have ceased to function, the discoverer shall immediately bring the situation to the attention of the other party.


(End of clause) 


Thank you; and we look forward to hearing from.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, are being utilized for this acquisition. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-48.
<p>Offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of each potential offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to this solicitation. Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541519. This requirement is being competed as a small business set-aside whereby Quest-authorized resellers/business partners will be the potential offeror base.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:<br />The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3, and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a)(1), and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-36; 52.225-13; 52.232-33. All provisions and clauses viewed at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.</p>
<p>Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, does not apply to this acquisition because this is maintenance for software that has already been purchased previously.</p>
<p>The Office of Information Systems Management (OISM) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) currently owns Quest Software licenses for Toad and Foglight for Oracle. This software is used for monitoring/controlling/reporting of the NIST financial Oracle databases, servers, applications and websites. The current maintenance expires on February 28, 2011. In order to continue using the existing Quest licenses, maintenance renewal is required as specified below.<br /><br />This requirement consists of the Contract Line Items in the attached RFQ. Quotations shall be tailored to the exact items listed. The Contractor shall provide the items listed in the attached RFQ for the period March 1, 2011 through February 28, 2012.</p>
<p>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:<br />This procurement is for the renewal of maintenance services to be provided for existing Quest software licenses that include product updates and technical support. The maintenance for this software is provided only by Quest or its authorized resellers. If the maintenance renewal is not procured, NIST will be unable to use the software that it already owns. Procuring a software program other than Quest is not in the best interest of OISM at this time due to the time and resources that would be needed to train employees on the new program. According to market research, Quest offers all the features required by OISM bundled together. Some of these features are PLSQL development environment, SQL Tuning, Database performance monitoring, application monitoring via transaction record/play-back, Server host monitoring for AIX, Solaris, Windows and Linux. It is required that all of these features be in a web based environment that conforms to FIPS 140-2 TLS requirements. <br />All responsible offerors that are small businesses and are Quest-authorized resellers/business partners are invited to submit quotations in accordance with the instructions below. Only quotes from Quest authorized resellers/business partners will be accepted and evaluated. <br /><br />ADDENDUM TO PROVISION 52.212-1 - QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS <br />Paragraph (b) below replaces paragraph (b) in provision 52.212-1.<br />(b) Submission of quotations. Submit signed and dated quotations to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on company letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, quotations must include- <br />(1) The solicitation number; <br />(2) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; <br />(3) Technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with requirements in the solicitation. Item MUST meet exact specifications as laid out in the description attached. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;<br />(4) Terms of any expressed warranty;<br />(5) Firm-fixed price for each CLIN and discount terms;<br />(6) Acknowledgement of solicitation amendment(s);<br />(7) Include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Quotations that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>NIST reserves the right to award a purchase order without discussions, based solely on the submission of the Contractor.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The award will be made to the responsible authorized offeror whose technically acceptable quotation is deemed to represent the lowest price. Offers that meet all of the above requirements will be deemed technically acceptable.</p>
<p>Quotations must be emailed to divya.soni@nist.gov.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.

The solicitation number is NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2011-103-DLM and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). 

The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-48 (January 31, 2011).  

The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 423690 and the size standard in number of employees is 100. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) and the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Disease program (TRND) a branch of the NIH Center for Translational Therapeutics (NCTT), to negotiate and award an order to Hamamatsu, 360 Foothill Road, Bridgewater, New Jersey 08807-2920 to procure the FDSS uCell System.

The sole source determination is based on the fact the National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nations leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting making medical discoveries that improve peoples health and save lives. The Laboratory of Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Disease (TRND), a branch of the NIH Center for Translational Therapeutics (NCTT), is requesting to purchase an additional CyBi-Well 384 channel simultaneous pipettor for low-volume, high precision liquid transfer. This duplicate instrument is needed to expand our capability to handle the existing protocols of compound library replication, dilution, and delivery to high-density format assays established by the NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC), a branch of the NCTT. The implementation of existing technology and protocols will ensure the highest levels of accuracy and experimental efficiency across all laboratories under the NCTT.   Additionally, the FDSS/uCELL is needed to facilitate a streamline transition in assay transfer and development between TRND and the NCGC laboratory. The TRND laboratory will work as a collaborative resource for drug development using existing and novel cell based assays, animal studies, and ultimately support of human clinical trials. The uCELL will be used in kinetic cell-based assay development, including GPCR and ion channel research, with capabilities of using existing protocols as well as newly established protocols transferred from the FDSS7000. 

The FDSS/uCELL is a small and affordable imaging plate reader used for kinetic cell-based assay development, including GPCR and ion channel research. The uCELL accepts plates in either 96 or 384 well format, and is equipped with a high-sensitivity Hamamatsu camera that images the entire plate simultaneously. The instrument has an on board disposable pipette head which is capable of delivering from 1 to 50 ul of liquid to each well. Plates can be measured before (baseline), during, and after liquid addition which allows one to measure cellular responses kinetically in real time. Many cell based assays (such as GPCR and Ion channel studies) exhibit rapid kinetics after compound addition and require an instrument with these properties. Furthermore, agonist/antagonist assays can be performed in the same run. The washing system enables tips to be reused several times.  The software allows users to quickly set assay parameters in a single protocol, which can be transferred to the FDSS7000 for kinetic screening in 1536 well format. Currently, the NCGC has in place several established protocols.  The uCELL will allow NHGRI to implement and scale up the established protocols into 384 or 96 well format. The gained sensitivity in 384 and 96 well format assays far out-weights the loss of throughput. Also, the ability of the uCELL to perform assays in 96 or 384 well format allows us to investigate new assay formats that we were unable to perform with the FDSS7000.  It is key to continue to have systems in place that are compatible, that is why we are requesting the FDSS/uCell from Hamamatsu in order to maintain ongoing protocols that must not be disrupted.

FAR Provisions which apply to this acquisition are:1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items (JUN 2008) 2) As stated in FAR Clause 52.212-2 (a), The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Commercial Items; 3) FAR Clause 52.212-4, (SEPT 2009) Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statues or Executive Orders Commercial Items, Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; and 4) FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition. The offeror must include in their quotation, hourly rate, the unit price, the list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<SUBJECT>Request For Information (RFI)  Letter Generation Systems
<SOLNBR>SSA-RFI-11-1005
<RESPDATE>021811
<CONTACT>Sean Frey, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109669446, Email sean.frey@ssa.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><br />Introduction:</p>
<p>This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Reference SSA-RFI-11-1005 when responding to this announcement. SSA is seeking responsible vendors that are capable of providing a centrally managed solution for letter generation.</p>
<p>At present, the Social Security Administration (SSA) uses printed and mailed letters for all formal and most informal communication with its various benefit recipients and business partners. Many disparate computer systems use different internally developed architectures to prepare these notices. Generally, these SSA computer programs offer several letter and paragraph libraries to create their substance and format. SSA staff sometimes hands these notices to its recipients in person, but more often, either the agency or a contractor centrally print them and deliver them by US Mail. The agency achieves customization through the selection of the letter type, paragraphs, fill-ins for paragraphs, and the inclusion of customized text.</p>
<p>SSA is conducting market research on how to consolidate its various letter generation systems and provide communications by methods in addition to US mail, such as, but not limited to, e-mail. Its goals are to reduce Information Technology (IT) and programmatic maintenance costs, increase communication management capabilities, reduce costs by using delivery means other than US Mail, and improve public service by offering additional communications options to SSA clients. SSA seeks information about IT products or services that might meet these goals.</p>
<p>The following subject headings are specific areas of interest to SSA. You must organize your response by these headings. Your response should address briefly how you propose to meet the requirements under each of these headings. It should include comparable examples of where your company has already applied the potential solution. The agency will not evaluate responses that are too long or poorly organized. For any of the headings, you may recommend solutions your company does not offer. SSA prefers but does not require a single managed solution. SSA prefers the use of commercially proven products and solutions. SSA prefers that options potentially owned or managed by SSA operate in a generic service-oriented web application server environment. Please identify hosting requirements and options for proposed solutions, including whether the solutions can be hosted as a service in third party facilities. SSA permits the offering of open source based products as long as commercial support for the open source product is also available.</p>
<p><br />Content Authoring and Management:</p>
<p>SSA requires a centrally managed solution for document language and template authoring, incorporating the ability to create, edit, collaborate, and publish approved document content in a centrally managed environment that will serve as single authoritative source for the agency. A potential solution must store content separately from formatting to render text as required by a variety of current and future delivery methods for communications. The content authoring facility must include the ability to manage content in multiple languages, initially in English and Spanish. Proposed solutions must include the migration of language used in its current systems into any future system. SSA currently has about 20,000 paragraphs and 5,000 templates. A potential solution must include content management and search facilities, and must maintain and track all versions of the same content eventually used for production purposes Also, it must provide a flexible language development environment to support the workflow of the collaborative SSA language development and release process. The design should provide a mechanism for detailed and customizable management information and reporting. <br /><br /><br />Content Composition:</p>
<p>SSA will continue its current practice of having separate business programs generate a selection of templates, paragraphs, fill-ins, tables, illustrations and free format text to serve as content for a new communication management system. These separate content generation programs are not a part of this RFI. A potential solution must provide a single uniform standards-based interface to serve as the interface between business programs and the communication management system. This interface must initially accept information (such as a specific name), and permit future use of data references (such as the location of a specific name) and separately executed communication business logic (such as a request to create an award letter for this specific person using this specific data instance). A potential solution must support multiple languages, both by receiving the request in the issuing language and in a neutral format with the content output created in the requested language. It must maintain detailed management information related to the source of communication requests, content selections, and volumes.</p>
<p><br />Content Rendering:</p>
<p>A potential solution must properly format the substance of the communication and render it for the target delivery mechanism. It may render the same communication at different times using various formats and delivery mechanisms. This implies a separation between content and format. Currently, SSA uses enclosures. While the agency will continue to use enclosures for interim letter production, it anticipates attaching the content of stuffers on demand without maintaining any inventory. A potential solution must render content using a variety of different markup outputs such as PCL, AFP, PDF and HTML. It must make content available for accessibility purposes, for example, in audio and Braille formats, and render communications on IT equipment that is Section 508 compliant. SSA currently produces about 350 million notices per year.<br /><br /><br />Communication storage:</p>
<p>SSA staff must have a historical record of the exact communication rendered and delivered. This includes the parameters used to generate the communication, when it was initiated and by whom, how and when it was delivered, and the delivery methods used. The potential solution must also allow for its reissuance by the same or different delivery mechanisms and formats. It must allow SSA staff the ability to run queries against stored notices to augment management information, perform other analytic and program management functions, and perform bulk actions on stored notices.</p>
<p><br />Content Delivery:</p>
<p>A potential solution must provide various delivery options using different formats and devices. Agency staff may personally hand printed material to a recipient or deliver it by US mail or other means. A potential solution should allow the agency to notify recipients electronically and through electronic repositories such as web sites. Electronic communications should be available both in plain text and encrypted. In most cases, SSA will send an unencrypted message to a customer notifying them that a communication is now available at a secure SSA web site. Authentication and encryption management are not part of this RFI; SSA will manage them separately. A potential solution must have the ability to automatically or optionally execute rerouting of undelivered items or other management functions. A potential solution must provide detailed management information related to delivery methods and outcomes. Many products which might support outbound communications initiated by SSA also support inbound customer initiated communications. Please describe any support for these customer-initiated communications.</p>
<p><br />Communication Notification Management:</p>
<p>Recipients of SSA communications should have interactive web based channels available, such as a web portal, to view available communications. These include communications previously issued, redelivery requests, and those with altered future delivery and selection methods. A potential solution should offer a subset of communication options using interactive voice response (IVR).</p>
<p><br />Conclusion:</p>
<p>Interested vendors must provide verifiable proof in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to meet the Agency's requirement, see URL site http://www.socialsecurity.gov/oag/acq/oagacq_508.htm. Any solution must be compatible with applicable Federal Government Section 508 standards. Vendors having the capability to meet the above requirements are invited to submit complete details. The responses shall clearly state the ability to meet the above requirements. Interested parties shall respond to this notice within 15 calendar days from date of this publication. Vendors shall provide the names and contact information of customers. References may be checked. Vendors responding shall indicate whether their services are available on the GSA Federal Supply Schedules. Pricing data may be submitted. This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the data received. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in SSA's assessment of capable sources. No Faxed responses. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. No formal solicitation is being issued at this time. Please submit electronic responses only to the contract specialist identified herein. NOTE: There is a size limit for e-mail: No submission shall be greater than 5 MB.</p>

<CONTACT>Neil M. Kern, Contract Specialist, Phone 5713452366, Email KernNM@State.gov - Kelly Bracey, Contracting Officer, Phone 703-875-6298, Email BraceyKM@state.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide local guard services at the U.S. Mission Tunisia. The Mission requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in this performance Work Statement (PWS). <br /><br />
<p>The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State intends to award a time and materials contract, with firm-fixed price and cost reimbursable elements, for local guard services, on behalf of the U.S. Mission Tunisia. The Government will solicit this requirement as a full and open competition using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The Government plans to award one contract as a result of this acquisition.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options, which shall be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government. The estimated number of annual hours for guard services at this location is approximately 264,940 hours.</p>
<p>All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract.</p>
<p>The Project Manager must possess a Level 3 English and Arabic language proficiency, which requires an ability to speak each respective language with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations on practical, social, and professional topics.</p>
<p>The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: the synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days. On or about February 15, 2011, the Government plans to post the solicitation. No paper copies will be mailed. The Government plans to conduct a Site Visit at the U.S. Embassy in Tunis approximately&nbsp;fifteen (15)&nbsp;business days after the release of the solicitation.&nbsp; Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit proposals. A contract is expected to be awarded within 120 days of proposal submission. All dates are subject to change.</p>
<p>The Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) period opens with the posting of the synopsis and ends&nbsp;ten (10) calendar days after the Site Visit. Offerors may inquire about security risks by specific countries during this period. The solicitation, when finalized, will be available on the Internet at www.fedbizopps.gov.</p>
<p>All announcements and amendments made to the solicitation will be posted at www.fedbizopps.gov. To receive updates, click on "Register to Receive Notification". Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to&nbsp;Neil Kern&nbsp;at <a href="mailto:KernNM@state.gov">KernNM@state.gov</a>. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>All proposals from responsible vendors will be evaluated if received on time. All prospective offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award. In accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the offeror who submitted a technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>

<DESC>Sole Source Justification

1.	The intended use of the material or service

Software maintenance contract for m+p international closed-loop vibration control software on a Windows machine.

2.	The critical or unique characteristics of the material or service which are mandatory for the intended use:

The software is used for experiment control in closed-loop vibration testing.   Testing is performed for qualification for space flight where a shaker system is driven by a computer using the software.  The software defines the vibration spectrum for random vibration, fixed sine wave, sine sweep, or shock testing.

3.	Reasons why only the selected source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion or all other sources.
 Please include proprietary statement from vendor or patent number:

The software is currently being used by NPS personnel and is tied to an existing computer and data acquisition system.  Data and test specifications have been defined using the software.  Because the software is proprietary, the data and test specification formats are not easily ported to any other similar software solution.
 
4.	Additional justification/comments: 
At the initial purchase of the software another software vendor found with a similar product was found, but the cost was much higher because of unnecessary features.
