Support equipment required for the RCEFS and IAFS systems required are AMATTS (Apache Magazine and Tank Transport System), HM025-200-31, Hose extensions HM025-087-3, RCEFS tanks HM029-007-221, RCEFS lift assembly HM029-200-221, fuel kits HM022-103-101, storage cradles HM025-300-11, IAFS Aviation Unit Maintenance (AVUM) Spares, and IAFS Aviation Intermediate Maintenance (AVIM) Spares. The proposed replacement solution must be compatible with the existing configuration of the AH-64 IAFS and RCEFS equipment.  The USG is seeking advanced capabilities to AH-64 Apache Helicopter.

The technical data associated with the Reduced Sizes of Crashworthy External Fuel Systems (RCEFS) and Internal Auxiliary Fuel System (IAFS) is not available due to the proprietary nature of the product; therefore, the USG is looking for alternative sources that can provide the same capabilities currently required to support the mission of the AH-64 Helicopter.  Responses will be used to determine the appropriate procurement method for this requirement.  <br>  <br> Responders shall provide their product's Technology Readiness Level (TRL) number and back it with evidentiary data.  Interested vendors are encouraged to provide substantiated evidence of their capabilities and successes in the areas cited above. <br>  <br> This RFI is issued solely for informational, market research, and planning purposes only.

All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S Government to form a binding contract.  It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) site for additional information pertaining to this RFI. <br>  <br> The submission should also include the following information: 1) Organization name, address, email address, Web site address, telephone number, and size and type of ownership for the organization; and 2) Tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability.  If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements. <br>  <br> The Government will evaluate market information to ascertain potential market capacity to 1) provide services/supplies consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice and otherwise anticipated; 2) secure and apply the full range of corporate financial, human capital, and technical resources required to successfully perform similar requirements; 3) implement a successful project management plan that includes: compliance with tight program schedules; cost containment; meeting and tracking performance; hiring and retention of key personnel and risk mitigation; and 4) provide services under a performance based service acquisition contract. <br>  <br> BASED ON THE RESPONSES TO THIS RFI NOTICE/MARKET RESEARCH, THIS <br> REQUIREMENT MAY BE SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES OR PROCURED THROUGH FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION, and multiple awards MAY be made. Telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions. <br>  <br> Interested parties who consider themselves qualified to perform the above-listed services are invited to submit a response to this RFI Notice by 20 April 2015.
