<DESC>The USDA, ARS, Southern Plains Area Office, College Station, Texas intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements with Kingaroy Engineering Works Pty Ltd, 2 Jarrah Street, Kingaroy Qld 4610 for a KEW Peanut Trailer Thresher. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) for Commercial Items.
<p>The USDA-ARS Cropping Systems Research Laboratory (CSRL) in Lubbock, Texas&nbsp;has established a program of peanut germplasm selection for improved tolerance to heat and water-deficit stress. This work is in parallel with ongoing projects at CSRL investigating the effects of conservation tillage and timed deficit irrigation on peanut production (collaboration with research projects at CSRL, USDA National Peanut Research Laboratory, Dawsen, Georgia and Texas Agrilife Research, Uvalde, Texas). The research projects are conducted on site as well as on numerous farms in the area (distances of up to 75 miles from CSRL). In previous years harvesting has been done by hand or with borrowed equipment. The projects have become large enough that neither of these options is feasible any longer. The minimum requirements are listed as follows. 1. End product shall contain less than 0.5% crop residue; 2. End product shall have less than 1% breakage; 3. Crop residue shall have less than 1% peanuts; 4. Pneumatic delivery of peanuts to bagging chute; 5. Peanuts can be collected in bags or grain trailer; 6. Crop residue is deposited away from the bagging chute to avoid contamination; 7. Thresher can be adjusted to compensate for: the moisture content of the crop, the density of sample and the ability of the operator to hand-feed a steady supply of sample into the machine; 8. Capable of being towed through agricultural fields; 9. Capable of being towed legally on public highways; 10. Double belt driven utilizing a slip clutch device to allow the threshing mechanism to start from zero while engine is running; 11. Gasoline powered engine.</p>
<p>The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact above not later than 15 days from the posting date of this notice. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. No RFP will be issued based upon this Notice of Intent. Interested parties may submit any information for consideration by the Government to Michael Douglas at the email address listed above with the solicitation number referenced in the subject line.</p>

<p>The MALD-J is an expendable unmanned air vehicle deployed from an F-16 fighter or B-52 bomber aircraft at standoff ranges to penetrate enemy airspace to stimulate, decoy, confuse, jam and/or saturate an enemy integrated air defense system to enhance aircrew survivability during combat operations. The only known responsible source that can satisfy these requirements is Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS) the original MALD producer and sustainment provider because it solely possesses the critical vehicle information and qualified vehicle design to meet Government's requirements. No Technical data package is available from the government. FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii) requires that all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. All responses must be received 15 calendar days after date of post. The AFFARS clause 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this procurement. The AAC Ombudsman is Colonel Charles S. Greenwald, AAC/CV, 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542, (850) 882-5495, Charles.greenwald@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>NASA intends to extend Contract NNA04CA76C with Planners Collaborative, Inc. on asole-source basis pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. Theobjective is to extend the performance period for five months consisting a two -monthbase period and three one-month option periods, while the Government AccountabilityOffice (GAO) considers a protest of award of the BOATS follow-on contract toDeltha-Critique NSS Joint Venture.The current Contractor provides support for users and occupants of Ames Research Centerunder Business Operations and Technical Services (BOATS). The principal purpose of thiscontract is to provide a variety of professional and para-professional functions tovarious divisions at NASA-ARC. The Contractor provides support for scientific andtechnical information, including video, photo, publications, printing and libraryservices; human resource management and training; acquisitions; equal opportunity andaffirmative action; commercial technology; public affairs and education outreach; legaloffice; and related administrative programs. This extension will allow for a continuationof services to ensure program continuity and critical mission support and avoidsignificant technical impacts while a competitive follow-on acquisition is completed. The extension will extend the period of performance of the current contract, NNA04CA76C,for a total period of five months, from July 1, 2010 through November 30, 2010, andincrease the contract value accordingly. The current contractor, Planners Collaborative,Inc. is considered the only contractor that can meet ARCs needs given the short periodof performance for the extension. Awarding a five month contract to another source, atthe same time as the recompetition of the follow-on is in process, would result insubstantial duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Governmentsrequirements and not allow for a sufficient phase-in period, thereby affecting thecontinuity of services and causing unacceptable delays in fulfilling ARCs requirements.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit theircapabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified pointof contact no later than 4:00 PM. PST on November 30, 2009. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed effort, based upon responses to this notice, issolely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Questions regardingthe extension can be sent via email to Starr L. Strong at Starr.L.Strong@nasa.gov. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The contract ceiling for the cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF)/firm-fixed-price (FFP) contract with Joint Venture Yulista Management Services Incorporated and Science and Engineering Services Incorporated (JVYS) in support of the Government Owned and Government Operated (GOGO) Larry O. Daniel Prototype Integration Facility (PIF), Redstone Arsenal, AL has been exhausted more rapidly than anticipated.  The US Army Contracting Command, AMCOM Contracting Center, anticipates a modification to Contract DAAH01-02-C-R190, to increase the maximum ordering ceiling as an interim measure until such time as a follow-on contract can be awarded.  The award of the follow-on contract is anticipated in May 2012.  The modification to DAAH01-02-C-R190 is necessary to maintain uninterrupted support for aviation, missile, and technology activities in the development, fabrication, integration, test and qualification of prototype tactical and ground support systems, subsystems and components.  Under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B), Only one Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Service Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, this contract modification shall be awarded on an other than full and open competition basis to JVYS.  Until a follow-on contract can be awarded, award to other than JVYS during this interim period will result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and will cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the PIFs mission to provide rapid acquisition, rapid response and rapid prototyping capabilities.  All responsible sources may submit a response which shall be considered.  All responses should be directed to Mr. Leslie E. Lancaster at leslie.lancaster@us.army.mil and must be received within fifteen (15) days of this notice. This notice of intent to issue a sole source modification to contract DAAH01-02-C-R190 is not a request for competitive proposals. This is not a formal notice of solicitation. Telephone or facsimile inquiries and/or responses will not be accepted. See Note: 22.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W911SE-09-R-0016.<br><br>Digital Video and Imagery Distribution System (DVIDS) is a state-of-the-art, 24/7 operation that provides a timely, accurate and reliable connection between media around the world and military units serving in both stateside and overseas.  The overseas locations include, but are not limited to Japan, The Horn of Africa, Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain.  United States Army Central (USARCENT) Public Affairs Offices (PAOs) is the proponent for Army DVIDS program for Central Command (CENTCOM).  The PAO recognizes the value of having access to the DVIDS network, as have agencies outside of CENTCOM, to include other Army commands and sister services.  As a result, an efficient means is needed to acquire and field new systems to meet future DVIDS network expansion plans.  There are currently approximately 150 terminal systems in the DVIDS network.  New SATCOM terminal acquisition projections is for from 25 to 100 systems in the base year and 25 to 75 additional SATCOM terminals in each of the four successive option periods, with end strength projected at 525 terminal systems by the end of FY13.  Each new system will be fielded with a set of common use/high failure spare parts, so customers may perform user and organization level repairs on-site.  Helpdesk support is also required to help resolve equipment operation concerns for customers deployed world-wide.  Maintenance support is needed to provide preventive maintenance (scheduled maintenance) and unscheduled maintenance for DVIDS SATCOM terminals which are now in use or will eventually be purchased.  Repairs for terminals currently in use require an individual purchase request to secure necessary maintenance service and repair parts.  Training for system operators and field maintenance technicians has always been essential to the success of the DVIDS network even though it is not included along with the purchase of each system, and therefore training will also be purchased under this acquisition.  Since PAOs using DVIDS SATCOM terminals are at CONUS and OCONUS locations, access to training on a flexible schedule is important.  Lastly, contractor travel to provide maintenance and deliver training is inherently necessary.  Equipment users were limited to standard customer support and limited warranty maintenance support.<BR><BR>PWS: <BR>2.0  REQUIREMENT.  The contractor shall provide the supplies and services specified herein in accordance with this PWS.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Battle Creek, Michigan VA Medical Center, 5500 Armstrong Road, Battle Creek, Michigan intends to negotiate with Volunteers of America- Michigan to provide services as part of its Community Based Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program.  The proposed action is for the HCHV program, which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one (1) source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The Government believes that only one (1) responsible source can provide the services that will satisfy the agency requirements.

The goal of the HCHV program is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or habitation unfit for Veterans and place them in community-based, residential environments with sufficient therapeutic services to meet the needs of those Veterans. Through the HCHV program, VA provides case management services to Veterans and facilitates their access to a broad range of medical, mental health, and rehabilitative services. The purpose of the solicitation will be to obtain proposals from contractors who can provide care, treatment and rehabilitative services to veterans suffering from serious mental illness, including veterans who are homeless, in community-based treatment facilities offering a safe and secure environment that supports their rehabilitation goals.  The Contractor will be required to provide therapeutic and rehabilitative services, but will not be required to provide detoxification or other hospital level treatment - those services will be provided by the VA at VA facilities.  Due to the urgent nature of this requirement, contractors will be required to demonstrate their ability to provide services within a 2-week period after contract award.  Initial contract awards are expected to be on or about June 25, 2010.

Statement of Work

A.	General Objectives and Requirements

Title of Project: Transitional Living Program

Purpose of Project:  This collaborative project will offer shelter, meals, employment related services, substance abuse referral, and referral to other services as needed, as coordinated by a case manager that address the causes and effects of homelessness in a community-based setting.  Requirements include provision of direct services in a safe, sober environment, which supports recovery and meets the needs of homeless Veterans.

Background Information: Volunteers of America Michigan (VOAMI) is the provider of three Homeless Programs for Veterans:  1) 18-bed Grant & Per Diem Program which provides transitional housing to homeless veterans for up to 24 months, and 2); 22-bed expansion Program which provides transitional housing to homeless Veterans for up to 24 months; 3) and a 16-bed Contract Residential Program which provides homeless housing for up to 6 months to severely mentally ill homeless Veterans as well as those Veterans who reside in homeless shelters and/or places not fit for human habitation.  This Program is uniquely designed to provide homeless housing to female Veterans as well as provide intensive case management services to homeless Veterans whose mental health is fragile.  Because the Homeless Programs are located on-site on the same campus it allows for an easy transition of Veterans from the Contract Residential Program to the Grant & Per Diem Programs, when clinically determined, which ensures continued engagement and easy transition of the Veterans from one level of care to another.   This set up is less disruptive to treatment and serves to ensure that the personal and community supports established by the Veterans are maintained and/or enhanced.

The service will be provided in the 18-bed facility managed by Volunteers of America Michigan (VOAMI) which currently service Berrien, Cass and Van Buren County veterans first then veterans come from other areas in Michigan and Indiana. 

Collaborating Agencies:  Volunteers of America Michigan is uniquely positioned, having developed partnerships with several community agencies to provide services to homeless Veterans.  Services include medical and disability services, Veteran benefits planning, life skills training, dental care, emergency shelter, support groups, money management techniques, substance abuse treatment, income entitlements, educational and employment training.  Volunteers of America-Michigan are located at the hub of homeless services for Berrien, Cass, and Van Buren Counties all of which are in the catchments area of Battle Creek Veterans Affairs Medical Center.  
	
B.	Scope and Methodology

Scope:   This collaborative partnership will provide services to homeless Veterans from the Berrien County and surrounding areas.  The services will be provided in the 18-bed facility managed by Volunteers of America-Michigan.  Collaboration with numerous area agencies will lend diversified support services.  

Referral Methodology:  Veterans eligible for the Contract Residential Treatment Program are those who are identified as being homeless.  This may include Veterans with a service-connected chronic mental health diagnosis (who must be accorded highest priority), Veterans with any service-connected disability, or Veterans with a non- service-connected disability.  These Veterans will be identified by the treatment teams working in the community, in shelters, in missions, or in the streets.

5.	Student Internship:  Student training at the MSW level is an important responsibility of    Social Work Service and the Battle Creek VAMC.  Our general objective is to ensure that our contract community partners provide comprehensive field work training for students   that will enable them to function with competence at the beginning level of their social work specialty.

6.	There shall be a one-to-one ratio of student to social worker to ensure that appropriate    clinical supervision is given to the student, and to ensure that appropriate clinical care is provided to Veterans.  Student training requires close cooperation between the school and the field agency. Together, the goal is threefold: 

a.	To develop attitudes that will enable students to think and act professionally.

b.	To develop knowledge which will enable students to think and act logically and systematically. 

c.	To acquire skills for transferring attitudes and knowledge into practice.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases has a requirement for advancing the development of new medical countermeasures against the biological agents that are most likely to be used in a terror attack on civilian populations.
<p>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) specifically focuses on supporting the development of promising biodefense therapeutic candidates/products or lead series with broad spectrum activity. The research and development activities supported through this BAA will allow candidate therapeutic countermeasures to progress through the product development pipeline toward licensure. The eventual goal is to enable the U.S. Government to stockpile these medical countermeasures to protect the American public.</p>
<p>Broad spectrum activity is a characteristic that enables a particular product to mitigate biological threats across a wide range or class of agents.  There are a number of traditional threats for which effective treatments are either non-existent, of limited usefulness, or vulnerable to both naturally emerging and intentionally engineered antibacterial and antiviral resistance. A limited number of anti-infectives with broad spectrum activity directed at common, invariable, and essential components of different classes of microbes could potentially be effective against both traditional and non-traditional threats. This approach would allow a small number of drugs to replace dozens of pathogen-specific drugs for emergency use. Additionally, strategies to overcome bacterial and viral drug resistance could extend the clinical utility of existing broad spectrum anti-infectives and have immediate benefits. Moreover, broad spectrum treatments directed towards host targets or human immunological responses to infection have the potential to be effective against one or more diseases.  For instance, targeting host receptors and cellular processes to treat infections and/or cellular intoxication can directly prevent or treat diseases. As well, targeting immune response mechanisms may be an effective way to reduce morbidity and mortality by controlling the host responses that contribute to disease or by non-specifically activating the host's natural immune defenses to induce a faster, more potent protective response. These approaches could provide clinical utility when used alone or in combination with conventional anti-infectives.</p>
<p>Broad spectrum therapeutics supported under this BAA are specified as the following classes: <br />&bull;	Broad spectrum anti-bacterial: Therapeutic with activity against more than one of the NIAID Category A, B and C bacterial threat agent AND including at least one of the following bacterial pathogens:  Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, B. mallei, and Rickettsia prowazeki. <br /> <br />&bull;	Broad spectrum anti-viral: Therapeutic with activity against more than one of the NIAID Category A, B and C viral threat agent AND including at least one of the following viral pathogens: Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Junin virus, Variola major, Dengue virus, Venezuelan encephalitis virus, Western Equine encephalitis virus, Eastern Equine encephalitis virus and human influenza virus.</p>
<p>&bull;	Host-directed broad spectrum therapeutic: Therapeutic directed at a host response thereby reduces morbidity and mortality from exposure/infection and is effective against more than one of the NIAID Category A, B and C bacterial or viral threat AND including at least one of the following bacterial and viral pathogens: Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, B. mallei, Rickettsia prowazeki, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Junin virus, Variola major, Dengue virus, Venezuelan Encephalitis virus, Western Equine Encephalitis virus, Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus and human influenza virus.</p>
<p>&bull;	Broad spectrum anti-toxins: Therapeutics with activity against more than one of the following toxins or activity against multiple serotypes of one of these toxins: Botulinum neurotoxin, Staphylococcus enterotoxin B, Epsilon toxin of Clostridium perfringens, and ricin toxin.</p>
<p>Offerors shall propose a well-defined product development path that must enable and include the completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial prior to or within a 5-year contract period of performance. The performance of studies in vertebrate animals and clinical studies must be consistent with all applicable Federal regulations and the DMID, NIAID, and NIH policies and guidelines for the conduct and oversight of research in vertebrate animals and human subjects. This solicitation will also support post-Phase 1 product development activities which are enabling for a biologic license application (BLA) or a new drug application (NDA), including: <br />&bull;	Manufacturing scale-up leading to consistency lot manufacturing. <br />&bull;	Phase 2 clinical trials. <br />&bull;	Animal studies leading to pivotal animal efficacy studies required to support licensure under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) "Animal Rule" (New Drug and Biological Drug Products; Evidence Needed to Demonstrate Effectiveness of New Drugs When Human Efficacy Studies Are Not Ethical or Feasible: http://www.fda.gov/cber/rules/humeffic.htm).</p>
<p>Plans for advancing therapeutic candidates/products or lead series through the product development path shall be proposed, implemented and funded in stages with specific decision gates and well-defined criteria for determining the merit and feasibility of advancing to the next stage. Offerors may submit proposals for more than one therapeutic candidate/product or lead series; however, a separate Technical and Business Proposal is required for each therapeutic candidate/product or lead series. If a single therapeutic candidate/product or lead series is being proposed for activity against more than one of the selected pathogens within the scope of this BAA, only a single Technical and Business Proposal is required.</p>
<p>Offerors are encouraged to apply state-of-art and innovative technological approaches and platforms in the development of the proposed broad spectrum therapeutics.  State-of-art and innovative technological approaches refer to capabilities, such as temperature stabilization or delivery method, that can be engineered into a wide array of existing and candidate products to enhance the product performance. Technological platforms, on the other hand, are standardized methods that can be used to significantly reduce the time and cost required to bring medical countermeasures to market.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement type contracts will be awarded on or about July 29, 2011.  The length of the project proposed by the offeror, should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research, but should not exceed 5 years.<br />The NIAID estimates that one to three contracts may be issued for a total cost of up to $17 million per year.  However, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s).</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.   This BAA will be available electronically on/about June 25, 2010, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

All capability statement/proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized clinical trials of hormone therapy (HT) were designed to determine whether HT had beneficial effects on health outcomes, especially cardiovascular health, in postmenopausal women. Women without uteri were randomly assigned to take one daily tablet containing either conjugated equine estrogens (CEE), 0.625 mg (Premarin, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), or a matching placebo (also provided by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals), and women with uteri were randomly assigned to take one daily tablet containing either CEE, 0.625 mg, and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 2.5 mg, (Prempro, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) or a matching placebo (also provided by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals). The WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) was an ancillary study (conducted with private funding) to the WHI and investigated the effects of CEE-containing HT on risk of probable dementia and any cognitive impairment and on changes in global cognition over time. WHIMS included 7,450 WHI participants enrolled at 39 of the 40 WHI clinical sites who were age 65 and older. Because WHIMS did not include detailed cognitive assessments of women without cognitive impairment, the WHI Study of Cognitive Aging (WHISCA) was designed as an ancillary study to WHIMS to assess memory and other domain-specific cognitive functions in women free of dementia. WHISCA included 2,305 WHIMS participants at 14 clinical sites and was conducted under contract number N01-AG-9-2115. The WHI and ancillary WHIMS and WHISCA studies were stopped earlier than planned for both the combination therapy (CEE+MPA in 2002) and CEE-Alone (in 2004) because these treatments increased health risks and did not protect against coronary heart disease. Although study medications were discontinued, follow-up assessments continued in WHIMS and WHISCA as well as the main WHI trials.</p>
<p>WHIMS and WHISCA were designed to test the hypothesis, suggested by results of observational studies, that HT had beneficial effects on maintenance of cognitive health in older post-menopausal women, reducing the risk for dementia and protecting against age-associated memory loss. Contrary to expectations, WHIMS showed that HT increased the risk for probable dementia and was associated with poorer global cognition, and WHISCA showed that CEE+MPA treatment was associated with poorer verbal memory over time and that CEE-Alone did not improve verbal memory. <br /><br />The WHIMS and WHISCA protocols have transitioned from face-to-face to less costly and more efficient centrally based and validated telephone interviews to assess cognitive functioning. The WHIMS Epidemiology of Cognitive Health Outcomes (WHIMS-ECHO) continues through 2010 as part of the current WHI extension follow-up (N01-WH-4-4221) and includes assessments previously performed through WHIMS and WHISCA evaluations. Up to 3,900 women are expected to participate in the WHIMS-ECHO study. <br /><br />In addition, the new, Women's Health Initiative Memory Study of Younger Women (WHIMS-Y), is underway, also funded under N01-WH-4-4221. In this study, the telephone-based WHIMS ECHO protocol is used to assess the long-term impact of random assignment to postmenopausal hormone therapy among women who were 50-54 years of age at the time they were initially enrolled into the WHI hormone trials. Hormone therapy continues to be widely prescribed for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Further, there remains a strong belief among basic and clinical scientists that HT begun during the peri- or immediate post-menopausal periods may bestow cognitive benefits and that the cognitive harm associated with HT in the post-menopausal woman occurs only when there is some pre-existing, sub-clinical disease and/or the aging brain is more vulnerable to the possible negative effects of hormones. WHIMS-Y takes advantage of the rich WHI cohort by adding critical information on the clinical treatment of peri-menopausal and early post-menopausal women and on potential mechanisms of action for how HT may affect cognition. <br /><br />Thus, by the end of the current WHIMS extension period (N01-WH-4-4221), cognitive data will be available for a large portion of the women who participated in the WHI HT, with longitudinal cognitive data on the women who were 65 and older at the beginning of WHI as well as an initial and follow-up assessment for women who were 50-54 at baseline. The proposed extension of WHIMS-ECHO and WHIMS-Y offers a unique opportunity to gain further insights into the antecedents of cognitive decline or stability, and further clarify the contributions of vascular disease in dementia. The ability to advance science by a systematic study of the predictors of decline or stability of cognitive health will be greatly enhanced by longer follow-up for up to 19 years. As the participants grow older, the proportion with cognitive impairment or dementia is expected to increase rapidly. Feasibility and cost will be explored with the offeror during negotiations.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>There are 2 objectives of this contract: Objective 1 - Continued surveillance of the WHIMS-ECHO cohort. The purpose of this objective is to investigate the long-term effects of HT on dementia risk and cognitive function in older postmenopausal women. This includes: a) Enhance statistical power to identify predictors of cognitive decline and cognitive resilience.; b) Continue assessment of the adverse effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy on cognition as these women pass through the risk period for accelerated cognitive decline and impairment; and, c) Continue to serve as a national resource on which to build ancillary studies in collaboration with the greater scientific community. Objective 2 - Continued surveillance of the WHIMS-Y cohort. The purpose of this objective is to investigate the long-term effects of early treatment with HT on cognitive health. This includes: a) To determine the later impact of HT when administered to younger, more recently menopausal women; b) To determine whether these effects differ from the adverse effects observed in older postmenopausal women; and, c) To investigate mid-life predictors of cognitive decline and resilience.</p>
<p>The proposed contractor is uniquely qualified to perform these services for the NIA based on the following considerations:</p>
<p>WHIMS, an ancillary study to the WHI, began as a privately funded study to investigate the effects of hormone therapy on risk for dementia and cognitive impairment within the context of the WHI clinical trials of hormone therapy. More recently, under an NHLBI contract, the proposed Contractor expanded these studies to include an MRI assessment of WHIMS participants (WHIMS-MRI) and to evaluate WHI participants who were randomized to hormone therapy between the ages of 50 and 54 years (WHIMS-Y). The proposed contract will provide continued surveillance of WHIMS participants to investigate long-term effects of hormone therapy on dementia risk and cognitive decline and will provide continued surveillance of WHIMS-Y participants to investigate long-term effects of hormone therapy in women exposed during early menopause. The proposed Contractor is uniquely qualified to conduct these studies as the WHIMS study began at Wake Forest University with private funding and the Contractor has developed and maintained the cohorts and procedures in the initial assessment periods.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS ACQUISITION WILL BE FUNDED WITH AMERICAN RECOVERY &amp; REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) FUNDS; AS SUCH THE AWARDEE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO SPECIAL REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR CLAUSE 52.204-11.<br />The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), Alaska Region (AR) is soliciting interest in construction/renovation of the NWS Nome family housing units in Nome, Alaska. Currently, NWS families occupy two 4-plex units. Each 4-plex contains four 3-bedroom dwellings at approximately 1,000 square feet per dwelling. Each 4-plex has an 8" thick reinforced concrete firewall separating each 4-plex into two 2-dwelling units. The existing 4-plexes were constructed in the 1960's, require excessive maintenance, are not properly insulated and do not meet NOAA housing standards. This Nome Family Housing project will convert these two 4-plex units into five dwelling units and five garages on the existing foundations. The dwelling units may be a combination of 2-bedroom and 3-bedroom compatible with NOAA and Alaska Region Housing standards. One of the 4-plexes has a full basement while the other 4-plex has a crawl space under most of the unit with a small basement area which contains a hydronic heat unit and water heaters for both 4-plexes. Structurally, the two 4-plexes are sound but require increased insulation, new roof, increased dwelling sizes relative to standards for 2-bedroom and 3-bedroom dwellings, a second bathroom in 3-bedroom units and garages all on the existing foundations. It will be necessary to phase this work to accommodate parties currently residing in the structures to be renovated. This action will be a 100% small business set-aside as a Design-Build construction/renovation project. The Request for Proposal (RFP) is planned to be released in early January 2010 with proposals due within 45 days (mid February 2010) and contract award by March 30, 2010. Each proposal will be evaluated for the best value concept proposed based on the following criteria provided in descending order of importance: Proposed Design, Past Performance, Corporate Experience, Schedule, and Management Approach. It is determined that price will be considered approximately equal in value to all of the technical factors combined. The total amount available for this project is $2,500,000. The successful bidder will coordinate with the NOAA project team to complete the design, including design reviews at 65%, 95% and final. Construction/renovation should begin in summer of 2010 and be completed no later than the summer of 2011.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF WORK:   Project is to prepare and update map of the Calabasas mission complex using modern mapping technology and to analyze the surface artifacts within the fenced compound (midden area) and produce report on findings.
Project is to prepare an updated map of the Calabasas mission complex using modern mapping technology and to analyze the surface artifacts within the fenced compound.  Real time kinematic GPS equipment should be used to be a base map so features can be mapped.  Planimetric mapping will be done to document natural and cultural features and topographic data will be collected to produce .5m-interval contour coverage.  The goal of the surface artifact mapping and analysis is to understand how artifacts are distributed across the site (within main fence enclosure).  For example, is there spatial patterning in artifact type and age or are there distinct spatial clusters.  The fenced area where artifacts are to be mapped measures 53.3m (175ft) by 53.3m (175 ft).  The location of individual artifacts will be mapped and analyzed in-situ using a grid system of other means of plotting provenience and GPS surveying instruments.  Some artifacts can be taken into the lab for analysis, but most will be returned to their original location.  Unusual artifacts or examples of diagnostics may be curated for a type collection.  Any curated artifacts will be housed at the NPS facility at the Western Archaeological and Conservation Center, Tucson, AZ.
The church structure itself is excluded from surface artifacts analysis.  All artifacts are to be analyzed for general type, function and age- including the Native American pottery which dates 1750 to 1870 AD, which should be differentiated as much as possible.  Analysis of Native American pottery is to include temper analysis and other non-destructive analytic means of describing, typing and dating the ceramics.  The report should include maps showing artifact types and distribution, and a section on ceramic analysis results. 
LOCATION:  The worksite is a detached unit of Tumacacori NHP located eight miles south of the main visitor center in the Rio Rico, off of Pendleton Road.  It is closed to normal visitation and accessed by an unpaved road that is in good condition.

<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Washington, DC conducts research, development and management support of Anti-Ship Capable Missile (ASCM) Counter Measures (CM) technology development projects. The CM technology development projects encompass a spectral range spread across the radio frequency (RF), millimeter wave (mmW), electro-optic (EO) and infrared (IR) portions of the spectral region. The goal of these projects is to improve the ASCM CM capabilities of the Fleet for both shipboard and airborne applications. With the development of advanced ASCM systems by potential adversaries, advanced CM technologies play an increasing role in protecting Fleet assets in both the blue water and littoral environments. NRL requires engineering expertise to evaluate the performance of technologies in areas which include, but are not limited to, off-board CM systems, including RF, mmW, EO and IR payloads. The application of advanced technologies will be evaluated and analyzed with hardware developments. These technologies will be assessed through laboratory and field tests to demonstrate and improve ASCM CM and sensor systems performance. <br />A detailed Statement of Work will be included in the solicitation when issued. A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type contract is anticipated. The period of performance for this effort will be a base year of twelve months, with four one-year options. The anticipated total level of effort is 100,000 hours, including the base year and four options, if exercised. The incumbent contractor is Envisioneering, Incorporated, 4485 Danube Drive, Suite 46, King George, VA 22485-5708, under Contract Number N00173-05-C-2048. It is anticipated that only one award will result from this procurement. NRL uses Electronic Commerce (EC) to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued.<br />Any resultant contract will be DO Rated under the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Through the rehabilitation of an historic federal building, this project continues the legacy of outstanding public architecture. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nations most talented designers and artists to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 to 100 years of service.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian federal employees; and gives public expression to our democratic values. In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural/engineering design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals and security requirements.  All projects will be LEED certified.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project is the repair and renovation of the Robert S. Vance Federal Building and U.S. Federal Courthouse located at 1800 5th Avenue North in Birmingham, Alabama.  The building maintains a prominent presence in the downtown financial / business district and is a local landmark and the historic symbol of the Federal presence in Birmingham.  The historic structure is a four story marble and brick Neo-Classical style building constructed in 1921 with two floors added in 1926 and is approximately 17 350 gross square meters (gsm) 174,000 gross square feet (gsf) without parking.  There are no interior parking spaces.  The existing courthouse will maintain a total of four (4) existing courtrooms: one (1) historic district courtroom and three (3) bankruptcy courtrooms.   The building will house portions of the District, Magistrate and Bankruptcy Courts; U.S. Attorney; U.S. Marshals Service; U.S. Probation; Senators Field Offices GSA and other federal agencies. This project will provide superior workplaces for civilian federal employees, and shall serve as an example of successful historic preservation while making a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the existing character of the building.  The design will follow the Secretary of Interiors Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Building Preservation Plan (BPP) guidance, respecting the existing historic character of the building while at the same time supporting the needs of a modern workforce.  GSA will contract separately during the design phase for Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services and Construction Manager as Agent (CMa) services.  The CMc and CMa will be active participants in the design process to provide (in addition to the A/E):  construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and functionality and constructability reviews.

SCOPE OF WORK
The facility will be designed using English units of measurement with soft metric units shown in parentheses.  The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural, landscape architectural, engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for clear and concise communication of the design intent to contractors who will construct the work.  The scope of work will require at a minimum:  metric design development drawings, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, value engineering services, life cycle costing, space planning, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and construction phase services (option to be exercised at a later date) for a facility that includes the renovations and alterations to the existing building and related systems, site development and parking, client program requirements, and sustainable features.  The facility must be designed to meet the energy goal established by GSA.  The design is also to include the GSA design standards for secure facilities; P100-Facilities Standard for the Public Buildings Services; the Courts Design Guide requirements; the U.S. Marshals design requirements, and any other agency specific guidelines as part of the design.  The design of the facility shall include sustainable design and construction practices following the LEED format with a requirement for Certification and will incorporate total building commissioning as defined by GSA design guides.  There will be a formal partnering process throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution through voluntary commitments to accomplish established agreed-upon project objectives by all involved parties to their mutual benefit.

This building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Each design submission must be approved by the Regional Historic Preservation Officer, who will coordinate external review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, in compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act, Section 106.  Design submissions will include a historic preservation report with captioned photographs and relevant design details identifying historic preservation design issues and solutions as they are developed.  Every effort will be made to avoid adversely effecting original materials and design in the buildings preservation zones identified in the Building Preservation Plan.  Alteration or removal of original materials and design elements requires special justification and a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the SHPO.  The selected A/E firm will assist GSA in obtaining any required MOAs.

SELECTION PROCESS
This is a request for qualifications (RFQ) of A/E firms/lead designers interested in contracting for this work. The A/E firm as used in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design. The Lead Designer is the individual or the team of designers who will have primary responsibility to develop the concept and the project design.  The Lead Designer will also be involved in commissioning an artist or artists for this project and in assisting with the successful integration of works of arts into the architectural design.

A/E firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed in the State of Alabama.  The A/E firm will address the contractual relationship with the lead designer and project team in Stage II.  At that time, the following specialty consultants will be required for security, fire and life safety, audio-visual systems, lighting, acoustics and water intrusion.

The A/E selection will be completed in two stages as follows: In Stage I, interested Lead Designers and associated A/E firms will submit portfolios of accomplishment that establish the design capabilities of the Lead Designer and design firm.  In Stage II,
shortlisted Lead Designer-A/E teams will be interviewed.

Stage I
All documentation will be in an 8 1/2" x 11" format.  The assembled content for the Stage I portfolio should be no more than 1/4 inch thick.  Submissions may be double sided where feasible.  The portfolio should include the following: a cover letter referencing the FedBizOpps announcement and briefly describing the firm and its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; Standard Form 330 Architect Engineer Qualifications Part II; credentials of historic preservation specialist; and responses to the submission requirements and evaluation criteria listed below.  An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer and representatives of the client and GSA will evaluate the submissions.  The board will establish a shortlist of three to six firms.

Identification of team members, other than the Lead Designer(s), is not required at this stage.  Consultant and production firm (if different from the design firm) information should not be included in the Stage I portfolio.

The U.S. Coast Guard requires a contracting vehicle to be in place that will allow us to have first right to use of facility as an ICP in an event of a Category 2 or more hurricane to hit the Gulf shore resulting in evacuation Lake Charles, Louisiana.  At least 96 hours prior to landfall of anything equal or greater than a Category 2 hurricane, an advance team will be deployed to this location to set up for eventual ICP stand up.  At 48 hours prior to landfall, a decision will be made to expand the operation, and more personnel will be arriving.  If a similar storm to Hurricanes Katrina/Rita hit the Lake Charles area, this will require that USCG MSU Lake Charles stay for an undetermined period of time, due to the inability to return to normal operations in the Lake Charles area.  MSU Lake Charles will be forced to reconstitute to full operations from this satellite location.  The requirements for the facility are as follows:  The ICP location needs to be at least 70 miles and no further than 120 miles North of MSU Lake Charles, Louisiana, located at 127 West Broad Street, Lake Charles, Louisiana.

One of the rooms must be able to accommodate approximately 2,000 square feet and the other three rooms must be no smaller than 120 square feet each.  The 2,000 square feet office space/conference room must be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 30 phone/fax lines and 20 internet connections spread out in the room.  The three smaller conference rooms (no smaller than 120 square feet each) must each be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 5 phone lines and 5 computer lines.  The Contractor must also have the flexibility to increase the amount of lines needed as the operation grows.  The facility shall be able to provide tables and chairs for at least 100 people.  The 2,000 square feet conference room must be able to accommodate or have the potential to have 10 electric outlets distributed throughout the room.  The other three smaller conference rooms must each be able to accommodate or have the potential to accommodate 7 electric outlets distributed throughout each room.  Up to 70 rooms may also be needed; therefore, the operational facility must be within walking distance (1/2 mile) from hotels that could accommodate this number of rooms.  Parking will be needed for up to 100 vehicles.  The office/conference facility should be near locations or have the capability to serve nutritious meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner and midnight rations (finger food) service.  The NAICS Code is 721110. The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 million.  The period of performance is anticipated for five-one year ordering periods commencing July 2010.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement to determine the interest, availability, and capability of HUBZone, 8(a) and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns that have an interest in submitting an offer on project JFSD200973 - Allied Support DGPS, TIGDL Antennas located at the Grand Forks AFB, ND. The project includes, but is not limited to the construction of the foundations for the DGPS and the TIGDL antennas. The foundations for the three DGPS antennas are concrete piers that will consist of an approximate 12 ft deep, 18 inch diameter concrete footing that will allow for the embedment of a 1-1/2 inch galvanized steel pipe. Fiber-reinforced polymer will be required in lieu of common steel reinforcement for the piers. The TIGDL antennas will require a 15 ft x 20 ft reinforced concrete pad (standard steel reinforcement is acceptable). A chain link fence with a double gate will be installed around the concrete pad. The DGPS and TIGDL antennas are located at different sites on base. Each of the antenna sites will require the installation of the necessary conduit to supply communications and power requirements. The period of performance is 60 days.<br />Should a Request for Proposal be issued, the magnitude is estimated to be between $100,000 and $250,000. The resultant contract awarded from any contemplated solicitation will be a firm fixed price contract.

<DESC>A.	General Information  

The Southwest Region will be standardizing Anesthesia Breathing Circuits.  This is a re-evaluation of this product group since the Regional Incentive Agreement has expired.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes Anesthesia Breathing Circuits for adult and pediatric patients.  The entire category of Anesthesia Breathing Circuits has an annual demand of over $110,000.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, Cardinal, currently serving the Southwest Region. 

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program and obtaining a DAPA please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is November 2010.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.   The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

B.	Products & Performance Required
 
The Southwest Region is seeking product line items in the category of Anesthesia Breathing Circuits.  The product category includes Anesthesia Breathing Circuits for adult and pediatric patients.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $110,000. This is a re-evaluation of this product group.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  

At the request of the Southwest Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C. Instructions to Vendors

If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address, your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and product literature to cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil no later than July 1, 2010.  Submissions must be received by COB, 5:00 PM PST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  If your product literature is more than 4MB in size, please mail your product literature to:

Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN 
Tri-Service Regional Business Office - Southwest Region 
34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 
San Diego, CA  92134 
Phone:  (619) 532-8517

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D.	Evaluation Criteria

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.
Vendors will be required to provide detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and product literature. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The TPRB will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM PST, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree and 5 = Strongly Agree.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally and individually. The evaluations are conducted in a clinical setting.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Clinical/Performance Criteria
1.	The light weight corrugated and expandable tubing is of adequate length and retains memory when extended for ideal positioning.
a.	Clinicians require the product to resist cracking, ripping, and tearing; expand to allow for a turn of 180 degrees; and retain memory for ideal positioning.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting by use of the product on at least (3) patients.
c.	Evaluator will open/remove product from packaging, easily extend the tubing into proper position, and check for any signs of cracking, ripping, or tearing; observe that the tubing retains its memory and that it extends to allow the operating platform to be turned at least 180 degrees.

2.	The soft, air-inflatable cushion of the mask is ergonomically designed, has a clear body for superior view, and has an inflation valve that allows the cushion to be easily adjusted to provide a safe and comfortable fit.
a.	Clinicians require that the product is engineered with a secure-fit air cushion mask to provide an optimal seal with minimum pressure.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product on at least (3) patients.
c.	After applying the mask securely over the mouth and nose with the adjustable strap, the evaluator will examine for any leakage.

3.	The products single limb swivel connector eliminates kinking problems and helps reduce torque at the patient end.
a.	Clinicians require that the product effectively prevents kinking problems, making repositioning of the circuits easier.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the product on at least (3) patients.
c.	The evaluator will examine the swivel connector with the naked eye and determine if there is any torque or kinks.

4.	The product is easy to set up and connect to the anesthesia gas machine and endotracheal tube.
a.	Clinicians require that product come in a complete kit reducing the necessity to gather and assemble extra components and that the tubing is easy to connect to the gas outflow of the machine and the patient.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in a clinical setting by use of the product on at least (3) patients.
c.	The evaluator will open/remove products from the packaging without having to assemble any of the components and attach to the anesthesia gas machine and endotracheal tube.  Evaluator will observe the ease of performing the task.


Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

<SUBJECT>Passive Acoustic Monitoring of North Atlantic Right Whales, in the Southeastern US, for NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Service
<SOLNBR>NFFN7600-10-12294
<RESPDATE>061710
<CONTACT>Charlene A. Yaple, Phone 816-426-7531, Email charlene.a.yaple@noaa.gov
<DESC>United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Central Region Acquisition Division, (CRAD) is soliciting sources for the refurbishment of one existing auto-buoy package and construction of an additional buoy and monitoring of both buoys while they are deployed in waters off Jacksonville, FL during November 2010 to April 2011, for the Passive Acoustic Monitoring of North Atlantic Right Whales in the Southeastern United States.
<p>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 is responsible for the management of marine mammal population. The agency is mandated to conserve the endangered species under its jurisdiction and must undertake actions to prevent further decline of populations, facilitate their recovery and safeguard the quality of their habitat. The population of right whales in the western North Atlantic is highly endangered. NOAA Fisheries is proposing to continue a program to utilize autonomous passive monitoring devices to gather data on the presence of right whales in the southeast United States. The objectives of this project are as follows: 1. to deploy two passive acoustic auto-detection buoys northern Florida and Georgia to collect data on calving right whale vocalizations during the 2010/2011 winter calving season. 2. Simultaneously deploy autonomous recording buoys at the same locations to provide a continuous record of right whale sounds. The buoys will be deployed during a six-month period beginning in November 2010. 3. The monitoring system will provide near real-time notification of right whale detections delivering data to land stations at least every four hours.</p>
<p>The passive acoustic monitoring units require the following capabilities: (1) the ability to record sounds in the frequency of right whale contact calls to digital media for underwater deployments of at least six (6) months. (2) Buoyant housings that can withstand water pressures at depths greater than 100 feet and sufficiently rugged to survive the high wave energy experienced on the Southeast Atlantic continental shelf during winter months. (3) On-board systems to automatically identify right whale acoustic calls and notify land-based stations through cellular or satellite phone communication. (4) Equipment necessary to communicate with land-based systems for display and monitoring of right whales contacts.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NOAA may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Interested firms shall provide, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; detailed descriptive literature of the products that it has provided previously for the same or similar effort, and a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications to supply the required passive acoustic monitoring units and a system to archive and disseminate collected data which will be considered by the agency. Responses can be faxed to Charlene Yaple @ 816-274-6977 or sent via email to Charlene.A.Yaple@noaa.gov.</p>

<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The mission of the Bureau of Administration s Office of Language Services (A/OPR/LS) is to ensure the efficient and accurate delivery of language services in support of the President of the United States (POTUS), Vice President of the United States (VPOTUS), White House Staff, senior leadership of the Department of State (DOS) and senior officials of other federal agencies through communication with non-English speaking governments and persons by means of interpretation (spoken word) and translation (written word). The current Legacy system cannot meet the Department's mission because it is not capable of communicating across various software programs, causing redundant data entry and inability to replicate data; not able to track contractor availability, track assignment status and manage documentation across divisions and units (hampering in-house collaboration) and store documents</p>
<p>In order to increase efficiency and streamline the large and ever-increasing workload at the State Department's Office of Language Services (LS), a new Enterprise management system will be developed that will integrate the currently complex and often disparate translation management and interpretation assigning processes of the office into a single solution. This solution will have a common interface enabling customers, project managers, contracted resources and other staff to access to the appropriate capabilities within the system. This solution will enable improved efficiency, reduced paper usage, higher transparency, while also extending automation to both customers and contracted resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The translation management tool will include:<br />1. An Integrated workflow for both Translation Memory (TM) management, Terminology management, cost estimates, billing, invoicing, travel, work order authorization management, credentialing.<br />2. The ability to track/view translator / interpreter availability in real-time: So that the project managers (PM) / Assigning Officer know when and how many resources are available.<br />3. The ability to send out jobs offers and jobs from within a single PM interface: Automation of the assigning process.<br />4. An offline option for translators / interpreters.<br />5. The ability for clients to initiate their own projects as well as download the finished product on their own.<br />6. The ability to use existing projects as templates for new projects.<br />7. Tracking of translator / interpreter job progress by PM's/Assigning Officer/Client in real-time.<br />8. The ability to alert PM / Assigning Officer of other past/current projects on same/similar subject, suggestion of best Translators / interpreters for subject matter based on criteria of choice.<br />9. A central web server-based Translation Memory (TM) option for the translator: All users using the same TM simultaneously, both internal and external.<br />10. The ability to create highly customized workflows, including transcriptions<br />11. One centralized database for PM / Assigning Office data as well as translation / interpretation data<br />12. The ability to allow translators / interpreters to view jobs and self-assign available projects.<br />13. A complex word-count functionality.<br />14. The ability to create automatic cost estimates<br />15. Automatic billing component<br />16. Offer 24x7 first tier technical support with a 4-hour maximum response time.<br />17. Automatic file-naming convention for each project: File management<br />18. The ability to allow contract resources external to DOS network to manage their profile, contact data, schedule availability, accept jobs, receive materials, submit finished materials, participate in project workflows and submit invoices.</p>
<p>ARCHITECTURE<br />For the new system to be successful it must fall within the following architectural guidelines:<br />&bull; The solution must be Section 508 Compliant<br />&bull; The application must be entirely web-based (Net Centric) with no client-installed software required.<br />&bull; The solution must be able to run in a fully virtualized environment with a separation between the application server and database server.<br />&bull; The database platform must be SQL Server 2005 on Windows Server 2003.<br />&bull; The web application platform must be on a Windows Server 2003 server, and can leverage either Internet Information Services (IIS), or Apache Tomcat to serve up the actual web application.<br />&bull; The solution must be able to function in a clustered environment including both a multi-node database failover cluster and a multi-node application failover cluster.<br />&bull; The application must store all file based data on the file system - no systems that leverage Binary Large Object Storage (BLOBS) will be accepted.<br />&bull; The solution must be pre-certified via a successful Independent Validation and Verification (IV&amp;V) scan<br />&bull; The solution must support Secure Socket Layer (SSL) communications<br />&bull; The vendor must be willing to consider all customizations as part of their product and ensure that all future versions/upgrades of their product will work with the customizations.<br />&bull; The solution must be able to support up to 65 concurrent internal users, and up to 100 concurrent external users; total of 165 internal and external users.<br />&bull; The solution must provide a fully functional Application Programming Interface (API).<br />&bull; Must pass security certification and accreditation (C&amp;A) - Moderate.</p>

<p>POC<br />Peter Kontakos<br />Contract Specialist<br />(617) 494-2602</p>
<p>Description<br />The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, is conducting a sources sought notice for the following potential requirement:</p>
<p>Background<br />The U.S. Government established the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to provide a safe, secure, and efficient aviation system that contributes to national security. Among its many responsibilities, the FAA manages and operates the National Airspace System (NAS), which comprises over 59,000 facilities located throughout the nation supporting all air operations within the U.S., as well as certain oceanic areas. In order to manage the considerable environmental and safety issues associated with NAS operation, the FAA must comply with a set of federal, state, and local environmental and occupational safety and health statutes, regulations, executive orders and directives. In order to meet these compliance challenges, the FAA administers an Environmental, Occupational Safety and Health (EOSH) program, which spans a range of compliance management areas.</p>
<p><br />In order to support the EOSH program, the Volpe Center will implement fall protection safety upgrades to facilities in the Eastern Service Area (ESA). The Volpe Center will perform pre-work surveys and fall protection upgrades at Remote Communications Air to Ground (RCAG), Remote Transmitter/Receiver (RTR), Remote Communications Outlet (RCO), and Back Up Emergency Communications (BUEC) sites. These upgrades may include any or all of the following: removal/replacement and/or installation of ladders, ladder safety climb systems, hatch door modifications to suit safety climb systems, and guard-rail, mid-rail, and toe board extensions.</p>
<p>Tasks to be Performed</p>
<p>a. Remove and discard existing ladder safety climb system<br />b. Install Dyna-Glide Climbing Protection Systems in accordance with attached installation manual <br />c. Install the 4" toe board around the perimeter of the platform. The toe board may be installed in one (1) of two (2) ways, bolting or welding in-place.<br />d. Install guard rail extension in accordance with the guidance drawing provided. The minimum height of the guard rail shall be 42" above the platform deck.<br />e. Install tower hatch-door counterweight balances, if required.<br />f. Re-preserve all disturbed areas using zinc-enriched epoxy paint (gray in color) prior to leaving the site. The disturbed areas shall be properly prepared for painting in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.</p>
<p>*Optional Tasks<br />a. Remove and replace existing tower ladder system. Discard existing removed material.<br />b. Modify the existing deck, as needed, to allow a climber to ascend through the deck hatch and stand on the platform prior to unhooking his safety climb system.<br />c. Remove and reinstall mid-guard rail if it does not meet half way between the platform deck and upper guard rail.</p>
<p>*Optional tasks will be determined during the initial site visit</p>
<p>Equipment Required<br />Dyna-Glide Installation manual for equipment required to install the safety climb system</p>
<p>Personnel Required<br />Two (2) persons shall be required to make an installation to a fixed vertical ladder. One (1) person (the "climbing installer") shall climb and install the rail sections one (1) at a time. The second person shall be on the ground (the "ground person") and shall deploy materials to the climbing installer.</p>
<p>The climbing installer and the ground person must both be trained, certified and experienced climbers versed in safety at heights, including rescue procedures in accordance with the fall protection standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Unless there are other personnel at ground level who are trained and equipped for rescue, the ground person must be prepared to immediately effect a rescue operation. This includes wearing the proper equipment at all times and having means of calling others for emergency assistance. If the climbing installer and ground person switch roles to spell each other off, then both must be equipped, trained and fit to assume the duties and responsibilities of both roles. The Contractor shall have a viable Rescue System on-hand during the work.</p>
<p>All capability information shall include: Contract number; Customer (DOD agency, other Government agency, private industry); Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) name, telephone and fax numbers; contract value and type of contract; period of performance; and description of product/services. Information provided should be detailed in the area(s) above so the Government can assess the ability of the company to provide the described services. All of the information sought should be conveyed in no more than 10 pages. Page size is set at 8&frac12; X 11 and text should be doubled spaced. Each response must reference the sources sought title. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 332312 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. Interested parties must respond to this announcement in writing within 15 days of publication. Telephonic requests will not be honored. All responses must be sent to Peter Kontakos, Contracting Officer, RVP-31, United States Department of Transportation, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, 55 Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02142.

Geological Survey, Central Region, Biological Resource Division, CBI, PO Box 25046, MS 302, Denver, CO 80225 has a requirement to update the taxonomy, synonyms in common use, common names, native status and gross distribution in ITIS to reflect recent updates in the taxonomy of Moths, Mammals,and Birds. These updates will comprise the editing and or addition of no less than 120 species. The data will also be suitable for integration with the Natureserve database: Biotics.
 Based on information available, and in accordance with 41 USC 253 (c) (1) and as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1) (i),  the USGS considers this requirement to be a sole source to NatureServe, 1101 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22209. NatureServe data on threatened and endangered species cannot be released to third parties by agreement eith the state Heritage programs because of exact locality data would further endanger the organisms and violate various state laws, and policies in many cases.

However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish these services may submit a capabilities statement to the USGS contract specialist, P. O. Box 25046, MS 204, Denver Federal Center, Denver, Colorado 80225-0046, Attention: Gail Walker, no later than June 23, 2010 at 3:00 p.m. Mountain Time.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (not a pre-solicitation notice pursuant to FAR Part 5) to determine the capability of potential sources and the availability of commercial sources pursuant to FAR Part 10.  

This notice is issued by the U.S. Coast Guard Shore Infrastructure Logistics Center, Norfolk, VA to identify sources capable of providing all labor, materials, equipment, and personnel necessary to support U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen, PR aviation training program.  

The contractor will be responsible for providing and operating a vessel in support of the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen, PR aviation training program.  As such, the contractor shall provide a vessel and all necessary management supervision, personnel, labor materials, fuel and equipment required for supporting helicopter crew hoists, rescue swimmer operations, and any aerial delivered material used to fulfill the Air Stations training requirements.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  The U.S. Coast Guard anticipates soliciting and awarding a contract for a base plus four option years, if exercised by the Government, beginning upon award. 

The area of operations will be mutually agreed upon by both parties, which may be no greater than 10 NM of the shoreline and within a 30 NM radius of Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen (approximately from between Mayaguez, PR, and Arecibo, PR); operating in the Aguadilla Bay vicinity is preferred.  

Typically the contractor will be required to provide services two days per week.  Operations will typically be conducted for on scene periods of two hours during periods scheduled between 0600 and 2300 local time.  The Coast Guard will provide specific times for services and the specific on scene location within the area of operation a minimum of 24 hours in advance.  Additional training periods may be conducted at a greater frequency to accommodate surge training requirements on a schedule mutually agreed upon by the parties.

Vessel Description:  
The vessel shall be no smaller than 34 feet and no longer than 65 feet in length and shall have at least a 10 foot beam. The maximum draft of the vessel shall not exceed 4 feet. Gross vessel weight shall be a minimum of 8 tons.

Other Characteristics:  The vessel must be capable of easily recovering personnel from the water.  The minimum required speed for the vessel is 0 knots or "dead in the water".  The vessel must have the endurance to maintain 10 knots transit speed for a minimum of 3 hours; 15 knots for 3 hours desired.  The vessel must be capable of maintaining a heading of +/-10 degrees at 5 knots while operating under a large helicopter producing 90 knots of rotor downwash in varying sea states and winds.  An extremely shallow draft vessel is undesirable due to drift characteristics when subjected to rotor downwash.  The vessel must have no permanent structures protruding higher than 20 feet above the water line which cannot be quickly stowed (e.g., antennas).

Required Deck Area:  The minimum deck area is 58 sq ft on the aft (fantail) portion of the vessel to allow two crew members to safely conduct operations.  The deck area must be free of all obstructions.

Vessel Equipment:  The vessel shall have, at a minimum, all equipment required by law including a fathometer, VHF-FM multiple frequency capable 2 way marine radio with specified frequencies/channels (13, 16, 21, 22, 23, 81, 83) and minimum ranges (20NM), a cell phone for secondary communications to the Air Station Borinquen Operations Center, GPS, and a long distance high beam search light. 

Safety Equipment:  The vessel shall be outfitted with a contractor furnished first aid kit and approved Type III personal flotation devices for crew and passengers.  The contractor shall provide helmets, goggles, and grounding rods for use by crew members during helicopter hoisting operations.

Required Docking/Mooring Facilities:  The contractor will be responsible for providing docking/mooring facilities for their vessel.  The vessel shall be located within a 45 minute transit time from the geographical areas of operation.

Vessel Maintenance:  The contractor shall operate and maintain the vessel, all equipment and systems in accordance with the original equipment manufacturer's technical manuals and specifications, United States Coast Guard regulations, and any applicable federal, state, and/or local regulations. 

A solicitation will be issued shortly and will be synopsized on the FedBizOpps Electronic Posting System at www.fedbizopps.gov.  It is the potential offer's responsibility to monitor this avenue for release of any future solicitation or synopsis. 

The applicable NAICS Code is 488390 (Other Support Services for Water Transportation) with a size standard of $7.0 million.  For the calculation of annual receipts and number of employees see parts 121.104 and 121.106 in SBAs Small Business Size Regulations, http://www.sba.gov/tools/resourcelibrary/lawsandregulations/index.html

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the US Army  Warfighter Science, Technology and Applied Research Directorate (WARSTAR), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Merrimack College, North Andover, MA 01845.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. <BR><BR>RESPONSES WILL BE RECEIVED FOR FUTURE REQUIREMENT CONSIDERATION ONLY.<BR><BR>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) requires technical and theoretical expertise to support ongoing internal research on (a) how lateral differences in tympanic membrane temperature and individual differences in hand preference can be used as physiological and trait-like markers of neuronal activity, emotional andlor physiological arousal, and verbal and spatial memory; and (b) how unilateral stimulation and bilateral saccadic eye movements can be used to influence cerebral activation, emotional andlor physiological arousal and cognitive processing abilities. Specifically, we need an expert in physiological and trait markers of cerebral activity, and in mechanisms that can be used to alter neuronal activation, in order to aid in the detection and reduction of the negative impact of high arousal states on the processing of verbal and spatial information. This individual must be capable of working with NSRDEC researchers to plan and conduct a series of empirical studies, and of using the results of this work to inform strategies for the attenuation of cognitive decrement caused by high emotional and/or physiological arousal in Soldier performance. Once established, physiological and trait markers of neuronal activity, along with mechanisms for changing neuronal patterns of activation, can be used to develop strategies for minimizing the negative impacts of emotional and/or physiological arousal, including aggressive arousal, on verbal and spatial information processing.<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>Professor Ruth Propper and her Brain & Memory Laboratory at Merrimac College are uniquely suited to provide the services described above. Professor Propper is an internationally-renowned expert in how communication between the hemispheres of the brain organizes cognitive processes, and how individual differences such as <BR>handedness and laterality affect attention, decision making, problem solving, and memory. Professor Propper directs the leading laboratory in the nation for the study of how cognitive processes are organized around different patterns of activity within and communication between the left and right hemispheres of the brain. For instance, Professor Propper and her colleagues have researched the influences of handedness differences on spatial and non-spatial memory gathering, representation, and application. They have also conducted and published a multitude of studies examining how performance on various tasks differs when rapid saccadic eye movements are present versus when they are absent. Indeed Professor Propper is the pioneer of the influential applied and theoretical examination of how rapid saccadic eye movements affect the integration of information between the two brain hemispheres. This work uniquely spans the often disparate domains of basic academic theoretical research and relatively applied government and institutional research, making her the top candidate to support the work being performed by NSRDEC. Further, Professor Propper has a successful track record with the timely completion of milestones and deliverables on prior contractual obligations with NRDEC (i.e., W911QY-09-P-0567). Finally, her work is published in top-tier scientific journals, receives wide attention across institutions and disciplines, and is very highly respected. We can find no other cognitive scientist with Dr. Propper's unique expertise and track record of successful, high-value research with an applied focus on the how individual differences affect the gathering and representation of verbal and spatial information.<BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>In preparation for this request we sought to identify cognitive scientists with expeliise in brain interhemispheric communication, individual differences, and episodic and semantic memory. Though several academic researchers were found who specialize in human brain function, Dr. Propper was the only scientist with significant experience and success in investigating how to facilitate these brain functions in normal adults. Further, she is one of the only scientists who examine such issues with a particular focus on how mitigation techniques can be developed<BR>to facilitate brain interhemispheric communication, patiicularly amongst individuals with low baseline levels of communication. Dr. Propper is backed by over a decade of academic experience, has been intemationally recognized and funded for her research, holds dozens of peer-reviewed publications within her domain of expertise, and is the only scientist who is well-suited and qualified for the present work.<BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR><BR>While Dr. Propper was selected for the reasons above, we note that this research will involve require access to facilities, equipment and test subjects. It is imperative that the institution be located within a distance suitable for local travel. Merrimac College fulfills this requirement as well.<BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>There are no actions the Natick Soldier Center can take to remove or overcome barriers to competition.<BR><BR>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: steve.streeter@us.army.mil no later than 5:00 PM (EST) on June 15, 2010.<BR><BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center -  Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Steven Streeter, Contract Specialist (508) 233-5704<BR>steve.streeter@us.army.mil<BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI): Ultrasound Tomography Device to Assess Sound Speed as a Measurement of Breast Tissue Density
<SOLNBR>RFI-NCI-100107-TG
<RESPDATE>062510
<CONTACT>Terry Galloway, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-402-4509, Fax 301-4024513, Email gallowaytl@mail.nih.gov - Caren N Rasmussen, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 402-4509, Fax (301) 402-4513, Email cr214i@nih.gov
<DESC><strong>General Information:<br /></strong>This Request for Information (RFI) is intended to provide source material for a state-of-the science summary of technology and methodology available for performing ultrasound tomography of the breast with validated technically supported algorithms to measure sound speed as a measure of breast tissue density. The unit should be associated with a clinical research program that performs mammographic screening of a racially diverse under-served population. This RFI should not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Federal Government, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the NCI. The NCI does not intend to award a cooperative agreement, grant, or contract on the basis of responses to this RFI or to otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the Government's use of such information. <br />
<p><strong><br />Purpose:</strong><br />The responses to this RFI may guide the NCI in awarding future contracts at an undetermined time to conduct epidemiological translational research related to assessment of breast density. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME; no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Request for Information notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>This notice is for market research only. The NCI is specifically interested in determining the types of organizations available in the marketplace that provide these technologies. In particular, the NCI is seeking qualified small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) which provide these technologies]. Based on the responses received from this announcement, an acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside.</p>
<p><strong>NAICS Code and Size Standard:</strong><br />In the event a Request for Quotation (RFQ) is issued, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334510 - Electromedical and Electrotherapeutic Apparatus Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees is being considered.<br /><br /><strong>Background: <br /></strong>The Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) has a longstanding interest in breast cancer epidemiology, including risk assessment, breast imaging and radiology, assessment of breast biology and translational and management issues related to breast cancer, including its prevention, detection and treatment. Breast density has emerged as one of the strongest identified independent risk factors for breast cancer, apart from age and gender. Density is a modifiable risk factor. Notably, drugs such as tamoxifen, which are effective in both treatment and prevention of breast cancer, are known to reduce breast density.</p>
<p>Currently available technologies for measuring density that are widely used clinically are technically limited. Mammographic density is limited by its reliance on a two-dimensional image and its variation with instrumentation, settings and breast compression. Furthermore, mammography exposes the breast to ionizing radiation which may itself increase cancer risk and requires precautions to protect medical personnel; therefore, it is unsuitable for testing younger women or performing short interval repeat examinations for research. Magnetic resonance imaging can provide a volumetric density measurement, but it is an expensive technique that requires substantial expertise and special housing to limit exposure to magnetic fields. Accordingly, we wish to assess the availability of low-frequency ultrasound technology devices that are suitable for assessing young women and for performing closely timed repeated examinations without substantial risk. The device should not require breast compression and must provide three-dimensional tomographic images of breast parenchyma. The device should provide an objective quantitative measurement of a physical quantity such as sound speed, which is correlated with breast density. Finally, the device must achieve excellent precision such that comparisons across serial examinations performed over time can be used to distinguish density changes related to specific interventions from random fluctuations.</p>
<p><strong>Information Requested:</strong></p>
<p>I. General Information - contact information, including name, institution / organization, telephone and fax numbers and e-mail address; website URL</p>
<p>II. Equipment, software, and system capabilities requirements</p>
<p>Information is sought regarding ultrasound tomography devices for breast imaging that reliably measure tissue density as a physical parameter such as sound speed. The device must be installed in a clinical research environment that performs mammographic screening of a racially diverse under-served population and should have been validated by comparison to other techniques for measuring breast density.</p>
<p><strong>The NCI seeks information regarding the following:</strong></p>
<p><em>Ultrasound tomography devices for breast imaging with the following characteristics:<br />1. Automated scanning of the breast from chest wall to nipple;<br />2. Low-frequency ultrasound waves (e.g., &lt;2 MHz) with a short exposure time (e.g., &lt;2 minutes) that do not pose a threat to health of patients or medical personnel working in proximity to the apparatus;<br />3. Easily operable with minimal training;<br />4. Capable of producing three-dimensional breast images interpretable by radiologists or others with expertise in interpretation of breast images;<br />5. Performance data related to detection of breast masses;<br />6. Supported by algorithms for calculation of sound speed as an objective quantitative measure of breast tissue density;<br />7. Validation of ultrasound measurements by demonstrating correlation of volume averaged sound speed throughout the breast to percent mammographic density estimated as an area using validated methods applied to film and digital mammograms;<br />8. Validation of ultrasound measurements by demonstrating correlation of volume averaged sound speed throughout the breast to volumetric assessments of tissue composition based on magnetic resonance imaging;<br />9. Evidence that device achieves good precision with repeated testing; <br />10. Strong technical support for application of analytical algorithms;<br />11. At least anecdotal evidence of use to assess changes in density in response to clinical interventions such as administration of drugs for treatment or prevention of breast cancer.</em></p>
<p>Please provide information regarding the location of the ultrasound tomography device and the demographics of the population where the device is used. Access to a clinical facility using this ultrasound tomography device is required. The clinical facility should have the following characteristics:</p>
<p><em>1. Physical proximity to a mammographic breast imaging center;<br />2. Performs mammographic breast cancer screening in a racially diverse under-served population;<br />3. Related to a clinical research unit that includes experienced study coordinators, physicians with translational research experience and interests and supported by scientists with expertise in ultrasound technology, radiology and analytical algorithms for computing sound speed and breast density;<br />4. Demonstrated capacity to recruit study subjects, including minority subjects, to participate in studies requiring interviews, donation of biological specimens and radiological examinations;<br />5. Interaction with a pathology department that can support research including collection of fixed and frozen breast tissues for investigational assays.</em></p>
<p>Additional comments relevant to this RFI, and addressing issues that are not specifically mentioned above, are also encouraged.</p>
<p><strong>How to Submit a Response:</strong><br />Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement for this requirement not to exceed 10 single sided pages including all attachments, resumes, charts, etc. (single space, 12 point font minimum) that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above.

<DESC><p>RECOVERY - THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009 (ARRA), PUBLIC LAW 111-5. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO X-NTH INCORPORATED, 2601 WESTHALL LANE, MAITLAND, FL 32751, UNDER GSA SCHEDULE GS23F0120P.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS POSTED TO CORRECT A NOTICE THAT WAS POSTED UNDER WC133010SE0110MOD0001 ON 05/21/2010. CONTRACT NUMBER OF THE PREVIOUS POST SHOULD HAVE BEEN WC133010NC0110MOD0001.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), posts this notice of intent to issue Modification 0001 against Contract Number WC1330-10-SE-0110 in order to add funding for additional supplemental professional engineering support services and extend the period of performance through 09/30/2010. <br /><br />In May 2009, NOAA awarded a delivery order, number WC1330-09-NC-1177, through competitive process, to X-NTH Incorporated against GSA Schedule GS23F120P. X-NTH Incorporated was tasked to develop an architectural and engineering Program of Requirements and cost estimate for the NESCC. X-NTH Incorporated delivered the Program of Requirements dated September 30, 2009. The current requirement for the development of the conceptual design and updating of the Program of Requirements is essentially follow-on work to that X-NTH Incorporated performed on delivery order WC1330-09-NC-1177. The information X-NTH Incorporated gathered from the research they conducted to produce the Program of Requirements is an essential component for expediting the development of the conceptual design package, updating the Program of Requirements and meeting the schedule for operation deployment in 2011. To consider sources other than X-NTH Incorporated would be inefficient and could compromise the Government's ability to meet the operation deployment schedule. A Contractor other than X-NTH Incorporated would need additional time to acquire the knowledge necessary to fully understand the Government's requirements to the point that they could begin work on developing the conceptual design and updating the Program of Requirements. Thus it is in the Government's best interest to acquire the follow-on work from X-NTH Incorporated.<br /><br />This Concept Design is required to provide an entry level design for the purposes of procuring a Developer/Contractor to build out a facility to meet NOAA's High Performance Computing needs. The estimated value of this action is approximately $400,000.00. The scope of this delivery order falls into two phases, Concept Design and Supplemental Engineering Services. The description of task objectives will be conducted in two phases as follows:</p>
<p>Phase One: Concept Design</p>
<p>The Contractor shall develop a Concept Design to include Concept Drawings, Concept Specifications, a Design Narrative, Concept Cost Estimate, and update the Program of Requirements dated 09/30/2009.</p>
<p>Phase Two: Supplemental Professional Engineering Services</p>
<p>In addition to providing Concept Design, NOAA requires the Contractor to provide Architect/Engineering (AE) and specialized technical services on an as needed basis over a period of six months. The Contractor shall provide professional engineering services to assist the Government in resolving any technical issues and in performing special design analysis.</p>

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R & D Maintenance Services, Inc, W91278-09-C-0020, Operation & Maintenance of Government Owned Facilities<br><br>Using Recovery Act funding, the Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-09-C-0020, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Tennessee Tombigbee Waterway, Alabama and Mississippi, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., 409 N. Main, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  The Contractor will make emergency repairs to the exterior walls to stop penetrating water.  Location: Waterway Management Center in Columbus, Mississippi. Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated. This existing contract must be used because:  1) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed cannot be fully determined prior to removal of old materials.  2) This contract enables work to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facility is exposed to the elements thus minimizing the impact on the staff and the visiting public. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation , and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed-price (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.  Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number RFQ-008-43YK-10 is issued as a request for quotations and incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through FAC 2005-40. The NAICS code applicable to this acquisition is 334516. This procurement is unrestricted.<br />The new 306 research project needs an instrument to measure the thermal properties of food and feed samples. A scanning differential calorimeter will provide this fundamental information. The instrument should be capable of operating at atmospheric pressure and at elevated pressures. Detailed requirements for this device are listed below:
<p>Specifications</p>
<p>Temperature Accuracy: &plusmn;0.1&deg;C<br />Temperature Precision: &plusmn; 0.05&deg;C <br />Pressure Capability: 1 Pa to7 MPa absolute (0.1 to 1,000 psi)<br />Pressurizing gases: Inert (e.g., nitrogen, helium, argon), oxidizing (e.g., air; oxygen)<br />Calorimetric Precision: (&plusmn;1% based on metal standards) <br />Maximum Calorimetric: 1.0 micro Watt <br />Sensitivity: Dynamic Range: +/- 250 milli Watt<br />Dynamic Purge Gas: Up to 200 mL / min (cell flow rate)</p>
<p>Pressure cell</p>
<p>Cell must be capable of operating in a dynamic purge mode, controlled pressure mode, and constant volume mode.</p>
<p>Cell must be capable of operation as a standard DSC at atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>Cell should not require connection to any external fluid reservoir (e.g., water).</p>
<p>Cell must have protection against over-pressurization.</p>
<p>The operating cell pressure must be available as a separate stored signal.</p>
<p>Instrument Features</p>
<p>DSC instrumentation should be of the "Heat Flux" design whereby the sample and reference are measured in the same furnace, on separate stages.</p>
<p>The DSC should employ area temperature detectors directly beneath the sample and reference positions.</p>
<p>The DSC furnace shall be constructed of silver, with platinel heater windings for uniform thermal environment and long furnace lifetime.</p>
<p>DSC Cell design must permit manually operated quench cooling to subambient temperatures at atmospheric pressure using appropriate coolants (e.g., ice, liquid nitrogen etc).</p>
<p>Purge gas is pre-heated prior to entering the sample chamber and sweeps across sample for optimal purge interaction with sample.</p>
<p>The DSC must communicate with computer/controller through an Ethernet interface.</p>
<p>The data files must contain measured sample temperature, not calculated temperature to provide the actual sample temperature during different heating rate experiments.</p>
<p>The software must provide up to five points for temperature calibration.</p>
<p>The operator must be able to start and stop an experiment from the instrument module (local control).<br /><br />Calibration constants are stored in module memory so that if power fails the user does not have to repeat the calibration.</p>
<p>Software</p>
<p>The data analysis software must have the ability to perform kinetic analysis using any of three models: Isothermal, Borchardt &amp; Daniels, and Variable Heating Rate (ASTM E698).</p>
<p>The instrument software must be capable of performing a series of auto-diagnostic tests, either manually or through a scheduling component. These tests should verify the performance of instrument components such as electronic boards, mass flow controllers, etc. The software must also be capable of sending automatic communications as to the status of these tests so that the operator is fully apprised of their status.</p>
<p>The operating software should be capable of periodically and automatically checking for updates via an Internet connection, and downloading/installing those updates if desired.</p>
<p>Instrument software must provide ability to modify a run in progress, including the ability to add segments to an active run.</p>
<p>The data analysis software should be unkeyed, to allow for unlimited installations within one site. The data file format should easily allow sharing/transfer of data files as individual electronic documents, which are readable by the same data analysis package. The data analysis program should also include a .pdf generator, for the efficient export of analyzed plots.</p>

<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The Gaylord National Hotel is the only hotel capable of meeting the requirements of the AFMA-hosted Chief of Staff Team Excellence Awards (CSTEA) conference. The requirements of this conference are for a large ballroom, meeting room space, breakout rooms and refreshments. Additionally, each nominated team is required to make a live presentation to a panel of GO/SES judges on 11-13 September 2010. They are also required to set up a exhibit booth at the AFA National Convention to share their success stories with others per AFI 36-3868 18 Mar 09, Chief Staff Team Excellence Award, Paragraph 100., "Each team will be required to set up a display booth in a designated exhibit area to share their success stories with others. Each team will be provided an 8 X 10-foot is (booth) funded by AFMA, for their display." These exhibit booths are required to coincide with the AFA National Convention held on 13-15 September 2010. The AFA has chosen the Gaylord National Hotel as the official location for their event.&nbsp; As a result of AFA bookings at the Gaylord National Hotel, and due to the limited capacity of hotels in the general vicinity of the Gaylord National Hotel to meet the requirements of AFMA's CSTEA, it is determined that no source other than the Gaylord National Hotel can meet this requirement.</p>

<DESC>Massive numbers of video clips are generated daily on many types of consumer electronics and uploaded to the Internet. In contrast to videos that are produced for broadcast or from planned surveillance, the "unconstrained" video clips produced by anyone who has a digital camera present a significant challenge for manual as well as automated analysis. Such clips can include any possible scene and events, and generally have limited quality control.
<p><br />Analysts who must work with such data are overwhelmed by its volume and lack of tools to probe it. Most current software tools that work with large collections of video clips focus on skimming to speed up the eyes-on-video/ears-on-audio process. Some advanced tools focus on automatic transcription and indexing of the speech from the audio signal. Other advanced tools apply computer vision techniques to extract features for unstructured "bag-of-words" search methods or to find clips that are "similar" to others. No technology currently exists to provide a user with the information necessary to fully understand the content or temporal processes within these data.</p>
<p>The ALADDIN Program seeks to combine the state-of-the art in video extraction, audio extraction, knowledge representation, and search technologies in a revolutionary way to create fast, accurate, robust, and extensible technology that supports the multimedia analytic needs of the future.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for&nbsp;commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br /><br />The solicitation number for this requirement is NTSB-R-10-0017. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This requirement is issued under full and open competition. The associated NAICS code is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Equipment Manufacturing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong><br />The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent Federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant accidents in the other modes of transportation -- railroad, highway, marine and pipeline -- and issuing safety recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Materials Laboratory is a division of the Office of Research and Engineering primarily dealing with the failure analysis of transportation system components. In some instances, the identification of organic materials through chemical analysis is required. In the past, this analysis was accomplished through the use of outside laboratories. This method was costly, time consuming and requires shipping or accompanying the sample evidence to a third party. A Fourier transform infrared spectrometer would allow the Materials Laboratory to identify organic substances in-house and would provide analysis information in a timelier manner. The instrument would also give investigators the flexibility to develop testing protocols and procedures that are specifically applicable to the needs of the investigation rather than trying to adapt to another laboratory's methods. The requested instrument is a new technology to the laboratory.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Description of Requirement</span></strong><br />To accomplish these tasks, the NTSB has a requirement to procure:<br />Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 1: &nbsp;One (1) Fourier Transform-Infrared spectrometer. <br /><br />The spectrometer must meet all of the following requirements:<br /><br />(1) Signal to Noise (S/N) ratio. Instrument must provide a S/N ratio of at least 40,000:1 (peak to peak; 4 cm-1 transmission measurement, 1 minute scan).<br /><br />(2) Resolution. Instrument must provide wavelength resolution to at least 0.1 cm-1.<br /><br />(3) Instrument wavelength range must be at least 12,500 cm-1 to 240 cm-1, depending on the source, beamsplitter and detector selected, for flexibility with changing workload.<br /><br />(4) Source. The source must provide stable, high intensity energy output in the mid-IR range. The source must be air cooled. It must be user replaceable.<br /><br />(5) Interferometer. The instrument must use a frictionless interferometer design to provide precision and linearity, free from wear between contacting surfaces without the requirement of an external air supply. The interferometer must have dynamic alignment to ensure the stability of the interferometer by keeping the interference conditions continually optimized during measurement.<br /><br />(6) Detector. The standard detector must be a thermoelectric-cooled temperature stabilized DLATGS (Deuterated triglycine sulfate doped with L-alanine) detector to provide a more sensitive signal with less electronic noise. The detector must be user replaceable. For future flexibility, detectors in the far-IR and near-IR ranges must also be available from the same manufacturer.<br /><br />(7) Beamsplitter. The beamsplitter should be constructed of potassium bromide (KBr). To protect the beamsplitter from fogging over time due to high humidity conditions, the instrument must provide a sealed and desiccated environment within the optical compartment. To allow flexibility in the future, the instrument must have the capability of easy user-changeability of the beamsplitter with automatic alignment. Other types of beamsplitters must also be available from the same manufacturer.<br /><br />(8) Automatic Accessory recognition. The instrument must be able to recognize and automatically set instrument parameters for commercially available accessories (e.g. self identifying technology).<br /><br />(9) Self-Diagnostics. Automated on-line diagnostics that allow the user to troubleshoot potential problems must be provided.<br /><br />(10) Software. Software must be able to recognize and set instrument parameters automatically for the source or detectors that are installed. Software must be Windows XP compatible and be able to export spectra into an open file format (i.e. JPG or TIFF) as well as a Microsoft Excel readable format. Software must have data processing and manipulation capabilities such as spectrum addition, subtraction, baseline correction, smoothing, wavenumber/wavelength conversion and atmosphere correction. Software search capabilities must be compatible with commercially available libraries/search engines such as Sadtler. User library creation capability must be supplied.<br /><br />(11) Microscope. A microscope must be supplied from the same manufacturer which will easily interface with this instrument. The microscope must meet the following requirements:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Capable of transmission and reflectance modes;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Inlet for gas purge;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT-A detector;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) Minimum 15X infrared optics;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e) 4X optical objective;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f) Binocular tube with adjustable eyepieces;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (g) Adjustable (translatable/rotatable) infrared apertures;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (h) Equipped with a digital camera capable of still image or frame&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; capture&nbsp;in&nbsp;a non-proprietary file format (i.e. jpg, tiff, bmp, etc.);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Be compatible with the microscope accessories indicated below.<br /><br />The following accessories must also be included: 1) Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) accessory and 2) Microscope ATR objective. The specifications for each accessory are listed below.<br /><br />The ATR bench accessory must have:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Material. The ATR accessory must have a diamond crystal. Due to the <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wide variety of substances that will be analyzed, the diamond crystal&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;provide durability, chemical inertness and scratch resistance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Volatile material cover.<br /><br />The microscope ATR objective must conform to the following requirements:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Slide-on type objective for switching between ATR, reflectance, and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transmittance modes<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Silicon crystal.<br /><br />(12) Warranty. A warranty must be provided for the equipment. Proposals shall address the standard warranty provided for the equipment. The NTSB anticipates at least a one-year warranty.<br /><br />(13) Maintenance and Support. Maintenance and support must be provided for the equipment. Proposals shall describe maintenance and support, including the means and frequency by which maintenance and support is provided for the equipment and details addressing recalibrating the equipment. The NTSB anticipates maintenance and support under this contract for up to four 12-months option periods after the end of the initial one-year warranty purchase.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Deliverables</span></strong><br />&bull; The contractor shall deliver and install a FT-IR spectrometer with all accessories outlined above within 90 business days after award to:<br /><br />NTSB Materials Laboratory <br />490 L'Enfant Plaza, SW, <br />Washington, DC 20594.<br /><br />&bull; At delivery, the contractor shall demonstrate the operation and function of the instrument and accessories and show compliance with the SOW requirements above to the satisfaction of all members of the Materials Laboratory staff (approximately 9 staff members).</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS: It is the policy of the USCG to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-9131), ATTN: Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, United States Coast Guard, 2100 2nd St SW STOP 7112, Washington, DC 20593-7112; FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>Another question has come up in reference to clarification of the following SOW. Please ensure that everything that is require a cost is applicable to your pricing and please total up your cost in all of the pricing remember your pricing should come from GSA schedule 70.


Question:

Approximately 15 - 35 USAOs relocate or undergo major renovations each year.  Offices can range in size from a small branch office servicing as few as four (HOW DO YOU GIVE A COST ESTIMATE IF THIS IS UNKNOWN)or five users to entire headquarters offices supporting several hundred users.(AGAIN SAME SITUATION)  Some relocation tasks are very large efforts and some are small but all relocations are complex, requiring extensive planning, solid analysis and effective cost control. All require coordination and the ability to meet the needs and schedules of the USAOs. The contractor must be prepared to execute, often on short notice, the relocations or cable requirements in the specified time frame to ensure that no delay in the USAO project schedule occurs.

Contractors cannot price the above statement because its not clear as to size. Quantify which one are small and which ones are large cant price because its undetermined. Should the contractor give a cost for 15 or 30 its unclear. I want to ensure that we are doing apples to apples and everyone is on the same sheet of music as to what is required.


Answer: 

Suggest using 1 large city say West Coast 1 Med city ( East) and 1 overseas site.. doesnt really matter the site or the drop numbers as long as everyone prices the same site/equipment and drops

So say for example
LA    Site consisting of expansion of 3 floors with 1 IDF ( which means a RACK and fiber to the MDF, and  Patch Panel(s))
Say 250 drops V and D
Longest drop 282 ft  Fiber run approx 153 feet thru chase in internal to USAO space telephone closet Avg drop length is 122 feet
IDF has 200 drops going to 2 racks in IDF 1 V and 1 Data.  Need 2 96 port patch panels and another 24pt.
All drops are run thru conduit above ceiling .
I dont know off the top of my head if union labor is required in LA.. I am guessing it is.  you know than do the same for 2 other diverse places and see what the cost for doing them are

<DESC>Amendment #1 to combined synopsis/solicitation W912L9-10-T-0035<BR>This amendment supplements the original Synopsis/Solicitation to clarify questions from vendors regarding W912L9-10-T-0035. The following information supersedes conflicting information on the base document and will be incorporated into the SOW.<BR>1). Total requirement is for 42 shower heads. Vendor may divide these shower heads into as few separate units as possible to reach this total. (For example, 6 units of 7 shower heads, 3 units of 14 shower heads&)<BR>2).This is a short term lease of shower units. The period of performance is as stated on the solicitation.<BR>3). Vendor may substitute shower trailer units at their discretion as long as the units satisfy the based requirements as stated in SOW and this document.<BR>4). See attached photos for specific site conditions and utilities tie-ins. Some minor repositioning may occur when units arrive at the direction of the authorized government representative (site mayor). This individual will be identified by the Contacting Officer prior to shower units arrival at Jennings County Fairgrounds.<BR>5). 20 Amp/110 volt electrical is available.<BR>6). Due to site layout and demand on electrical system, propane heating is required for hot water recovery rate. <BR>7). Water tie-in is standard garden hose diameter; therefore we require an additional water distribution source. In the past, we have used a 20 foot container with water heaters, recovery tank (water reservoir to meet the demand and offset the garden hose capability). A larger water hookup is available (hydrant with regulator and step-down), but the vendor should include this requirement in their base bid if they cannot provide the additional water distribution.<BR>8). Showers will operate continuously during the period of performance. Response to mechanical/equipment failures should be resolved within 1 hour of notification from Mayor Cell. Vendor will provide cell phone contact information for mechanical/equipment failures.<BR>When submitting bid, vendor must acknowledge receipt/consideration of Amendment #1 in total bid pricing.<BR>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for&nbsp;commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.<br /><br />The solicitation number for this requirement is NTSB-R-10-0017. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This requirement is issued under full and open competition. The associated NAICS code is 334516 Analytical Laboratory Equipment Manufacturing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></strong><br />The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent Federal agency charged by Congress with investigating every civil aviation accident in the United States and significant accidents in the other modes of transportation -- railroad, highway, marine and pipeline -- and issuing safety recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Materials Laboratory is a division of the Office of Research and Engineering primarily dealing with the failure analysis of transportation system components. In some instances, the identification of organic materials through chemical analysis is required. In the past, this analysis was accomplished through the use of outside laboratories. This method was costly, time consuming and requires shipping or accompanying the sample evidence to a third party. A Fourier transform infrared spectrometer would allow the Materials Laboratory to identify organic substances in-house and would provide analysis information in a timelier manner. The instrument would also give investigators the flexibility to develop testing protocols and procedures that are specifically applicable to the needs of the investigation rather than trying to adapt to another laboratory's methods. The requested instrument is a new technology to the laboratory.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Description of Requirement</span></strong><br />To accomplish these tasks, the NTSB has a requirement to procure:<br />Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) 1: &nbsp;One (1) Fourier Transform-Infrared spectrometer. <br /><br />The spectrometer must meet all of the following requirements:<br /><br />(1) Signal to Noise (S/N) ratio. Instrument must provide a S/N ratio of at least 40,000:1 (peak to peak; 4 cm-1 transmission measurement, 1 minute scan).<br /><br />(2) Resolution. Instrument must provide wavelength resolution to at least 0.1 cm-1.<br /><br />(3) Instrument wavelength range must be at least 12,500 cm-1 to 240 cm-1, depending on the source, beamsplitter and detector selected, for flexibility with changing workload.<br /><br />(4) Source. The source must provide stable, high intensity energy output in the mid-IR range. The source must be air cooled. It must be user replaceable.<br /><br />(5) Interferometer. The instrument must use a frictionless interferometer design to provide precision and linearity, free from wear between contacting surfaces without the requirement of an external air supply. The interferometer must have dynamic alignment to ensure the stability of the interferometer by keeping the interference conditions continually optimized during measurement.<br /><br />(6) Detector. The standard detector must be a thermoelectric-cooled temperature stabilized DLATGS (Deuterated triglycine sulfate doped with L-alanine) detector to provide a more sensitive signal with less electronic noise. The detector must be user replaceable. For future flexibility, detectors in the far-IR and near-IR ranges must also be available from the same manufacturer.<br /><br />(7) Beamsplitter. The beamsplitter should be constructed of potassium bromide (KBr). To protect the beamsplitter from fogging over time due to high humidity conditions, the instrument must provide a sealed and desiccated environment within the optical compartment. To allow flexibility in the future, the instrument must have the capability of easy user-changeability of the beamsplitter with automatic alignment. Other types of beamsplitters must also be available from the same manufacturer.<br /><br />(8) Automatic Accessory recognition. The instrument must be able to recognize and automatically set instrument parameters for commercially available accessories (e.g. self identifying technology).<br /><br />(9) Self-Diagnostics. Automated on-line diagnostics that allow the user to troubleshoot potential problems must be provided.<br /><br />(10) Software. Software must be able to recognize and set instrument parameters automatically for the source or detectors that are installed. Software must be Windows XP compatible and be able to export spectra into an open file format (i.e. JPG or TIFF) as well as a Microsoft Excel readable format. Software must have data processing and manipulation capabilities such as spectrum addition, subtraction, baseline correction, smoothing, wavenumber/wavelength conversion and atmosphere correction. Software search capabilities must be compatible with commercially available libraries/search engines such as Sadtler. User library creation capability must be supplied.<br /><br />(11) Microscope. A microscope must be supplied from the same manufacturer which will easily interface with this instrument. The microscope must meet the following requirements:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) Capable of transmission and reflectance modes;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Inlet for gas purge;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) Liquid nitrogen-cooled MCT-A detector;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) Minimum 15X infrared optics;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (e) 4X optical objective;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (f) Binocular tube with adjustable eyepieces;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (g) Adjustable (translatable/rotatable) infrared apertures;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (h) Equipped with a digital camera capable of still image or frame&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; capture&nbsp;in&nbsp;a non-proprietary file format (i.e. jpg, tiff, bmp, etc.);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Be compatible with the microscope accessories indicated below.<br /><br />The following accessories must also be included: 1) Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) accessory and 2) Microscope ATR objective. The specifications for each accessory are listed below.<br /><br />The ATR bench accessory must have:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Material. The ATR accessory must have a diamond crystal. Due to the <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wide variety of substances that will be analyzed, the diamond crystal&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will&nbsp;provide durability, chemical inertness and scratch resistance.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Volatile material cover.<br /><br />The microscope ATR objective must conform to the following requirements:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) Slide-on type objective for switching between ATR, reflectance, and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transmittance modes<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) Silicon crystal.<br /><br />(12) Warranty. A warranty must be provided for the equipment. Proposals shall address the standard warranty provided for the equipment. The NTSB anticipates at least a one-year warranty.<br /><br />(13) Maintenance and Support. Maintenance and support must be provided for the equipment. Proposals shall describe maintenance and support, including the means and frequency by which maintenance and support is provided for the equipment and details addressing recalibrating the equipment. The NTSB anticipates maintenance and support under this contract for up to four 12-months option periods after the end of the initial one-year warranty purchase.<br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Deliverables</span></strong><br />&bull; The contractor shall deliver and install a FT-IR spectrometer with all accessories outlined above within 90 business days after award to:<br /><br />NTSB Materials Laboratory <br />490 L'Enfant Plaza, SW, <br />Washington, DC 20594.<br /><br />&bull; At delivery, the contractor shall demonstrate the operation and function of the instrument and accessories and show compliance with the SOW requirements above to the satisfaction of all members of the Materials Laboratory staff (approximately 9 staff members).</p>

<p>This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-10-Q-200032 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>This solicitation documented and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-41. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted solicitation.

<p>This requirement is for spare parts for the HH65 USCG Aircraft.</p>
<p>The estimate quantity/parts list is attached in both PDF and Excel to be used to submit your quote.</p>
<p>Award will be made to the offeror(s) proposing the best value to the Government considering technical capability, price, delivery and past performance.

Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance and traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems. Alternate parts must satisfy all form, fit, and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard HH-65 aircraft.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a Certificate of Conformance in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. Certificate of Conformance must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>There are multiple Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) associated with the parts contained within this solicitation. Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to a manufacturer, manufacturer's COC, FAA 8130, and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on U.S. Coast Guard aircraft. Prospective vendors who are not the OEM or an authorized distributor must provide traceability for the offered product back to the manufacturer or authorized distributor. Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Factor 1- Technical Capability (based on acceptability of FAA/equivalent certification).<br />2. Factor 2- Price<br />3. Factor 3- Delivery<br />4. Factor 4- Past Performance (based on reference checks and/or historical performance record(s).<br />Technical Capability is the most important evaluation factor. Price is the second most important evaluation factor. Delivery is the third most important evaluation factor. Past Performance is the least important evaluation factor. The closer the offers are to equality, price becomes the most important.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

Destination (Nov 1991)<br />52.242-13 Bankruptcy (Jul 1995)<br />FULL TEXT CLAUSES<br />52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters. <br />CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010) <br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- <br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- <br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ] , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); <br />(C) Are / are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; <br />(D) Have [ ] have not [ ] within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. <br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. <br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). <br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. <br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. <br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <br />(End of provision)<br />52.209-7 Information Regarding Responsibility Matters. <br />INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010) <br />(a) Definitions.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) 0 Are, 0 are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) 0 Have, 0 have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) 0 Are, 0 are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) 0 Have, 0 have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>Alternate I (Oct 2008). When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i) and (l) for those in the basic clause. <br />(a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. <br />(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. <br />(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.<br />(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the "hourly rate" for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit.

If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert &lsquo;None'."] <br />(2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert "$0" if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert "Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert &lsquo;None')."] <br />(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. <br />(3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. <br />(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): <br />(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; <br />(ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment- <br />(A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); <br />(B) The Contractor's timekeeping procedures; <br />(C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and <br />(D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices. <br />(iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost- <br />(A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and <br />(B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. <br />(5) Overpayments/Underpayments.

The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The contractor's payment will be made by check.

The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in section 611 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-563), which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid.<br />(ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract.<br />(iii) Final Decisions.

The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.<br />(7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions. <br />(i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor. <br />(ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. <br />(iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. <br />(8) Prompt payment.

In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. <br />(l) Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3675.</p>

If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

This test set will include computerized test equipment, tools, adaptors, and any other necessary supplies to fully test and verify the operational condition of electrical system components from a wide variety of USMC tactical and non-tactical ground vehicles and equipment. The electrical system components that require testing include alternators, starters, generators, and regulators. Currently, it is anticipated that the set will take advantage of commercially available testers to simultaneously load test both alternators and starters. The set is anticipated to include separate load testers for alternators and starters. Generator testing is anticipated to take place on the alternator test machine. Regulator testing is anticipated to take place by exchanging the regulator under test for a known good regulator and re-testing the alternator. To meet deployment and transportation requirements, this test set will be fully integrated into a one-side hard-skinned expandable steel shelter meeting ISO 1C standards (8 width x 8 height x 20 length). No canvas or other soft-sided expansions will be allowed. This shelter will also have an integral bale-arm and flatrack that will allow the shelter to be loaded and unloaded using the Load Handling System of the LVSR. The shelter will be certified safe to ship by the Coast Guard or an authorized approval entity. Additionally, the shelter will have integrated spreader bars and forklift pockets in order to take full advantage of all material handling equipment in use by the USMC. It is an objective for the gross mass of the set to be below 15,000 pounds. The test set will include input connections for Mobile Electric Power (MEP) units and Environmental Control Units (ECU) found in the USMC inventory. All other systems/connections required for the operation of the test equipment (e.g. pneumatic, water/cooling, venting, etc.) will be included as part of the set and self-contained. The test set will also include work benches, cabinets with drawers, and shelving for the storage of tools, adaptors, etc. during transport with securing provisions. Where applicable, drawers will include foam with color contrasting cutouts for the inventory control of stored items, including the tool load and test adaptors.<BR><BR>All components of the test set will be supplied by the contractor. All components will be new and unused. It is also required that a full Pro/Engineer native 3D model of the test set and a commercial Technical Manual with a provisioning parts list be delivered to the government. In addition to the expeditionary test set, the government desires the ability to purchase the test set without the shelter, for installation into a garrison facility. Solicitation is for a 5-year requirements type contract. Full and open compe tition.<BR><BR>ESTIMATED ISSUE DATE OF SOLICITATION IS 18 MAY 2010. This solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.501 and 5.102, therefore hardcopies will not be provided. Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet: https://aais.ria.army.mil/AAIS/Solinfo/index.htm. <BR><BR>CAUTION: This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto.

That synopsis stated that the TDP (Technical Data Package) is suitable for full & open competition, which is true; however, there will NOT be full & open competition due to legal restrictions on who will be allowed to be considered for award. Those legal restrictions stem from the Government's need to preserve our country's Small Arms Production Industrial Base. Another modification to this synopsis will be posted when we learn who will be allowed to win a contract according to the Small Arms Program.

<DESC>The Forest Service is requesting proposals for replacement and upgrade on Republic Ranger District Office, building # 2019, remove and replace existing composition roofing 
(approx. 10,591 SF) and sheathing.  The building is 5 years old and exhibiting moisture related failures of the roof system.  Excessive moisture intrusion combined with insufficient attic ventilation appears to be the cause of the roof system issues.   The current roof system has wings with gable ends and the main part of the building is vaulted roof system.  Work includes furring up the roof, re-sheathing with plywood, enhancing ventilation; re-flashing roof, installing baffled ridge vents, replacing fascia, reroofing with standing seam metal roof and humidistat controlled fans in gable end walls. There also will be a bid alternate for reroofing with composition roofing. Contract performance time is 60 days.  Work will need to be done in phases so building is not exposed to the elements.  The job site is located on the Republic Ranger District compound in Republic, Washington, Ferry County.  Solicitations will be available on or about May 25, 2010.  Engineering point of contact is Lou Janke, Facilities Engineer, Colville National Forest, telephone:  (509) 684-7230.  A site visit is tentatively set for June 8, 2010 at 10 am meeting at the Republic Ranger District Office.   Estimated project value $25,000 to $100,000 NAICS 238160 with size $14.0 mil.

These are front end emptying bins."

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) intends to issue a Firm Fixed Price contract on a full and open competition basis.  The acquisition is a custom high speed servohydraulic test system, test system accessories, installation, and training.  The new servohydraulic system must be located in a building that is capable of testing energetic materials, has the necessary electrical power and water line access to operate the pump, and allow the necessary users convenient access to permit work to be performed without delays in testing. The only location that meets the above requirements already houses an MTS servohydraulic test system.  Because of the size of the test system and pump it is necessary to share the pump to be able to house both test systems in the room together. The new test system shall not affect the operation of the MTS test system already in place. Anticipated award is September 2010 or earlier and required delivery will be 2 months after award.  All responsible sources may submit a written proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  The solicitation will be issued on or about June 24, 2010 and will be available through the Federal Business Opportunity website at htttp://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>**** Amendment 12*****<br />The purpose of this amendment is to update vendors on the status of the testing program. TSA has revised the CRT-QMP which will include changes to the schedule.
<p>Below is a list of major changes to the program:<br />1) There will be an additional opening for CRT-QDP submittal. Vendors who have already received a favorable assessment of a CRT-QDP package do not need to resubmit a package for the current configuration. <br />2) There will be three testing windows available for vendors to pass certification within this testing cycle.<br />3) Vendors who have received a favorable assessment of the CRT-QDP will be permitted to participate in Full Threat Weight (FTW) data collection. <br />4) TSA has added additional time in the schedule to allow vendors to use the FTW data for further algorithm development.<br />5) The Schedule of the CRT-QMP (located Appendix A) is a dynamic document; this document will be updated as needed. An updated schedule will be provided to registered vendors as needed.<br />a. Below is a summary of Revised major milestones:</p>
<p>Significant Milestones (Tentative; subject to change)<br />Completion of Window 1 Cert Testing December 21, 2010<br />Opening of Second Window Testing November 3, 2011<br />Completion of Window 2 Cert Testing February 3, 2011<br />Estimated Completion of Window 1 QPL April 29, 2011<br />Estimated completion of Window 2 QPL July 8, 2011<br />Submittal of Window 3 QDP October 1, 2010</p>
<p><br />Vendors who have received a favorable CRT-QDP assessment will receive the updated CRT-QMP schedule automatically.</p>
<p>All other interested parties will have to follow the process noted in Amendment 10 in order to receive any documentation related to this announcement. Vendors submitting a CRT-QDP for the second submission opportunity must submit the information requested in Amendment 10. It is estimated that the vetting process will take up to 10 business days. TSA will not grant vendors additional time for CRT-QDP submission to allow for vetting of a vendor.</p>
<p>Once a vendor is vetted, TSA will provide vendors with the opportunity to enter into CRT data collection. Vendors systems must be in place and ready to begin data collection no later than August 30, 2010 to participate. This data will be used by TSA to evaluate the CRT-QDP. TSA intends to use CRT data for equipment under various categories,</p>
<p>1) CRT data for TSA certified equipment without any configuration changes. Equipment under this category does not require re-testing for CRT and TSA will use existing CRT data to evaluate QDP for CBIS.</p>
<p>2) CRT data for TSA certified equipment with configuration changes. Data previously collected under this equipment category will not be utilized for QDP evaluation due to configuration changes after the initial certification. Equipment under this category is required to undergo the CRT process again in order to collect new CRT data for purposes of evaluating the QDP for CBIS.</p>
<p>3) CRT data for new systems never certified by TSA. Equipment under this category is required to undergo the CRT process just like certified equipment with configuration changes.</p>
<p>Vendors in category 2 &amp; 3 will be fully responsible for shipping, installation, and decommissioning of equipment proposed to be included in data collection. Note that TSA or vendor owned equipment currently located at the TSL may be eligible for use for CRT data collection purposes; however, Offerors that wish to use TSA-owned equipment will be solely responsible for configuration changes expenses before and after testing.</p>
<p>After data collection for equipment under 2 and 3 above is complete, TSA will share all system specific data simultaneously with the respective original equipment manufacturers. This includes data for equipment that falls under any of the equipment categories listed above. <br />NOTE: Vendors planning to participate in the upcoming CBIS procurement will need this data in order to properly prepare a complete QDP package.<br />Any questions regarding this announcement should be submitted to HSTS04ebsp@dhs.gov and provide Amendment 12: Company Name in the Subject Line.</p>
<p>This information is being shared with vendors for planning purposes only. Therefore, TSA is not responsible for any expenses incurred as a result of this RFI. The RFI does not represent an official acquisition plan nor does it commit the Government to any course of action in the future.</p>

The acquisition and resulting multiple award contracts will be collectively referred to as TABSS (Technical, Acquisition and Business Support Services). The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is conducting this department-wide acquisition with on behalf of DHS and all of its components. Use of this contract vehicle will be limited to all DHS components. <br />
<p>The technical, acquisition and business support services to be acquired can be categorized into three domains: (1) Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services, (2) Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services and (3) Contract Management Support Services. These domains comprise the professional services necessary to support a wide-range of Departmental requirements, to include DHS component organizations as well as those more specific in meeting the programmatic needs of the United States Coast Guard Acquisition Directorate (CG-9).</p>
<p>The objectives for this acquisition include:<br />a) Providing a comprehensive range of support services for use throughout the DHS.<br />b) Providing a continuous alignment between business strategy, business processes, and various management support services while simultaneously maintaining an acquisition approach based on flexibility and efficiency.<br />c) Leveraging the DHS spend in acquiring essential support services in an effective, economical, and expedient manner consistent with the DHS mission through the use of this enterprise-wide contract.<br />d) Promote and support DHS socio-economic goals and initiatives.</p>
<p>This acquisition is intended to replace numerous disparate contracts at USCG, as well as 3 multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) awarded by the DHS Strategic Sourcing Program Office. Said multiple-award BPAs consist of those for Acquisition Support Services, Financial Management Support Services and Program Management Support Services, which are scheduled to expire between May and June 2011. TABSS will also serve in companion to the Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (PACTS) contract. Although PACTS may appear to provide similar services as the TABSS Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services domain, the PACTS services are more generalized in nature. Under the TABSS vehicle, program management services are intended to meet a full range of specialized Program, Business, and Acquisition support services across multiple domains ensuring business continuity and integration. In the case of requirements overlap for a specific task order, PACTS will remain DHS' preferred vehicle.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize both unrestricted and small business set-aside award tracks. DHS intends to award a sufficient number of contracts to maintain effective competition in each of the domain tracks. There will be multiple unrestricted and Small Business award tracks, as shown below. The number of awardees per track will be determined later, and may not be uniform among tracks.<br />1. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />2. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />3. Program Management, Engineering and Technology Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track<br />4. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Unrestricted Track<br />5. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; Small Business Track<br />6. Business, Financial Management and Audit Support Services Domain; preferred SDV Track<br />7. Contract Management Support Services Domain; preferred 8(a) Track</p>
<p>The resulting IDIQ contract will have an ordering period of five (5) years from award.</p>
<p>A draft solicitation for this acquisition is currently planned to be released in May 2010. Interested parties will have 1-2 weeks to submit questions and comments related to this draft. These questions and comments will be addressed at an Industry Day/Pre-solicitation Conference in late May or early June 2010. DHS anticipates release of a final solicitation shortly following this event. Contractors will be provided sufficient time after solicitation relaserelease to develop and submit proposals.</p>
<p>An email address has been established for this acquisition - TABSS@USCG.MIL. Due to the large number of parties interested in this acquisition, use of email communication (sent to this address) is strongly encouraged to ensure timely response to questions.</p>
<p>This synopsis corresponds to Advance Acquisition Plan (AAP) 62889, which is posted on the DHS AAP website (https://www.fido.gov/dhs/aap/publicview.asp).</p>

This project consists of approximately 3.3 acres of unimproved land in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  VAâs objective for this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to receive proposals from Offerors/Lessees offering to redevelop the available approximately 3.3 acres at the EUL Site under a long-term ground lease agreement with VA for up to seventy-five (75) years.  In return for a long-term lease of the property, the Offeror will provide âfair considerationâ to VA.  VAâs primary objective in leasing the property is for a selected developer to establish and, thereby, increase the number of permanent/transitional housing units with on-site supportive services available to homeless Veterans, including those at imminent risk of homelessness, and eligible non-Veterans. 

Additional information regarding this opportunity, including the RFP will be available on the project website:  http://www4.va.gov/ASSETMANAGEMENT/MissionHomeless/Martinsburg/index.asp

 VA-262-10-RQ-0317
Reagents and Consumables for the Magna Pure System
VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System
VA Long Beach Healthcare System

This solicitation was issued as a sole source in accordance with FAR Part 6.302     

BASIS FOR AWARD: Award of this solicitation shall be based on the offeror's ability to provide those specific products listed in the Section entitled Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs, offeror's past performance and prices. 

A pre-solicitation notice was posted on May 20, 2010 stating the Government's intent to negotiate a commercial item (FAR Part 12) sole source contract with Roche Diagnostics, 9115 Hague RD, Indianapolis IN 46250-0457, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This solicitation incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular.  A justification for other than full and open competition was been prepared in support of this acquisition. The resulting contract will be a firm-fixed price contract for a base year, with the Government's option to exercise four (4), one (1) year option periods.  

No inquiries or responses to the pre-solicitation were received.  The solicitation was issued on May 27, 2010, with offers due on June 4, 2010. Roche Diagnostics is the only company able to satisfy the government's requirements of the solicitation.

Past Performance: Roche Diagnostics received laudatory comments from the previous COTR based on their past 5-year performance of the expiring contract. 

Price Evaluation:  Pricing submitted by Roche Diagnostics determined to be fair and reasonable. This is based on comparison of the proposed contract pricing to the following:

a. The previous contract pricing.  The proposed contract pricing is inline, following the same pricing pattern as in the previous contract pricing.  The previous contract was determined to be fair and reasonable based on a price negotiation/cost breakdown memorandum prepared by the contracting officer with input from the contractor. 

Award Determination:  Because of the Proprietary nature of this contract, Roche Diagnostics is the only company capability to satisfactorily perform the contract.  Therefore it is my determination that Roche Diagnostics, meeting the criteria established in the Solicitation, be awarded the contract for the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System and VA Long Beach Healthcare System.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because a statute exists that expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specific source or through another agency (FAR 6.302-5); specifically, Sole source awards under the 8(a) Program. Per FAR 6.302-5 a J&A is not required for this award.<br><br>The May 18 eruption of Mount Saint Helens in Washington in 1980 resulted in approximately 3.8 billion cubic yards of earth materials being released in a massive landslide. The resulting debris avalanche deposit has continued to erode and introduce sediment materials into the Toutle-Cowlitz-Columbia River system. This contract is for the construction of a pilot project consisting of Grade Building Structures in order to help alleviate the sediment problem that is occurring downstream. Grade Building Structures (GBS) in general are structures to be built in the sediment plain above the existing Sediment Retention Structure (SRS) for the purpose of increasing sediment deposition in the plain and decreasing the volume of sediment available for deposition in the Cowlitz River. The concept of Grade Building Structures was proposed as one of several potential measures for managing the sediment eroding from the debris avalanche on Mount Saint Helens and being transported through the North Fork Toutle, Main Stem Toutle and Cowlitz River systems. The purpose of the Pilot Project is to test the sediment retention performance of a few types of Grade Building Structures.  The SRS sediment plain is currently an actively aggrading, predominantly unvegetated braided channel network. Channel locations change widely and rapidly during winter storm events but tend to stabilize during the drier summer months. It is theorized that as the valley slopes increase and sediment loads decline, the SRS sediment plain would transition fro  m the current unvegetated braided network to a multi-channel and island network. The sediment plain is showing the beginnings of an ability to grow depositional islands and vegetate them near the SRS, however these islands are fragile and may quickly be eroded. This expected multi-thread channel system is also called an anastomosing river pattern.  The anastomosing landform reengages the channel and the island overbank during high sediment laden flows, depositing material in a stabilized island environment where it is retained for a longer period. This is in contrast to the unvegetated braided system where the moving channel may mix the substrate stripping out the finer materials and move them downstream.  In order for the river to become more stable in this pattern, island growth will need to be induced and potentially sustained with planted vegetation. This may be more quickly attained by the implementation of a system of structures that could help speed the timeline<BR>  for the creation of this process. The goal of the overall Grade Building Structures is to help speed the forming of this anastomosing river pattern which would increase sediment capacity as the islands fill, sustain vegetation, become inundated, and fill again in a pattern the river naturally moves into. The objective is to allow the river to move towards this natural pattern in order to attain the goal of quickened sediment capacity, while maintaining fish passage, debris passage, and sustainable construction efforts.

<DESC>The objective of the work is to measure the loads induced in the lifting mechanism for the upper service gate at Lockport Lock, Joliet Illinois.  All testing will be performed in the controlled environment of the building, which houses the machinery to minimize temperature effects in the strain gage responses. Compensation for bending effects will be achieved electronically through a Wheatstone bridge by appropriately mounting the two strain gages on each of the members tested. The two strain gages are necessary to monitor axial strain and compensate for bending effects. The gage configuration will allow all fourteen (14) anchor end rods of the lift cables to function as load cells in the case that any load distribution adjustments on the cables are necessary. Period of Performance within 5 days of award<BR>
