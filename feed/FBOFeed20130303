<DESC><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong><br /><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THIS IS A FOLLOW-ON</strong>.  This is a Pre-Solicitation / Notice of Intent synopsis.  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Emory University, 2165 North Decatur Road, Decatur, Georgia 30033 to provide genetic testing for Undiagnosed Diseases Program for rare and new genetic disorders, specifically, cutting edge analysis of blood, urine and fibroblasts for congenital glycosylation (CDG) and lysosomal storage disorders.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></span>:</p>
<p>This is a follow-on requirement.   The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP) is a pilot program designed to address the needs of persons with debilitating medical conditions for which no diagnosis has been found despite an extensive workup. The goals of the UDP include finding accurate diagnoses and discovering new diseases that provide insight into human physiology and genetics. The UDP was established to evaluate participants who have undiagnosed medical conditions. UDP participants have generally received extensive diagnostic workups before traveling to NIH and often have numerous and/or complex medical problems. The UDP program makes use of a diverse set of diagnostic and research techniques both to attempt to find a diagnosis and to generate research projects to advance medical knowledge.</p>
<p>The DIR-NHGRI-Undiagnosed Diseases program (UDP) protocol 76-HG-0238, Clinical Trial Number: NCT00369421 is connected to this clinical testing, which began in 2008 as a vehicle for admitting patients with broader range of inborn errors of metabolism.  Under this observational protocol study, patients with long-standing, complex undiagnosed diseases are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for comprehensive evaluation to discover new genetic disorders and/or potential treatments. The UDP program has made 47 diagnoses, which is about 20% of the total number of patients seen in this protocol to date.  The Researchers in the Protocol study intend on diagnosing and treating certain inborn errors of metabolism. By doing this, researchers hope to expand their knowledge about these disorders and provide access to patients of interest for research, teaching, and clinical experience.  Patients enrolled in this protocol have been referred with a known or suspected inborn error of metabolism, heritable disorder, or genetic predisposition.  Patients participating in this study will be examined and treated on an outpatient basis, if practical. However, patients requiring specialized tests or treatments will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center as necessary.  Researchers will use only accepted medical procedures in diagnosing (medical history, physical examinations, X-ray studies, eye examinations, blood tests, and urine tests) and treating the patients involved in this study.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</strong></span>:</p>

THOSE ENTITIES WHO HAVE ALREADY REGISTERED WILL BE NOTIFIED OF THIS CHANGE BY EMAIL. **<br /><br /><br />The U.S. Department of State (DOS) has a requirement for a qualified Contractor to provide Local Guard Services for U.S. Mission Germany. The U.S. Mission Germany requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in the Performance Work Statement. The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets; to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks.

<p>All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability for employment under this contract.</p>
<p>Due to the large dollar value and complexity of the U.S. Mission Germany Local Guard Program, the Department of State has determined the need to conduct a pre-solicitation conference before releasing the solicitation for this requirement. This conference will be used to highlight key areas of the solicitation, discuss issues that may affect prospective offerors ability to manage this contract, and show prospective slides of the place of performance (i.e., specific guard posts) of locations covered by this requirement in lieu of an actual "site visit" to each respective location. ATTENDANCE AT THIS PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE IS MANDATORY for any offeror who wants to submit a proposal for this requirement. This conference will be held at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, Germany at <strong>1:00 PM</strong> local on November 15, 2012.</p>
<p>Offerors interested in attending must preregister by contacting Amanda Rogers, rogersan@state.gov no later than 4:00 pm EDT, November 13, 2012. No more than three (3) representatives from each interested offeroring firm (to include potential joint venture partners) may attend the pre-proposal conference. Interested offerors shall provide the name (s) of the representative (s) who will attend the conference, name of the representing firm, address of the firm, telephone number of each person attending and DUNS number of the firm that will be the primary contractor. Each attendee of the conference SHALL PRESENT TWO FORMS OF PICTURE IDENTIFICATION confirming identity. Those representatives unable to present two forms of identification SHALL BE TURNED AWAY at the door. Preregistration is MANDATORY. Interested offerors are solely responsible for ALL expenses resulting from this announcement (i.e. travel, lodging, per diem, proposal costs and other miscellaneous expenses, etc.) and are responsible for confirming all dates specified in this announcement by immediately checking the solicitation when posted on www.FEDBIZOPPS.gov to see if there are any changes.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates posting the U.S. Mission Germany solicitation on this site <strong>at least</strong>&nbsp;<strong>sixty (60)&nbsp;</strong>days after the pre-solicitation conference. No paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately&nbsp;<strong>forty-five (45)</strong> days to submit proposals. All dates are subject to change and any change will be posted on this site.</p>
<p>Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Amanda N. Rogers at rogersan@state.gov PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>In accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons. The contract will be awarded to the best technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.</p>
