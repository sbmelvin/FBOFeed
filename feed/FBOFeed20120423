<DESC>This Draft RFP is issued by HQ AFSOC/A7KQ to solicit responses, questions, suggestions from qualified offerors prior to the official solicitation.  Prospective offerors are invited to submit written comments, suggestions or questions via email to Diana R. Graziano at diana.graziano@hurlburt.af.mil no later than 2:00 p.m. CST on or before 2 December 2011.  When responding reference Draft RFP FA0021-12-R-0001 CV-22 CMS.  All answers to questions submitted will be posted to FedBizOpps.  Suggestions and comments may or may not be posted, however will be considered before posting the official RFP.

This Draft Solicitation provides for a non-personal services contract to augment the Government by providing CV-22 aircraft maintenance support.  It is anticipated to be a Competitive 8(a) acquisition approved by SBA with Requirement Number 0491/12/200137.  This acquisition is planned to consist of a base period of 12-months and 4 option periods.  Additionally, it is anticipated there will be a few Optional CLINs that may or may not be executed pending Government need, approvals and/or funding.  These options are detailed in the solicitation.  This requirement is for CV-22 Contractor Maintenance Support Augmentation.  It is planned to be a Fixed Price contract with reimbursable CLINs.  Due to the nature of this service, augmenting military units, the contractor does not have ownership of any of the maintenance functions.  Therefore, this requirement is not considered performance based.  The Government is providing details, number of CMEs, and locations for these services (see Attachment 1, Level of Support / Growth); however, the offeror is still required to meet all Statement of Work (SOW) requirements to include deliverables and Service Delivery Summary thresholds.  The periods of performance are as follows:  

Base Period:  1 April 2011  31 March 2012
Option Period 1:  1 April 2012  31 March 2013
Option Period 2:  1 April 2013  31 March 2014
Option Period 3:  1 April 2014  31 March 2015
Option Period 4:  1 April 2015  31 March 2016 


This requirement provides for non-personal Contractor Maintenance Support (CMS) services to Hurlburt Field, Florida; Kirtland AFB, New Mexico; Cannon AFB, New Mexico; and RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom with an estimated start of 1 April 2013.  The plan for the Optional Mildenhall start up is to man 66% in option period one and 100% for the remaining periods (see Attachment 1, Level of Support/Growth).  There is potential for a future base in the PACOM with a start date to be determined later.  The CV-22 aircraft have the primary missions of combat and training missions driving both CONUS and O-CONUS support requirements.  The CV-22 is a weapons system that currently has limited organic maintenance capability.  Because of that limited capability and the complexity of the aircraft, the maintenance concept is a combined effort of Air Force and Contractor Maintenance Support (CMS) technicians.  Both Air Force and CMS technicians are responsible for Organizational level (O-level) and Intermediate level (I-level) maintenance.  The CV-22 aircraft located at Hurlburt Field, FL; Cannon AFB, NM; and RAF Mildenhall, UK, and potential for a future base in the PACOM AOR are operational assets that will be deployed overseas to conduct and support AFSOC operations.  CMS personnel assigned at those locations will be required to deploy or perform temporary duty world-wide in support of CV-22 mission requirements.  Contractor personnel at Kirtland AFB, NM will be required to support CONUS TDY operations.

The CMS service provider shall provide V-22 experienced maintenance production supervision and personnel to execute all Organizational and applicable Intermediate (O and I)-level maintenance operations.  The requirement is a mix of Mechanical Specialty Maintainers and Electrical/Avionics Specialty Maintainers as outlined in the solicitation Attachment 1.   The CV-22 program will continue to mature from a current 20 aircraft to an end-state of 50 aircraft through 2016.  Final aircraft basing is not yet determined.  The increase in aircraft may drive a requirement for additional growth in CMS personnel to conduct aircraft maintenance and on-the-job training at each location.  The specific personnel requirements are outlined in the attached Draft Solicitation Statement of Work found in Section C; Descriptions and Specifications.

<p>Description</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award sole source contracts to State Agencies for Egg Inspections. The State Agencies must have the authority and capability necessary to gain access to private commercial establishments in order to conduct regulatory inspections in accordance with the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. On July 9, 2009, FDA published a final rule requiring shell egg producers to implement certain measures to prevent salmonella enteritidis (SE) from contaminating eggs on the farm from further growth during storage and transportation. The final rule, which is codified in 21 CFR 118, will be implemented in a staggered fashion with larger producers (greater than 50,000 layers) required to be in compliance by July 9, 2010 and smaller producers (3,000-49,999 layers) being in compliance by July 9, 2012. It is anticipated that awards will be made for a 12 month contract period to the larger producers this fiscal year only. The solicitation will be available on or about May 7, 2012 on the FedBizOpps website at http://fedbizopps.gov. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and amendments. Hard copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act upon request. The proposed contract actions are for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only once source as authorized by statute under the authority of FAR 6.302-5. This notice is issued for informational purposes and is not a request for competitive proposals. Any interested party should submit a statement of capabilities in sufficient detail to determine if the requirements of this synopsis can be met no later than 15 days from the date of this announcement. A determination by Government not to compete the proposed contracts based on responses from this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses to this notice must be sent via email to Allison.Mlawsky@fda.hhs.gov. No phone calls will be accepted.</p>

<DESC>AG-0356-S-12-0013&nbsp; Slag-a-Melt Trail<br />The project includes the construction and reconditioning of three travel routes: 1-Slag-a-Melt Trail No. 3186, 2-Slag-a-Melt Road No. 3967 and 3-Moose Creek Trail/Road No. 7363. Moose Creek is a recently closed road that is open to non-motorized traffic only. Trail Logs only exist for Slag-a-Melt Trail No. 3186 the other two routes are only staked. Construction items include clearing and grubbing, turns, drainage structures, fence construction, sign and bulletin board installation, and road maintenance work. Stake refreshing and cleanup are required in this contract. The project is located in rocky soil. The main objective of this project is to create a safe riding environment, and reduce erosion into nearby Slag-a-Melt Creek.
<p>Project Location and Directions -&nbsp;Slag-a-Melt Trail 3186 is located in the West Big Hole approximately 13 air miles west of the town of Jackson, Montana. The trail begins in Section 26 of T. 5 S., R 17 W. Three miles from the trailhead are the Slag-a-Melt Lakes, a popular destination for ATVs, hikers, and stock. Access to the Continental Divide Trail is 2.5 miles from the trailhead. A portion of this trail is on a shared route with the Continental Divide Trail. The access road to the trailhead, Slag-a-Melt Road, is 1.9 miles long, and will receive minor road maintenance in the form of drivable rolling dips.</p>
<p>To get to Slag-a-Melt Trailhead take the Twin Lakes turnoff of Hwy 278 just South of Wisdom around mile marker 53. Drive on the Twin Lakes Road 945 for 17 miles. There are two instances when you have to veer left one at mile 4.2, and one at 8.3, but remain on Road 945. After 17 miles on 945 turn right onto Road 625, Big Swamp Creek Road. After 2.3 miles turn right onto 3944. (There's a sign that says Slag-a-melt 1.., it's really 3.2) After 1.3 miles turn left onto 3967 (the only part of the drive you need a high clearance vehicle, if you have an ATV I'd unload here). After 1.9 miles you're at the trailhead.</p>
<p>Moose Creek Trail 3376 is located north of Slag-a-Melt approximately 8 air miles. The trail begins in Section 16 of T 4 S., R. 17 W. The work on Moose Creek Trail shall be from the new closure up to the beginning of the existing trail. The work will consist of constructing drain dips. Drain dip locations shall be staked prior to construction.</p>
<p>To get to the Moose Creek Trail travel approximately 4 miles west of Wisdom and turn south onto Swamp Creek Road. Travel about 10 miles to a junction on BLM stay left and continue onto the forest on Road No. 624. Approximately 4 miles west is a junction with Forest Road No. 3944 turn right (south) onto 3944 and continue past a series of junctions about 5 miles to Forest Road No. 7364 towards Schultz Reservoir. Spur off 7364 at a junction about one mile from 3944 onto Forest Road No. 7363. The work on Moose Creek begins at the new closure.</p>
<p>Performance period is 90 calendar days with an estimated July 1, 2012 start date. <br />&nbsp;No formal site visit is planned. Please contact Kendra Bull, 406.683.3962 for more information.</p>
<p>Construction Magnitude is between $25,000 and $100,000&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service's Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) has a requirement for various projects including trawl surveys predominately in Eastern Gulf of Alaska and within inside waters of SE Alaska. AFSC conducts scientific research on fish stocks, fish habitats, and the chemistry of marine environments. Information from this research is widely used by commercial interests such as fishing industries, and governmental agencies involved in managing natural resources. This research relies upon marine survey data on commercially marketable species such as rockfish, sablefish, and salmon, and on non-marketable and/or protected species such as eel grass, plankton, Steller sea lions, and harbor seals which is then turned into information products essential to fishing industries, state and federal regulators, and international treaty bodies. This vessel charter is essential to support ecosystem-based approaches to management and is critical to the AFSC mission.
<p>The objective of this vessel charter is to provide continuity to important missions of NOAA Fisheries, Alaska Fisheries Science Center. The principal mission requirements along with key research themes are listed below:</p>
<p>1. Surface/midwater trawling: research on young of the year sablefish, rockfish, and salmonid recruitment and its association with climate and biophysical parameters; seasonal assessments of forage fish life-history, abundance, and predator-prey relationships. <br />2. Oceanography: collection of biophysical data for recruitment studies and for development of ecosystem indicators; research on survival and early life history (egg and larvae) of rockfish and sablefish.<br />3. Marine mammal observations: support for marine mammal surveys which includes small boat operations, acoustic work, and animal tracking.</p>
<p>Period of performance for the base period shall be approximately for 81 days, 6/23/12 - 9/12/12 (Base Period), 33 days, 9/13/12 -- 10/16/12 (Option Period 1), 81 days, 6/23/13 - 9/12/13 (Option Period 2), 33 days, 9/13/13 - 10/16/13 (Option Period 3).</p>
<p><br />The Contractor shall furnish the vessel, necessary personnel, material, equipment, services and facilities (except as otherwise specified) to perform as following:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide a vessel with a minimum overall length (LOA) of 36.5m (120 ft) and the vessel shall have been actively used for commercial trawling or research where trawl gear was used in the past 12 months. The vessel must have berthing accommodations for between four (4) and six (6) scientists. In additional, the vessel must have a minimum continuous horsepower output from main engine (s) of 1000 HP and be capable of the following:</p>

<DESC><div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INFORMATIONAL NOTICE ONLY - NO RESPONSE IS SOLICITED AT THIS TIME</span></strong></div>
<div><strong><br />BACKGROUND<br />&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>The U.S. Department of State (DoS) leads the United States in its relationships with foreign governments, international organizations, and people of other countries. The administration has elevated diplomacy and development alongside defense as the three core pillars of US foreign policy. The DoS seeks to build a new global architecture of cooperation. The DoS seeks to use all the tools at its disposal to practice 21st century statecraft, relying on partnerships, cross-cutting solutions, and harnessing the power of technology and the talents of our people - this smart power is the driving force behind our progress.</div>
<div><br />The Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM) provides the information technology (IT) and services the DoS needs to successfully carry out its foreign policy mission. Currently, IRM provides enterprise architecture design, engineering, operations and maintenance support services for desktops, servers, networks, firewalls, and enterprise applications across the DoS. IRM is also responsible for planning and implementing the next generation strategies for IT management for diplomacy and securing information services and data, anytime and anywhere Diplomacy calls for IT. In order to meet a minimum level of service and protection of information, the DoS seeks to improve the skill levels of its IT professionals, its process and program implementations, its IT facilities server rooms, its spending, its service gaps, and its standards of performance.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>In recent years, major improvements have been made to the DoS' IT global network including bandwidth management, tools engineering, centralized patch management, enterprise security improvements, mobile computing, standardized hardware refresh and knowledge management. These improvements have resulted in reduction in bandwidth cost per bit, improved network availability, reliability, and availability, and security. Currently the DoS is concentrating on hardening the DoS infrastructure and improving defensive sensors, strengthening the availability of efficient, cost effective and secure IT infrastructure and systems worldwide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year by consolidating common utility services and reengineering the network. Additionally, these activities will enhance the DoS' ability to move toward cloud computing in the next few years.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>The DoS' IT enterprise strategy is named "Vanguard" and is divided into eight (8) main areas of focus:<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>-- Focus Area 1 ("Vanguard 2.2.1") consists of the DoS' servers, mainframes, network devices, network perimeter, Anti-Virus Engineering, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)/Biometrics/Encryption, Monitoring Tools, Telephony, Mobile Computing Platform, Virtual Environment, and Enclave Design/Security Engineering. Vanguard 2.2.1 was awarded to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) on December 22, 2010.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>-- Focus Area 2 ("Vanguard 2.2.2") consists of the DoS' IT Change Control Board (CCB) Support, Enterprise Licensing, Anti-Virus Operations/Purchasing, Video Teleconferencing Center (VTC), and hardware technical security testing/forensics. Vanguard 2.2.2 was awarded to Advanced Alliant Solutions Team (AAST) on March 28, 2012.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>-- Focus Areas 3 and 4 ("Vanguard 2.3") will consist of the DoS' web administration, database administration, and software development for selected enterprise applications (e.g., State Messaging Archive Retrieval Toolset (SMART), Post Administrative Software Suite (WebPASS) and Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW)); Remedy; SharePoint; and other Toolsets. All Enterprise Server Room Operations (ESOC) will be included in this focus group.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>-- Focus Area 5 ("Vanguard 2.1") will consist of helpdesk and desktop support services. Vanguard 2.1 is in Source Selection at the date of this notice and an award decision is expected in the second quarter of Calendar Year 2012.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>-- Focus Area 6 will consist of the enterprise architecture and other program management activities.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>-- Focus Area 7 ("Vanguard 2.2.4") consists of cabling and conduit operations. Vanguard 2.2.4 was awarded to Copper River Information Technology on September 12, 2011.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>-- Focus Area 8 ("Vanguard 2.2.3") will consist of supply chain management operations. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>The overall Vanguard strategy will use a small number of large and small businesses tied together by associate contractor agreements to improve or enhance performance and concentrate on hardening the DoS IT infrastructure. Vanguard will implement the necessary quality control mechanisms needed to integrate the multiple assemblages of technology found throughout the DoS. Through the consolidated Vanguard strategy, DoS expects to move forward with secure and efficient worldwide IT enterprise services both now and well into the future. This notice will focus on the Area 3 and 4 acquisitions for Web Administration and Software Development and Enterprise Server Room Operations Services to be known as VANGUARD 2.3.</div>
<div><strong><br />SCOPE OF SERVICES<br />&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>As DoS continues to execute its IT Consolidation Program, it is currently planning for "Vanguard 2.3" pre-solicitation activities leading to the solicitation and award of a performance-based contract or task order (or multiple performance-based contracts or task orders) to provide web administration, database administration, and software development for selected enterprise applications (e.g., State Messaging Archive Retrieval Toolset (SMART), Post Administrative Software Suite (WebPASS) and Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW)), Remedy, SharePoint, Toolsets, and all Enterprise Server Room Operations (ESOC) for the DoS' critical enterprise-wide IT network infrastructure.<br />&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Government recognizes that the consolidation of this scope under one or a few contract(s) will be a gradual process as different tasks and components transition from many contracts and/or task orders to the effort that will be covered by this acquisition.</div>
<div><strong><br />PURPOSE<br />&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>The Government intends to issue a Sources Sought ("Request for Information") notice for Vanguard 2.3 within the next few months. The Sources Sought notice will be issued on FedBizOpps as an amendment to this notice (SAQMMA12I0010). The acquisition/procurement strategy for Vanguard 2.3 - including but not limited to the competitive approach; solicitation, evaluation, and award methodology; contract vehicle (if applicable); socio-economic considerations; scope or services; period of performance; rough order of magnitude/budget; intended number of awards; and acquisition timeline - has not yet been determined. Due to the high volume of inquiries regarding Vanguard 2.3 sent by industry to the DoS over recent months, the DoS is posting this notice as a means of public communication, and to provide an automated tracking mechanism for interested parties.</div>
<div><strong><br />INSTRUCTIONS TO INTERESTED PARTIES<br />&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>Please note that there is no additional information regarding Vanguard 2.3 available to the public at this time, and this notice does not solicit a response. The DoS looks forward to working closely with industry as it proceeds with the Vanguard 2.3 acquisition. However, the Government requests that interested parties DO NOT contact the DoS regarding Vanguard 2.3 at this time, since no additional information is finalized and ready for publication. Accordingly, unsolicited inquiries regarding Vanguard 2.3 sent to the DoS may be disregarded. Procurement integrity regulations prohibit the release of acquisition sensitive information in any manner that might give one potential offeror a competitive advantage over any other potential offeror. The DoS is working diligently to finalize its strategy for this acquisition, and will post pre-solicitation activity notice(s) under this FedBizOpps posting header as they become available. Interested parties are encouraged to begin monitoring this acquisition on www.fedbizopps.gov and to begin engaging in high level discussions within their respective internal organizations and among their industry partners.</div>
<div><br /><em>Information in this notice is subject to change and may be superseded by subsequent notices and/or other official Government documents.</em></div>

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Network Contracting Office (NCO) 5, will solicit proposals under Solicitation No. VA245-12-R-0019 for the following:
Rural Case Management Outreach for Homeless Veterans and those at risk of Homelessness
Background Information
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a goal of ending homelessness among Veterans by 2015.  This goal is supported through the placement of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) homelessness services in rural areas, where there is identified community support for this population.  Rural or out-of-state homeless Veterans have difficulty or refuse to lease their state to seek services from VA Medical Center (VAMC) Homeless Programs.  Returning Veterans and Veterans struggling due to the economy may not have the knowledge or resources to prevent homelessness.  A VA homelessness program based in rural communities is needed to outreach, engage, case manage, refer, and educate homeless Veterans and Veterans at-risk of becoming homeless.  Homelessness services are needed in rural areas, where it is difficult for homeless Veterans to travel to medical centers for assessment.  Challenges with rural transportation and assessment time may leave Veterans stranded overnight away from services in their communities.  This overnight absence may also impact current housing in a community shelter or create other social support issues, which in turn may create additional barriers to ending homelessness.
Scope and Task Summary
This 12-month contract proposes to continue the establishment of a homelessness services program for rural communities in Pocomoke City, MD; Cambridge, MD; Charlotte Hall, MD; and Stephens City, VA by providing homelessness  evaluation and coordination with Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in these areas. Four Licensed Masters of Social Work (MSWs) and/or Licensed Mental Health Counselors (LMHCs) will act as contracted case managers, working out of the CBOCs or appropriate location within the rural community to enhance Veteran participation and to conduct immediate consultations.  When Veterans seek assistance or are referred, the case manager and CBOC staff will begin the process of enrollment and coordinate primary care and mental health assessment, as appropriate.  Furthermore, the case manager will work with the Veterans to coordinate appropriate VA services and referrals.
In addition to providing case management and identification and referral to needed resources, the case managers will also foster partnerships and collaboration among local health and mental health agencies and resources, establish standard operating procedures for working with the target population, develop service agreements with community resources, and advertise Veteran homelessness prevention services.
Additional Information
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this procurement are 621330, Offices of Mental Health Practitioners, size standard $7.0 million, and 624310, Vocational Rehabilitation Services, size standard $7.0 million.  
This acquisition is 100% set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). All offerors must be registered and certified at VETBIZ.gov.  http://www.vetbiz.gov/ They must also be registered at Central Contractor Registry https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/ and complete online Reps and Certs at https://orca.bpn.gov/.
No telephone requests will be accepted. Any questions regarding the solicitation should be sent via e-mail and addressed to Ms. Sally Familton, Contract Specialist, in writing at Sally.Familton@va.gov.  Electronic solicitations will be available for download from the URL address at https://www.fbo.gov on or about March 14, 2012.

This RFI is for informational planning purposes only and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any actual procurement of materials, machinery, or services. This notice does not constitute a solicitation or a promise of a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI are solely at the responding parties' expense. Respondents are solely responsible for properly marking and clearly identifying any proprietary information or trade secrets contained within their response.

Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future solicitation, if one is issued.</p>
<p>The U. S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), is interested in obtaining information about various IR-variable inks with potential application as machine-readable features on future generations of U. S. currency. An IR-variable ink is defined as an ink wherein its respective absorption/reflection spectrum in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the spectrum contains spectral features - in contrast to one having a relatively flat spectral response - but is not limited to any particular visual color. Proposed IR-variable inks should be novel but may be based on commercially available materials. The inks may have other characteristics not related to its NIR spectral response such as magnetic properties, fluorescence, etc. In fact, any additional effects will be considered a plus for any given ink. An effective IR-variable ink should be:</p>
<p>A. one with an absorption/reflection spectrum in the NIR that is not flat<br />B. useful for printing methods used in security printing, e.g., intaglio, offset, letterpress, screen and others <br />C. readable by a discriminating standalone detection system<br />D. resistant to simulation or duplication, both in terms of material and spectral response</p>
<p>The responses are limited to 10 pages in Microsoft windows compatible software. Responses to contain the following information:</p>
<p>1. the name of the ink and its visual color<br />2. its respective absorption/reflection spectrum ranging from, at minimum, 400 - 1700 nm<br />3. a description of the measurement methodology for #2<br />4. any further information about the characteristics of the ink and other additives which may be used with the ink<br />5. a brief summary of the security of the ink relative to simulation and duplication and why, and<br />6. any number of responses of ink examples may be submitted <br />7. Company name, point of contact, web site, email, and telephone number<br />8. Business size classification<br />9. DUNS number</p>
<p>No actual ink materials or chemicals are requested at this time. The submitted responses will be reviewed for inherent and relative effectiveness as a security feature. Future assessments may include compatibility with design and production factors, durability, environmental acceptability, health and safety and other processing requirements.</p>
<p><br />The Bureau may submit offered technologies to outside technical experts under government contracts for their evaluation subject to the approval of the submitting party. Previously submitted materials or technologies need not be resubmitted.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.<br /><br />The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) intends to issue a procurement for the following research study in 2012 and is seeking statements of capability from potential bidders. <br /><br />FNS is strongly encouraging small businesses with the ability to provide the services outlined in the Objectives statement to present a capability statements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CREATING INCENTIVES FOR HEALTHY CHOICES <br />BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:<br /></strong><br />The diets of most Americans fall short of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGAs) and many consume calories in excess of their daily needs, which over time leads to overweight and obesity. About one third of all children and two-thirds of all adults are overweight or obese. Most Americans, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants have very low intakes of whole grains, dark green and orange vegetables, and legumes, and high intakes of saturated fat and discretionary calories from solid fats, and added sugars. <br /><br />SNAP households spend about a quarter of their income on food. Recent data (Consumer Expenditure Survey, 2010 www.bls.gov) shows minor differences between low-income families and families at the high end of the income distribution when it comes to budget shares across broadly defined food categories even though families with higher incomes spend over twice as much. For example, the percentage of annual food expenditures on fruits and vegetables are quite similar (.20 high-income versus .18 low-income). Food purchasing decisions of all Americans, including SNAP participants could use improvement.<br /><br />The American marketplace provides a wide array of food products making it difficult for consumers to process product information and make healthy choices. The recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) report "Front of Package Nutrition Systems and Symbols: Promoting Healthier Choices" concluded that existing front-of-package (FOP) rating systems have not changed consumer behavior and suggested shifting away from an information based nutrition rating system that informs consumers about nutrition facts to one that clearly communicates and encourages healthy food purchases. <br /><br />This project will develop a plan for incentivizing healthy choices by SNAP participants based on the assumption that there is an existing FOP or labeling system that can be applied across all categories of food. Incentives could be tailored for increasing purchasing power by allowing households to purchase two units of a healthy choice with the same benefit amount needed to purchase one unit of a less healthy choice. Incentive could also be provided in the form of targeted discounts at the point of purchase to encourage healthy choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>OBJECTIVES: <br /></strong><br />The proposed project will develop an approach for promoting healthier food purchases by SNAP participants in a manner that is consistent with Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The objectives of the proposed project are:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. To develop a plan for how FOP or shelf labeling systems could applied to identify healthy choices across all food categories (processed, unprocessed, packaged, bulk etc) and could be used as a basis for incentivizing healthy choices for SNAP participants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. To provide approaches for incentivizing healthy choices by SNAP participants. The feasibility and the mechanism for implementing each approach including the need for any adjunct interventions must be considered along with its potential for promoting long-term behavior change.<br /><br />The key question to consider is that if there was one or more FOP or shelf labeling system that could be applied across all categories of food, how one would go about implementing it in the food retail environment for incentivizing healthy choices by SNAP participants. The desired outcome of this project is a feasible plan for incentivizing healthy choices by SNAP participants.<br /><br />To meet the project objectives, FNS is seeking firms with the capabilities of providing:<br /><br />&bull;&nbsp; Demonstrated knowledge of how the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits are administered.<br />&bull;&nbsp; Staff with demonstrated nutrition recommendations and nutrition guidance expertise.<br />&bull;&nbsp; Knowledge of food retailers operations including determinants of sales and weekly promotions.<br />&bull;&nbsp; The resources to achieve the objectives on schedule, including availability of staff with the technical expertise in food marketing, nutrition labeling, consumer behavior and psychology of incentives, behavioral economics, computer modeling, food and nutrition, and health literacy. <br />&bull;&nbsp; A dedicated project director who can deliver high quality work, adhere to a compressed project schedule; keep costs within budget, manage the work of the professionals completing the task.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The firm must demonstrate that they have the capabilities to achieve the project objectives. <br /><br />Interested parties should submit a statement of capability outlining their institutional capabilities to complete the project. The statement of capabilities should also include:<br /><br />&bull;&nbsp; Contractor Name<br />&bull;&nbsp; Address<br />&bull;&nbsp; Point of Contact (POC)<br />&bull;&nbsp; POC phone number and email address<br />&bull;&nbsp; DUNS number<br />&bull;&nbsp; Business status (i.e., large/small business, disadvantaged, Hub Zone, woman-owned, etc.)<br />&bull;&nbsp; GSA MOBIS schedule (if your firm has a GSA MOBIS schedule)<br /><br />Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses, or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and future RFP. No questions will be entertained or comment responded to by the government.<br /><br />Offers capable of providing these services should submit the information requested via email to Christina Carter-Kurant (christina.carter-kurant@fns.usda.gov) no later than 2:00 PM, Tuesday, May 8, 2012.<br /><br />Please limit the length of packages to 10 pages.

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Background Information<br />The major focus of the Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging Group at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is development and validation of new cardiovascular imaging. Routine noninvasive cardiac imaging techniques, such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cardiovascular computed tomography (CT), are performed on patients to diagnose coronary artery disease.<br />The extent and severity of coronary stenoses can be determined using coronary CT angiography (CTA). The presence and amount of ischemia can be identified using myocardial perfusion MRI. There is a need to quantitatively compare cardiovascular MRI and cardiovascular CT images to determine the concordance of stress perfusion defects by both modalities with the anatomic information obtained by coronary CT angiography and invasive coronary angiography. There is also a need to compare quantitative stress perfusion MRI, CTA, adenosine stress CT perfusion with simultaneous sestamibi SPECT, and invasive angiography.<br />Thus, the goal of this contract is to procure computer algorithm and programming support for the development of medical image processing software for the application of multimodality cardiac image segmentation, registration, and visualization for the Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging Group at NHLBI.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objective of the Procurement<br />Since coronary CT angiography and stress perfusion MRI provide complimentary information for coronary anatomy and myocardial perfusion information, both modalities are needed to assess coronary artery disease. To fuse the information from both imaging modalities, physicians use assumptions on coronary perfusion territories to determine which specific stenosis is associated with which ischemic region.<br />Due to the high variability between patient's coronary artery anatomies, as well as the uncertain relation between perfusion territories and supplying coronary arteries, there is a need for computer algorithm and software that can integrate, register, and display images from both cardiac CT angiography and MR perfusion imaging. Such computer algorithm and software may also enable integrative and quantitative comparison of complimentary information from multimodality cardiac imaging; such as coronary CT angiography, stress perfusion MRI, stress perfusion CT, sestamibi SPECT, and invasive angiography.</p>
<p>Specific goals for integrative cardiac image analysis may include, but not limited to, the following tasks:<br />&bull; Register cardiac MR perfusion images with cardiac CT angiography images</p>
<p>&bull; Register cardiac MR perfusion images with CT perfusion images, and with SPECT perfusion images</p>
<p><br />Specific computer software and image processing algorithms development for multimodality cardiac image registration include, but not limited to, the following functions:<br />&bull; Develop image enhancement and rectification methods to reduce image noise and correct imaging related distortions. These image processing techniques can be used to provide a better image for qualitative interpretation and can also form important standardization procedures for subsequence automated analysis.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop image segmentation algorithms to delineate structures of interest and to discriminate them from background tissues. This can for example detect and localize common objects or organs of interest or to classify different pixel or tissue groups from multimodality cardiac image dataset.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop computer algorithms to extract equivalent or corresponding features from different cardiac image datasets. The extract image features may for example be object shapes or points or may simply be intensity-based measures. These features form fundamental building blocks for subsequent feature matching between two or more image datasets.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop geometric transformation methods that can map coordinates of pixels or points from one image volume into another. This includes image transformation which involves translation, rotation, and scaling for rigid body types of organs. It also includes affine or polynomial transformation to perform image warping for non-rigid body tissue structures.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop numerical optimization methods to find the best parameters for geometric image transformation. This can be accomplished through an iterative process in which an objective function derived from two images is optimized through numerical procedures. The best transformation parameters can either be computed directly for a closed form solution or searched heuristically as an open form problem.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop validation protocols to evaluate the results of multimodality cardiac image registration. This may include establishing reference standard dataset derived from computer simulation, phantom data, animal data, cadaver data, and patient data to evaluate the accuracy of registration algorithms and results. Such dataset should also incorporate specific requirements and configuration to allow clinical evaluation.</p>
<p>&bull; Develop 3D visualization tools to display the combined image information from multidimensional and multimodality cardiac images. This may include developing and integrating visualization software and hardware to facilitate visual inspection of registered volumetric dataset. This may also include developing graphical user interface and interactive measuring tools for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the registration results.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:<br />Accomplishing successfully the above tasks requires not only excellent software programming skills but also a comprehensive knowledge of computer vision and medical imaging. We need a contracting entity with C/C++, Matlab, IDL, OpenGL, and CUDA programming experience and multi-year experience working in the field of medical image processing and algorithm development.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516 This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) and is designated as full and open competition.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Water Supply and Water Resources Division, under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP), of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13.1, on a firm-fixed price basis, intends to procure the following item: (1) Specifications for a Gas Chromatograph.  
The US-EPA-ORD-NRMRL-WSWRD-UWMB is requesting proposals for a Gas Chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector, thermal conductivity detector, flame ionization detector, autosampler, and necessary plumbing to measure nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, methane, oxygen, dinitrogen, sulfur hexafluoride, and propane in gas samples. 
Minimum Requirements:
The instrument must be configured to separate oxygen from argon and must also be capable of shielding the detectors from contaminates in the sample matrix (e.g., acetylene, water vapor). 
Sample matrix A will contain nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, methane, oxygen, dinitrogen, sulfur hexafluoride, acetylene, and water vapor.  Acetylene and water vapor must be backflushed out of the system to protect the detectors.  This sample matrix will not contain propane, therefore the backflushing protocol does not need to preserve the propane peak.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Acquisition Operations Group, Denver, Colorado, intends to solicit on a sole-source basis to, Colorado Division of Parks and Wildlife, 1313 Sherman Street, Suite 718, Denver, CO  80203-2239.  The requirement is for a Database for the Aquatic Nuisance Species (ANS) Sampling and Monitoring Data Management System.  The purpose of this data management system is to store and manage sampling/monitoring data for zebra and quagga mussels, as well as other invasive species, and related water quality data.  The system consists of a relational database (Microsoft SQL Server) and web-based applications that support data entry, analysis, and reporting activities.
This data management system was developed by the Colorado Division of Parks and Wildlife (CPW) with technical input from Reclamation and other state and federal agencies. The original focus was on invasive aquatic species data for Colorado, but the database can also accommodate the Reclamation Invasive Mussel Detection Project's data from all western states. This data management system will be utilized by several other state and federal agencies to provide a single, consolidated volume of ANS data into a secure and standardized format, enabling faster data retrieval and analysis (such as exploring the relationship between ANS occurrence and water quality), and significantly increase reporting and data-sharing efficiency amongst various state and federal agencies. If Reclamation were to procure or develop another data management system, it would not be compatible with the CPW database system and would not facilitate standardized formatting, efficient data retrieval, analysis or data sharing resulting in a significant loss of research data and cooperation with other state and federal agencies.
The system will consolidate the large volume of ANS data into a more secure and more standardized format, enable faster retrieval (such as exploring the relationship between ANS occurrence and water quality), and significantly increase reporting and data-sharing efficiency.
Colorado Division of Parks and Wildlife 1313 Sherman Street, Suite 718, Denver, CO  80203-2239 is the only known source meeting the above requirements. 
Competition is restricted to only one source per FAR 13.106-1(b). This procurement will be awarded using Simplified Acquisition Procedures at FAR Part 13 with an intended. Anticipated award date is April 30, 2012. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement by 12:00 pm MDT, April 27, 2012 which will be considered by the agency. Responses to this notice shall be submitted to Al Phillips, Contracting Specialist via email to aphillips@usbr.gov.

<DESC>Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation (MARCO)<br />Focus Center Research Project (FCRP)<br /> Research Announcement (RA)<br />Solicitation No. RA S201209
<p>The technical point-of-contact for this effort is the Director, FCRP (fcrp-s201209info@src.org).</p>
<p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is assisting the Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation (MARCO), a not-for-profit subsidiary of the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC),  in publishing its research requirements, the purpose of which is to obtain the widest dissemination of the requirements.  The following information is for those wishing to respond to MARCO's solicitation entitled FCRP Research Announcement, Solicitation RA S201209.</p>
<p>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION<br />The Focus Center Research Program ("FCRP"), a consortium of industrial participants and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ("DARPA"), (the "Consortium"), solicits white papers from U.S. universities for collaborative, multidisciplinary, multi-university research in selected areas of   principal interest.</p>
<p>The goal of this collaborative effort between the Department of Defense and the industrial participants is to increase substantially the unprecedented multi-decade record of uninterrupted performance improvement in information processing power and storage capacity of integrated circuits and related systems.  This historical advance in IC and related systems technologies resulted from research and development efforts that benefitted both the military and industrial sectors.  It has provided the Department of Defense with an unmatched technological edge in advanced weaponry and provided the U.S. economy with the productivity enhancements critical to U.S. economic growth.</p>
<p>The Consortium seeks to address emerging challenges in semiconductor and systems technologies by concentrating resources on high-risk, high-payoff, long-range innovative research to accelerate the productivity growth and performance enhancement of semiconductor integrated circuits and multi-scale systems.  To this end, the FCRP is focused on exploratory research beyond the horizons of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), and seeks to undertake off-Roadmap opportunities.                  <br /> <br />A two phase selection process will be used:</p>
<p>1.	First, a "proposers' conference" will be held to review this solicitation with interested university teams.  A white paper is then requested to outline a university team's proposal for a Center. These white papers will be reviewed by the Consortium, and the most promising will be selected to invite full proposals.  The university teams selected to submit full proposals may be given feedback by the Consortium on ways they could strengthen their proposal to meet the research goals, i.e., there will be an opportunity for these teams to discuss potential collaborations to create combined Centers.</p>
<p>2.	Second, full proposals for multi-university Centers will then be submitted for final selection for award by the FCRP Governing Council of the Consortium.  The selection timeline is given below:</p>
<p>Research Announcement Release	April 23, 2012<br />Bidders' Workshop		May 14, 2012		<br />White Papers Due:		June 15, 2012<br />Response to White Papers		July 9, 2012<br />Full Proposals Due		September 14, 2012<br />Proposals Selected for Award:	October 15, 2012<br />Contracts Completed		January 15, 2013<br />Launch Centers			January 15, 2013</p>
<p>This FCRP will be administered on behalf of the Consortium by the Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation ("MARCO").  MARCO is a not-for-profit, special purpose entity established to support the Consortium participants.  It operates under the direction of the FCRP Governing Council and in support of the FCRP Science Advisory Board.  The Consortium participants will evaluate all proposals submitted in accordance with this Research Announcement and the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet (http://www.src.org/compete/s201209/).   Selection of proposals for award shall be made by the Governing Council of the Consortium.</p>
<p>This solicitation is open to all U.S. universities and shall be conducted on a competitive basis.  Universities are encouraged to join together to achieve the depth and scope needed to address the technical content of this Research Announcement.  Proposed collaboration among PIs and universities, in the form of Centers or otherwise, should identify a lead university and lead PI for purposes of an award and consummation of a sponsored research agreement with the Consortium.</p>
<p>As a participating member of the Consortium, DARPA is bringing the FCRP Research Announcement to the attention of U.S. universities and is utilizing its own website (www.DARPA.mil) and the official federal acquisition opportunities website (www.FedBizOpps.gov) for this purpose.  In addition, this Research Announcement has been posted at http://www.src.org/compete/s201209/.</p>
<p>This Research Announcement represents a new phase in the continuing FCRP.  The Consortium intends to continue with the solicitation, contracting and reporting requirements that it has used in earlier program phases.</p>
<p>Cross-sharing between universities is strongly encouraged, but only U.S. institutions of higher education or their associated research institutions will be considered for funding.</p>
<p>The Consortium seeks proposals addressing one or more of the following seven focus technology areas which are organized into two major thrusts:</p>
<p>NEXT:  Highly Complex Systems</p>
<p>Technology Areas for NEXT - The mission of the NEXT thrust area is to enable highly complex systems with capabilities well beyond those available today, i.e., to augment beyond the "sum of the parts."</p>
<p>1.	High performance analog devices for high speed wireless, THz electronics for imaging, sensing, novel power devices:  New analog and mixed signal circuit architectures and techniques are needed that enable the efficient transmission (generation), reception (sensing), manipulation <br />and processing of analog signals (information) as well as conversion of analog signals to the digital domain.</p>
<p>2.	Vehicle and Distributed Sensor Networks:  Designs and implementation of integrated modular architecture (IMA) communication networks (i.e. distributed systems) are needed, including methodology and tools to support the choice of synchronous/asynchronous communication systems and the co-design of functionality and implementation platforms.</p>
<p>3.	Computing System Architectures based on CMOS technology:  Research is needed on highly parallel computing including data and interconnection architecture for nonconventional computing systems based on CMOS.</p>
<p>4.	Tools and methods for design, verification, and predictive modeling, including physical modeling:  Research is needed that explores and develops the tools that will enable realization of new systems, components, and technologies that will be developed in the 10 year timeframe.</p>
<p>ACCEL:  Semiconductor Technologies beyond CMOS</p>
<p>Technology Areas for ACCEL - The mission of the ACCEL thrust area is to identify and accelerate progress for new mainstream technologies beyond digital CMOS</p>
<p>1.	Nonconventional material systems: Research is needed for improved and novel materials that enable three basic technologies: analog, memory and logic devices.</p>
<p>2.	Quantum engineered devices and new sensors and transducers:  Next generation technologies based on exploiting quantum level physics to provide capabilities well beyond state-of-the-art.  Efforts should accelerate the integration of new material systems and quantum phenomena as the basis for the era beyond CMOS based devices.  Preference will be given to ideas that have a clear path towards stable use in applications, e.g., at room temperature and with minimal shielding.  Research is needed to identify new devices and sensors that can move the integrated circuit for computation and analog processing into the era of Beyond CMOS circuits.</p>
<p><br />3.	Integrated circuits and computing architectures based on novel devices including both digital and analog:  This research topic is chartered to find a new energy efficient architecture to replace the Von Neumann Computer Architecture and to optimize the overall performance and energy usage by optimally partitioning the computational system between signal processing in the analog domain at an I/O interface, and computation in the digital domain.</p>
<p>Each of these areas is of equal technical importance for proposal purposes.  Offerors may propose innovative research in one or more areas.  Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the RA S201209 FCRP Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced above.</p>
<p>Additionally, a separate solicitation may be offered at a later date for exploratory, individual project proposals in areas related to these thrusts.</p>
<p>PROGRAM SCOPE <br />Following proposal selection, awards pursuant to sponsored research agreements with the Consortium will be made as appropriate, for base periods of up to five years, to accommodate student education and provide adequate time for discovery and progress in new areas.  The research is expected to start in January 2013.  There will be a checkpoint at 2.5 years to allow for re-direction as needed within the Centers; this will not be a re-competition.  Overall program funding may reach a level of $40M per annum, depending on research progress and availability of funds.  The funds may not be equally divided among Awardees.  The technical point-of-contact for this effort is the Director, FCRP (fcrp-s201209info@src.org).</p>
<p>GENERAL INFORMATION<br />Proposers should review the document entitled "RA S201209 FCRP Proposer Information Pamphlet", which provides further information on areas of interest, the submission, evaluations, funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.

<DESC>INTRODUCTIONThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Launch Service Program (LSP)invites you to submit a response to this inquiry to assist in the planning anddevelopment of potential launch opportunities for Cubesat missions on-boardNASA-sponsored Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) launch services. LSP serves as theAgency's provider of domestic expendable launch services and advisor on expendable launchsystems. LSP oversees mission integration, mission analysis, launch vehicle production,and down range telemetry assets at various domestic and international locations. Theprogram manages launch site activities at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS)and Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB). Additionally, the program supports, when necessary,launches from other locations such as Kodiak, Alaska, Kwajalein Island, and the WallopsFlight Facility.   The objectives of this RFI are: 1) to invite industry to submit information that willallow NASA to assess various design alternatives for orbital debris mitigation optionsapplicable to Cubesat missions in Low Earth Orbit (LEO); 2) to improve NASA's knowledgeof industry's capability and viability; and 3) to improve the overall understanding ofCubesat mission designs consistent with NPR 8715.6A, NASA Procedural Requirements forLimiting Orbital Debris, NASA STD 8719.14, Process for Limiting Orbital Debris, and NASAHandbook 8719.14, Handbook for Limiting Orbital Debris.BACKGROUNDCubesats are a new generation of satellites whose unique small size and relative low costallow small private companies and institutions to launch their own projects into space.The missions typically end within one year of launch and the Cubesats remain in theheavily populated LEO as inactive spacecraft. As auxiliary payloads, Cubesats cannotcurrently be equipped with propulsion or pressurized systems and must be 1.33 kg per 10cmx 10cm x 10cm unit (up to 3 units). These design restrictions, in conjunction with agencyorbital debris requirements, have thus far limited the types of orbits that can beachieved. While all orbital debris requirements need to be addressed and met, the mostcommon requirements affecting Cubesats are risk of on-orbit collision (4.5) and orbitlifetime (4.6). NASA STD 8719.14 states in requirement 4.5-1 there must be less than1:1,000 probability of collision with any existing space objects which are greater than10 cm. Additionally, placing a Cubesat in an orbit above approximately 650 km circularviolates requirement 4.6-1, which states that the orbital lifetime for anynon-functioning spacecraft within LEO must be less than 25 years, if it is not placedinto an otherwise acceptable disposal orbit.SPECIFIC INFORMATION SOLICITEDGiven the parameters described above, Respondents to this RFI are requested to comment ontechnology developed by industry for post-mission disposal of Cubesats through methodsincluding, but not limited to, atmospheric reentry, maneuvering to disposable orbits, anddirect retrieval. In addition, please include the following information with yoursubmittal:	Organization name, address, principal activity of organization, primary point ofcontact, and telephone number.	Capabilities and qualifications statement that addresses your ability to provideexpertise relevant to the implementation of Cubesat missions.	Summary of orbital debris mitigation concept, including how it is uniquelysuitable for the low-cost Cubesat mission approach.	Technology development required by the submitted concept/idea including (ifappropriate) the maturity level of the respondents technologies in terms of heritage,with supporting evidence for the claimed heritage, and an estimate of investments todate.	Other pertinent information that the Respondent deems necessary.RESPONSE INSTRUCTIONSThe requested responses are for information and planning purposes only.  NASA does notintend to post information or questions received to any website or public accesslocation, or notify individual respondents of evaluation results.  Feedback to this RFImay be utilized in formulating the Governments acquisition strategy and documents. Respondents deemed qualified will be considered in any resultant solicitation for therequirement.  Responses may be submitted as papers, presentations, or videos with a limit of ten (10)pages, twenty (20) slides, or five (5) minutes respectively.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley, Jefferson Lab, and the National Institute of Aerospace have jointlydeveloped a new method for manufacturing boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs). BNNTs are adirect analog of carbon nanotubes, with superior properties for many applications. Theyare as strong as carbon nanotubes (within a few percentage points) and are good thermalconductors. However, they have a much higher service temperature, are highlyelectroactive, shield neutron radiation, have a more active surface chemistry, arenon-cytotoxic (in tests on human cells), and are naturally white (can be dyed). BNNTsproduced by this method have far superior morphology than those previously available. Thenew tubes have a nearly perfect crystalline structure with one wall to just a few, andare extremely long. Because of the length of the tubes and the white color, the rawmaterial produced by the new method has the physical appearance of cotton.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055. Please indicate thedate and title of the FBO notice and include your company and contact information.RTI is responsible for aggregating and acknowledging all responses.  These responses areprovided to members of NASA Langleys Innovative Partnerships Office within the SRO forthe purpose of promoting public awareness of our technology products, and conductingpreliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for futurelicensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, SRO willfollow the formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register as required.  Nofollow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley offers you a deployable and stowable mechanical design for filling thecavity behind the leading-edge slat (i.e., slat cove), when it is extended upon landingan aircraft. Aerodynamic flow over an unfilled cavity typically exhibits stronglyunsteady behavior that is a source of aeroacoustic noise. Conventional leading-edge slatdevices for high lift are a good example of such geometric and flow conditions and are aprominent source of airframe noise. Experimental and computational results have shownthat a slat-cove filler device could significantly reduce the noise produced by slatstructures. The proposed structural concept is simple and will enable autonomousachievement of the desired deployed shape. The design will facilitate a clean cruiseconfiguration with minimal weight addition to the aircraft. NASA is seeking developmentpartners and potential licensees.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley has developed a novel method of depositing metal and metal oxidenanoparticles onto various substrates (see ACS Nano, 3(4), 871884 [2009]). It is rapid,scalable, and green since it does not require reducing agents or solvents. The processinvolves first mixing and then heating a metal salt (usually an acetate) with the desiredsubstrate. Heating can be done by conventional thermal or microwave ovens. Conventionalthermal processing takes several hours and requires an inert atmosphere, usuallynitrogen. With microwave heating, the process is complete in a matter of seconds. Themetal or metal oxide nanoparticles have potential use in catalysis. Metal particles oncarbon for catalyzing the adsorption of mercury from the effluent of coal-fired powerplants has been investigated (Energy & Fuels 23, 15121517 [2009]).

<DESC>This solicitation is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. 

MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS: The Government is issuing this sources-sought announcement as part of a market survey.  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division located at the Naval Support Activity, Crane, IN is looking for companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS), Non-Developmental Items (NDI), or near NDI for an improved 12.7mm multipurpose (MP) armor piercing high explosive incendiary (APHEI) ammunition cartridge and a non-dud producing 12.7 mm marking cartridge that have accuracies that are better than the accuracy of the MK 211 12.7mm MP APHEI ammunition cartridge and trajectories that match the trajectory of the MK 211 12.7mm MP APHEI ammunition cartridge.
  The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) may apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) project to evaluate candidates.  USSOCOM is interested in vendors who are currently producing a 12.7mm MP APHEI cartridge that is more accurate than the current MK 211 MOD 0 DODIC A606 ammunition cartridge used by USSOCOM and a 12.7mm non-dud producing cartridge that matches its trajectory.  

Responses are requested of those suppliers who can provide either ammunition cartridge ready for test and demonstration purposes and that can meet the following criteria:

 The Improved 12.7mm MP APHEI ammunition must meet the following 550 meter accuracy of a ten shot group requirement: a Standard Deviation of 100mm or less and an Extreme Spread of 250mm or less.
  The accuracy of the cartridge at 1,000 meter is also of interest.  It must be able to penetrate 10.6mm armor plate RHA BHN 321-375, at an angle of impact of 45 NATO.  A projectile must produce a minimum of 10 fragments when fired against a Dural plate target, thickness 2mm, at an angle of impact 0 NATO and a range of 200 meters in a 1.25mm steel witness plate placed 1.2 meters behind the target.  The incendiary effects must be equivalent to the MK 211 ammunition cartridge.  There will be safety requirements/standards that the vendors will have to meet.

The 12.7mm Non-Dud producing ammunition cartridge must meet the following 550 meter accuracy of a ten shot group requirement: a Standard Deviation of 120mm or less and an Extreme Spread of 280mm.
  It must match the trajectory of the MK 211 MOD 0 DODIC A606 ammunition cartridge, produce a signature flash when hitting the target without possessing the high explosive that can produce duds, without the secondary incendiary that increases fire starting capability, and without the penetration capability and fragmentation pattern that increases the risk of collateral damage. The accuracy of the cartridge at 1,000 meter is also of interest.  There will be safety requirements/standards that the vendors will have to meet. 

All interested parties are encouraged to submit company and product literature, white paper, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, and an estimated cost for price of test articles and production units, for the Governments consideration by 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on 17 May 2012.

The technical point of contact for this effort is Mr.
 Del Durig, Adelbert.durig@navy.mil, or 812-854-6249.  The mailing address is: NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane, ATTN: Mr. Del Durig, Code JXNN. Bldg 3422, 300 Highway 361, Crane IN 47522-5001.

NOTICE:  The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 12 months before your offer is evaluated.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES: Please review the solicitation document for clause changes.

<p>The purpose of this procurement is to procure Text and Data Analytics (TDA) Software (BRAND NAME OR EQUAL TO PRODUCT) for a twelve (12) month period. This software is required to assist investigators and analysts in analyzing and presenting findings of voluminous amount of unstructured and structured evidentiary material.</p>
<p>1. DESCRIPTION OF WORK:<br />The Government requires a comprehensive analytical tool, TDA Solution software, to assist investigators and analysts in analyzing and presenting findings of voluminous amounts of unstructured and structured evidentiary material used in investigations conducted by FDA-Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA-OCI). As described below, the TDA solution must be capable to extract entities and identify relationships with full integration of a visualization tool to present such findings. Where indicated, the TDA Solution must utilize "out of the box" functionality to accomplish tasks. Due to the sensitivity of the evidentiary material, open source plug-ins or software cannot be utilized.</p>
<p>2. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:<br />Text and Data Extraction and Classification:<br />a. The TDA Solution must be able to process various Optical Character Recognition or searchable file formats such as but not limited to PDFs, Text Files, XML, Microsoft Office formats, and various email formats.

<p>b. The TDA Solution must have "out of the box" functionality to extract and classify text and data by entities.</p>
<p>The TDA Solution must be capable of accepting custom libraries or dictionaries as designated by FDA-OCI. Once these libraries and dictionaries are incorporated, the TDA Solution must be able to extract and classify the data. This includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceuticals, food products and additives, and medical devices.</p>
<p>Text/Data Parsing:<br />The TDA Solution must be able to parse fields containing structured data and extract and classify data by entity of the parsed fields on at least five forms designation by FDA-OCI. The data extraction from this process will be combined with extractions from unstructured data.</p>
<p>Relationship Identification:<br />The TDA Solution must be capable to use "out of the box" functionality to identify relationships between entities. This includes "out of the box" functionality to identify and tag financial relationships between entities. <br /><br />Sentiment of Written Communication:<br />The TDA Solution must have "out of the box" capability to determine the sentiment of written statements in unstructured text. The sentiment analysis includes the following:</p>
<p>&bull;Sentiment, characteristics of the entities of the sentiment, attributes<br />&bull;Sentiment, problem expressed by the sentiment, major, minor<br />&bull;Sentiment, requests and questions associated with the sentiment, new, existing, contact<br />&bull;Sentiment, strong positive, week positive, neutral, weak negative, strong negative</p>
<p>Data Cleansing and Disambiguation:<br />The TDA Solution must include the "out of the box" functionality to determine judgments regarding disambiguation of different but similar description of entities. This includes determining that variations of a name or an address are actually one person and address, respectively. Further, the TDA Solution must be capable to standardize this data and combine into single or reduced entity identification.</p>
<p>Search and Viewer:<br />The TDA Solution must include "out of the box" functionality to search, discover, and analyze by various methods and techniques.</p>
<p>Once entities are extracted and relationships identified, the TDA Solution must be capable of pointing to the source image containing the entity or relationship. This includes a viewer that will show the results of an entity or relationship search in PDF and Text File formats. The viewer will highlight the specific location of the entity or relationship in the PDF and Text File.</p>
<p>Visualization Tool:<br />The TDA Solution must include a fully integrated visualization tool with the text and data extraction and relationship identification as described above. The vendor must present documentation to demonstrate that the tool is integrated with these attributes as part of the award. Development and integration of a visualization tool with text and data extraction and relationship identification during configuration, testing and deployment of the TDA Solution is not permitted. The visualization tool must allow for the automated extraction of identified entities and relationships into the visualization tool. This includes icons or labels to identify entities and relationships. This must also include the "out of the box" identification and labeling of financial transactions between entities. The visualization tool must allow the end user to search by entities and to crate visualization reports or graphical representations of the search results. The above described viewer will be fully integrated with the visualization tool, as it will allow the end user view the source images based on the search criteria. The visualization tool must be capable of allowing the end user to filter results in order to focus on key investigative findings. The visualization tool must also be able to demonstrate results using link analysis, graphical, statistical, and geographical charts or tables.</p>
<p>Testing, Training and Knowledge Transfer, and Technical Assistance:<br />The TDA Solution software award should include hours for government usability testing prior to production. This includes creating a testing and development environment. In addition, prior to production, the vendor must provide 80 hours of knowledge transfer to FDA-OCI or designated user on the use of the TDA Solution. Further, the vendor must provide training to at least five (5) individuals identified by FDA-OCI on the use of the TDA Solution to include the text and data extraction and relationship and visualization tool components. The vendor must provide a total of 100 hours annually of technical assistance for troubleshooting and fine-tuning of the TDA Solution software. <br /><br />2.

<p>***The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase an upgrade of an X-ray diffractometer with a Twin Mirror Arrangement:</p>
<p>****All interested Contractor's shall provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Upgrade of an X-ray diffractometer with a Twin Mirror Arrangement (TMA) for Cu Ka-radiation. The hardware must meet or exceed all of the minimum specifications identified herein. All equipment must be new. Used or remanufactured equipment will not be considered for award.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The X-Ray Metrology project in the Ceramics Division of the Material Measurement Laboratory provides Standard Reference Materials for calibration of X-ray scattering instruments to customers all over the world. Approximately 4% of all standards sold from NIST come from this project. In order to develop and certify SRMs which are relevant to our customers, NIST has developed instruments which are at least an order of magnitude more accurate than commercial X-ray diffraction instrumentation. NIST has also developed first-principles modeling software to expand our traceability from the measurement to the measurand. This additional hardware will provide additional instrument configurations that will permit the NIST specific research to aid in the calibration of commercial instruments in the field. Also, other configurations made available by this hardware will offer a unique measurement capabilities which can then by evaluated for their efficacy in addressing measurement issues relevant to the diffraction and reflectometry communities.</p>
<p>The TMA hardware must meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>The system shall consist of two assemblies containing the mirror optics themselves, one for the incident beam and second for the scattered beam, which constitute stand-alone structures that can be mounted on a customized, pre-existing X-ray diffractometer at NIST.</p>
<p>Specification 1: Mirror optic for incident beam</p>
<p>a. Optical active width not less than 17.5 mm<br />b. Focal distance specific to NIST hardware, 100 mm<br />c. Parallel beam width not less than 0.7 mm<br />d. Mean reflectivity not less than 80% (Cu K&alpha; radiation)<br />e. Beam divergence of not greater than 0.03&#730;</p>
<p>Specification 2: Mirror optic assembly for incident beam</p>
<p>a. Mounting plate to allow assembly to be installed, in correct alignment to X-ray line source, on a Bruker AXS(formally Siemens AXS) D5000 X-ray tube shield<br />b. Mirror enclosure must provide shielding for X-rays to prevent detectable leakage<br />c.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>Realism: A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, <br />specific hours, and material kinds and quantity in each contractor's proposed price proposal.

<p>Price Risk: The Government will evaluate the risk associated with pricing schemes given the<br />proposed pricing schemes, terms and conditions.

<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award</p>
<p>The Government may conduct a price realism evaluation in order to determine if the overall price<br />proposed is:<br />(1) Realistic for the work to be performed;<br />(2) Reflects a clear understanding of the requirements; and<br />(3) Are consistent with the various elements of the Offeror's technical proposal.</p>

Offeror's are cautioned to submit their proposal on the most favorable basis, since the Government reserves the right to make an award without further negotiations or discussions.</p>
<p>RATING METHODOLOGY</p>
<p>The Government Evaluation Team members will independently rate the strengths and weaknesses of each Offeror's technical proposal information. Each of the developed evaluation factors will be adjectivally rated as Acceptable, or Unacceptable. Only the Past Performance factor may be rated as neutral</p>
<p>A rating of unacceptable on any one factor or subfactor will result in an Offeror's proposal not <br />being considered for award.</p>
<p>The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:</p>
<p>ACCEPTABLE - Satisfies evaluation criteria. Good probability of success; weakness can be readily corrected.</p>
<p>UNACCEPTABLE - Substantially deficient in addressing the mandatory requirements, i.e., fails to minimally satisfy the evaluation criteria, significant deficiencies, not correctable without a major revision to the proposal.</p>
<p>NEUTRAL - This rating shall only be applied to the PAST PERFORMANCE factor. A neutral rating is neither favorable nor unfavorable.</p>
<p>Assigned ratings will reflect the consensus developed by the evaluation team's assessment of the<br />technical proposal for accomplishing the Government's objectives.</p>
<p>Price proposals will be evaluated in order to determine that the price is fair and reasonable</p>

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation which will be considered by the agency.<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3675.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

Access Privilege Management
Companies choosing to participate in the RAPIDGate Program will have streamlined access onto the installation. Participants will have access through all gates that size permits (Main Gate, Gate 5, Gate 15 and Gate 20) and will only be subject to RANDOM vehicle inspections. At the Main Gate RAPIDGate participants will be able to utilize either lane, enabling fast access onto the installation through that gate. 
 Companies choosing not to participate in the RAPIDGate Program will be required to access the installation through the Main Gate, utilizing the commercial lane only. To enter the installation a pass is required for each person. Currently the maximum pass period is 30 days.  Effective December 1, 2010, maximum day pass will be reduced to 14 days and on April 1, 2011 only a one day pass will be issued.  To obtain a pass, you will be required to go to Vehicle Registration at the Welcome Center, show identification (i.e. driver?s license), vehicle registration, proof of insurance, contract award letter and/or bill of lading to obtain a pass to the installation. NO PASSES WILL BE ISSUED AT THE GATE. Vehicle Registration hours are Monday ? Friday 7:30a.m. ? 4:00p.m.  Significant delays may result from choosing to access the installation by obtaining a one day pass.  In which The Government will not be held responsible for any access delays.  Contractor may not at any time request consideration as a result of choosing to access the installation using the day pass process.  
Enrollment/Registration
Companies that service Fort McCoy may enroll in the RAPIDGate Program by calling 1-877-RAPIDGate (1-877-727-4342).  The Program will confirm with the installation that the company has legitimate business on the installation. Once the company has enrolled, its employees can register at the self-service Registration Station located at the Fort McCoy Welcome Center.
The RAPIDGate Program confirms the individual?s employment status with the company, and then performs identity authentication and background screening.  Employees who qualify are issued a personalized RAPIDGate ID Badge.  The Program performs background screening on a regular basis to verify continued eligibility in the Program.
Questions about the Fort McCoy RAPIDGate Program should be addressed to info@rapidgate.com with the subject line RE: RAPIDGate Program, or to the Physical Security Branch, Directorate of Emergency Services at 608-388-4694.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is 1100737. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-56 dated April 2, 2012.</p>
<p>Funds are not presently available for this requirement. Award will be subject to if/when appropriated funds are available.<br /><br />The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is- 334510- Electromedical and Electrotherapeutic Apparatus Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees and is issued as full and open competition.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) requires a high frequency ultrasound system with post-warranty service/maintenance options inclusive of all parts, labor and travel for the entire system.</p>
<p>The High-Frequency Ultrasound System will be used to image anatomical and physiological features of small animals used as model systems for human disease and injury. The high frequency ultrasound system should enable the researcher to obtain in vivo anatomical, functional, physiological and molecular data simultaneously, in real-time and with resolution down to 30 &mu;m.</p>
<p>High frequency transducers <br />&bull; Transducers shall be included capable of frequencies ranging from 15 MHz to 55 MHz <br />&bull; Adjustable focus depths for each transducer.<br />&bull; Each high frequency transducer should be able to deliver a usable frame rate of 300-400 frames per second</p>
<p>Integrated imaging station <br />&bull; Allows secure positioning of the animal (rats and mice) on a heated handling table, which maintains the animal's physiological body temperature and overall physiological function. <br />&bull; Integrated platform with an isoflurane-based anesthesia system that can be connected to oxygen or air.</p>
<p>Monitoring of physiological function and data <br />&bull; ECG, heart rate, temperature and respiration should be recorded and displayed on the monitor screen alongside the images. This information should be able to be exported and saved. <br />&bull; ECG and Respiration gating can be controlled by the user.</p>
<p>M-Mode <br />&bull; M-Mode imaging should produce quantifiable images to characterize moving anatomy, such as a cardiac wall motion by selecting a line of the B-Mode image and observing it over time. <br />&bull; Should be able to sample volume size down to 50 microns <br />&bull; Should allow the user to steer the sample volume to any angle the user chooses.<br /><br />Doppler Mode Capabilities<br />&bull; The equipment should be capable of using Color Doppler Imaging to produce an image of directional flow in blood vessels. The system should overlay colors on the image of the blood vessels to represent the speed and direction of blood flow through the vessels. <br />&bull; In Pulsed-wave Doppler (PW) Mode, the transducer should be able to detect motion and then show the readings on screen in a spectral display. <br />&bull; The sampling rate for PW Doppler should range from 1-2 kHz to 125 kHz; and be able to detect velocities from a few mm/s to approximately 6 m/s. <br />&bull; The sweep speed parameter should be selectable within a range from 0.25 seconds at 4000 Hz to 5.1 seconds at 200 Hz.<br />&bull; 3D Power Doppler Mode will collect Power Doppler data during a 3D-Mode acquisition and be able to reconstruct a 3D volume that is integrated with the surrounding B-Mode 3D volume.</p>
<p>3D Imaging <br />&bull; 3D-Mode imaging should provide tools to create and manipulate three-dimensional renderings and make volumetric measurements of objects viewed with high-resolution ultrasound. <br />&bull; Acquires a series of 2-dimensional "slices" (as small as 10 &mu;m) and assembles them into a 3D data set that can then be visualized and manipulated. Targets (for example, tumor growth) can be segmented and volumetric measurements made. <br />&bull; 3D imaging can be used in B-Mode, Power Doppler Mode or Contrast mode imaging procedures. <br />3D acquisition functionality allows for precise control of step size, range and slice thickness. This functionality can be integrated with ECG and respiration gating to suppress heart and respiratory errors. <br />&bull; Range = # of slices x step size. <br />&bull; Maximum number of 500 slices.</p>
<p>Contrast Imaging <br />&bull; A suite of software analysis and quantification tools should be provided that enables perfusion imaging and targeted/molecular imaging research applications. <br />&bull; Software tools should allow quantification of relative blood volume, blood perfusion and vascular density. <br />&bull; Should be capable of molecular imaging studies: visualization and quantification of endothelial cell markers involved in angiogenesis and inflammation in vivo, in real-time. <br />&bull; Should be capable of detecting contrast agents such as microbubbles.</p>
<p>Post-processing tool for perfusion and targeted signal analysis <br />&bull; Perfusion parameters are derived from a curve fitting algorithm for both bolus kinetics and replenishment kinetics following destruction reperfusion <br />&bull; Perfusion parameters include a series of calculations for amplitude, time and combination of amplitude and time <br />&bull; Spatial rendering is available in the form of parametric maps <br />&bull; Data can be exported in TIFF, BMP, video files and CSV formats</p>

<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Amendment 001</span><br />Solicitation SB1341-12-RQ-0245<br /></strong><br /><br />The purposes of this amendment are as follows:
<p>1.	To extend the response deadline to April 26, 2012 at 10:00 am Eastern Time;<br />2.	To change Section III Schedule of Required Items in the attached Solicitation document to show that Offerors shall NOT include a warranty on the new hardware being requested, and that Offerors should include one year of software maintenance/support for any software being requested.  The reason that the hardware warranty is being removed from this requirement is that the new hardware will take on the warranty of the existing EMC hardware that it is installed into.  The attached document entitled "Amendment 001 Solicitation SB1341-12-RQ-0245" shows these changes and shall be used as the official solicitation document form the date of issuance of this amendment.<br />3.	To answer questions posed by a potential Offeror. The questions and the official NIST responses are detailed below:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions &amp; Responses:</span></p>
<p>1.	Please ask the end user to clarify which CLINS need installation and which ones do not.</p>
<p>Response:  The solicitation states which CLINs require installation and which do not.  CLINs 0007 and 0008 each contain multiple items within the CLIN.  However, it is clearly stated which items within each CLIN require installation and which do not.  Please refer to the Amendment 001 Solicitation SB1341-12-RQ-0245 document for details on which CLINs require installation.</p>
<p>2.	We also need to understand how if all we need to do in installation (Rack and Stack )?  Is there a Statement of Work associated with the project?</p>
<p>Response:  NIST will respond to this question in a forthcoming amendment as soon as possible.<br />END OF TEXT.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following provisions apply to this acquisition:</p>
<p>FAR 52-212-1 Instructions to offerors-Commercial items</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2, EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) This provision is incorporated by reference, and paragraph (a) is modified to read as follows:</p>
<p>(a) This is a competitive best value source selection in which proposals will be evaluated on an integrated assessment of Price, Technical Acceptability, and Present/Past Performance. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements and will provide the best value to the Government. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(i) Initially, offers shall be ranked according to evaluated prices. The price evaluation will be made on the basis of the total price of all line items including the corresponding CLINs under Options. An offeror must therefore propose on all line items including the options (See paragraph (b) below).</p>
<p>Price Evaluation for Utilization of FAR 52.217-8, Extension of Services Clause: In order to meet the requirements of FAR Part 6 and FAR Part 17, the price equivalent to the 6 months extension of services authorized by FAR 52.217-8 will be evaluated separately and will not be factored as part of the total evaluated price for award. The Government will calculate prices for a quantity equivalent to 6 months by prorating prices offered for CLINs 0001 including the corresponding CLINs under Options of FAR 52.217-9 and evaluate such prices for reasonableness.</p>
<p>(ii) The lowest priced proposal will then be evaluated for Technical Acceptability to ensure that the offeror understands and is technically capable of performing the requirement. Proposals will be evaluated on a "met" or "failed" basis. To achieve a "met" rating, the offer shall submit copies of all required business licenses necessary to accomplish the work described in the Performance Work Statement (Solicitation Attachment #2), Japanese Public Law, and Japanese Environmental Governing Regulations. Offerors that do not send in all of their required business certificates prior to the solicitation closing date (23 Apr 2012) will be rated as "failed." Proposals that are rated as "failed" for Technical Acceptability shall not be considered for award and the next lowest priced proposal will be evaluated for technical acceptability.</p>
<p>(iii) The lowest priced technically acceptable offeror will then be evaluated for Present/Past Performance. Using Present/Past Performance Questionnaire, the Government shall seek performance information on the offerors based on (1) the references provided by the offerors and (2) data independently obtained from governmental and commercial sources. The purpose of the Present/Past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's performance risk (i.e., the Government's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully performing the effort described in this solicitation), based on the offeror's demonstrated Present/Past Performance on relevant contracts. Relevancy definitions are listed below in paragraph (a)(v)(B)(1)(2). Present/Past Performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement may be evaluated. When relevant performance record indicates performance problems, the Government will consider the number and severity of the problems and the appropriateness and effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised). The Government may review more recent contracts or performance evaluations to ensure corrective actions have been implemented and to evaluate their effectiveness. The performance confidence assessment process will result in one of two overall risk assessments:</p>
<p>Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown.<br />Not Acceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>If an offeror's performance record is found to be Not Acceptable, that offeror shall not be considered for award and the next lowest price technically acceptable offeror shall be evaluated.</p>
<p>(iv) In evaluating Present/Past Performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(v) Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in paragraph (a)(v)(A)(1) below. Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of Present/Past Performance Information) or respond to adverse Present/Past Performance Information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the Contracting Officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p><br />A. Present/Past Performance Information: Only references for same or similar type contracts desired. Submit originals. The response shall consist of (1) Present/Past Performance Reference List and (2) Present/Past Performance Questionnaire.</p>
<p>(1) Present/Past Performance Reference List: Present/Past Performance Reference List (Solicitation Attachment # 4) shall be used and submitted from offerors to Eric Schmitt, 374 CONS/LGCB, by either e-mail at eric.schmitt.1@us.af.mil (alternate Mikiko Owada at mikiko.owada.jp@us.af.mil) or FAX: 011-81-42552-9846, not later than 23 Apr 2012 to match the information of Present/Past Performance Questionnaire as required in below paragraph (2). Offerors shall submit the reference list of three contracts performed (on-going or completed) as prime contractor, subcontractor, joint ventures and/or teaming partners of the most relevant contracts (similar in scope, size and complexity) for US Government agencies, Government of Japan or its political subdivisions, or commercial customers within the last three years of this solicitation release date. Furnish the following information for each reference on the list of contracts information:</p>
<p>1. Name of contracting activity (e.g. Government Agency/Company name)<br />2. Point of Contact (POC), Contracting Officer and/or Contract Administrator's phone/FAX number, and e-mail address (if available) <br />3. Contract number and project title<br />4. Contract Type (e.g. Firm-Fixed Price, IDIQ, Requirements type)<br />5. Total contract value<br />6. Performance period (e.g. date/month/year through date/month/year)<br />7. Description of contract work performed<br />8. Contracting Officer's name and phone number<br />9. Government Inspector/commercial project manager and phone number<br />10. List of major subcontractors if applicable<br /><br />In addition, the offeror may provide information on problems encountered on the contracts identified in paragraph (a)(v)(A)(1) above and corrective actions taken to resolve these problems. This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk.</p>
<p>(2) Present/Past Performance Questionnaire: The Government requires the Present/Past Performance Information of the contracts identified in Present/Past Performance Reference List from each contracting activity or commercial activities. The offeror shall send out the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire (See Solicitation Attachment # 5) to respective Points of Contact (POCs) of contracting activity identified in Present/Past Performance Reference List. The responsibility to send out the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire rests solely with the offeror - i.e., it shall not be delegated to any other entity. Once the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire is completed by your POCs, the information contained therein shall be considered sensitive and shall not be releasable. Present/Past Performance Questionnaire shall be sent directly back to 374 CONS/LGCB from evaluating agencies/companies, not later than 23 Apr 2012 by either e-mail eric.schmitt@yokota.af.mil (alternate Mikiko Owada at mikiko.owada.jp@us.af.mil) or FAX: 011-81-42552-9846. Offerors are responsible for ensuring that their reference sources receive the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire in time to complete and return the Present/Past Performance Questionnaire to 374th Contracting Squadron. No Present/Past Performance Questionnaire will be accepted directly from the offeror being evaluated. The Government will evaluate the quality and extent of offeror's experience deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. The Government will use information submitted by the offeror and other sources such as other Federal Government offices and commercial sources, to assess experience.</p>
<p>B. Present/Past Performance Evaluation:</p>
<p><br />(1) Present/Past Performance evaluation will be performed based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Recency: Each contract will be confirmed whether the contract has been completed during the past three years from this solicitation release date, or is currently in progress.</p>
<p>2. Relevancy: Submit information on contracts that you consider relevant in demonstrating your ability to perform the proposed effort. Include rationale supporting your assertion of relevance. Offerors are required to explain what aspects of the contracts are deemed relevant to the proposed effort, and to what aspects of the proposed effort they relate. This may include a discussion of efforts accomplished by the offeror to resolve problems encountered on prior contracts as well as past efforts to identify and manage program risk. Relevant contracts (similar in scope, size and complexity) may include the work requirement(s) listed in Description of Services under paragraph 1 of the PWS. A relevancy determination of the offeror's Present/Past Performance as prime contractor, subcontractor, joint ventures, and/or teaming partners will be made. Higher relevancy will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy score for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevancy. The following relevancy definitions apply:</p>
<p>Very Relevant: Present/Past Performance effort involved essentially the same scope and size of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Relevant: Present/Past Performance effort involved much of the same or similar scope and size of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant: Present/Past Performance effort involved some of the same or similar scope and size of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>

<DESC><p>Anticipate release of final RFP in mid May 2012 with a closing date of late June 2012.<br /><br />To provide systems and modular furniture as well as demountable walls, to include all panels, work surfaces, storage, and electric components. The requirement also includes services needed for professional design, delivery and installation. The requirement includes Air Force (AF) Military Construction (MILCON), Government Purchase Card (GPC), and AF contract spend. The scope of this effort is the Continental United States (CONUS) AF installations.</p>
<p>The Enterprise Sourcing Group (ESG) at Wright Patterson AFB is announcing its intent to solicit proposals under Request for Proposals (RFP) FA8057-12-R-0001 to purchase System and Modular Furniture for all CONUS U.S. Air Force active duty and reserve installations. The Government anticipates awarding a target of four contracts to monolithic &amp; stackable panel systems manufacturers (who can also manufacture or team for demountable wall requirements) as a result of this RFP. The Air Force wishes to leverage existing industry practices by using established manufacturer-dealer relationships. When the Final RFP is released, all potential offerors should carefully review the instructions in FAR 52.212-1 and its addendum as well as the evaluation criteria described in FAR 52.212-2 and its addendum.</p>
<p>The ESG will award contracts to furniture manufacturers in accordance with the evaluation procedures established in the Final RFP. As discussed in the draft RFP (FA8057-12-R-0001) the Air Force is pursuing a two tier contracting strategy. Tier I contracts will establish not-to-exceed pricing for typical systems and modular configurations and related services to be later procured at Tier II. In addition Tier I contracts will standardize service requirements and identify the manufacturer-authorized small business dealer network for the program. Manufacturers and dealers will sign and return agreements as part of the Tier I proposal to confirm commitment to the terms and conditions of Tier I contracts. Note that Tier I contracts will consist of data reporting and program management reviews only - furnishings and related services will be purchased at the Tier II level. Tier II contract actions will be issued by the local Air Force Base contracting offices and will be competed among the small business dealers representing the Tier I manufacturers for that base. This strategy allows for maximum small business participation in the program from a fiscal and geographical perspective.</p>

However, Networx is the program that provides wide area networking to the Federal government. &nbsp;FedRelay must be able to serve Networx users. <br />Q. &nbsp;What carrier does the provider route traffic to?&nbsp;

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Network Contracting Office (NCO) 5, will solicit proposals under Solicitation No. VA245-12-R-0019 for the following:
Rural Case Management Outreach for Homeless Veterans and those at risk of Homelessness
Background Information
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a goal of ending homelessness among Veterans by 2015.  This goal is supported through the placement of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) homelessness services in rural areas, where there is identified community support for this population.  Rural or out-of-state homeless Veterans have difficulty or refuse to lease their state to seek services from VA Medical Center (VAMC) Homeless Programs.  Returning Veterans and Veterans struggling due to the economy may not have the knowledge or resources to prevent homelessness.  A VA homelessness program based in rural communities is needed to outreach, engage, case manage, refer, and educate homeless Veterans and Veterans at-risk of becoming homeless.  Homelessness services are needed in rural areas, where it is difficult for homeless Veterans to travel to medical centers for assessment.  Challenges with rural transportation and assessment time may leave Veterans stranded overnight away from services in their communities.  This overnight absence may also impact current housing in a community shelter or create other social support issues, which in turn may create additional barriers to ending homelessness.
Scope and Task Summary
This 12-month contract proposes to continue the establishment of a homelessness services program for rural communities in Pocomoke City, MD; Cambridge, MD; Charlotte Hall, MD; and Stephens City, VA by providing homelessness  evaluation and coordination with Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in these areas. Four Licensed Masters of Social Work (MSWs) and/or Licensed Mental Health Counselors (LMHCs) will act as contracted case managers, working out of the CBOCs or appropriate location within the rural community to enhance Veteran participation and to conduct immediate consultations.  When Veterans seek assistance or are referred, the case manager and CBOC staff will begin the process of enrollment and coordinate primary care and mental health assessment, as appropriate.  Furthermore, the case manager will work with the Veterans to coordinate appropriate VA services and referrals.
In addition to providing case management and identification and referral to needed resources, the case managers will also foster partnerships and collaboration among local health and mental health agencies and resources, establish standard operating procedures for working with the target population, develop service agreements with community resources, and advertise Veteran homelessness prevention services.
Additional Information
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this procurement are 621330, Offices of Mental Health Practitioners, size standard $7.0 million, and 624310, Vocational Rehabilitation Services, size standard $7.0 million.

<DESC><p>The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) welcomes the Mentor Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program. The Department of Defense (DoD) Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Program assists small businesses (prot&eacute;g&eacute;s) successfully compete for prime contract and subcontract awards by partnering with large companies (mentors) under individual, project-based agreements. Through this effort DoD provides incentives to major contractors to assist prot&eacute;g&eacute; firms and increase their overall participation as prime contractors and/or subcontractors. Mentors accomplish this by providing technical and development assistance to the prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Approved mentor firms will enter into mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements with eligible prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. A complete description of the DoD program and eligibility requirements is provided in Appendix I of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS). Policy and procedures for the program, the list of potential DIA mentors and a copy of DFARS Appendix I can be found at the DIA-Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) website at http://www.dia.mil/contracting/small-business/guide_mentor.html.</p>
<p>The DIA OSBP is seeking the benefits from this business relationship. Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements should be creative, unique, and capable of providing the necessary tools for a small business to support DoD and DIA's mission. The Agency is looking for industry support in the areas such as science and technology; software development; systems engineering; analytical services; and performance and program Management. Successful mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreements provide a winning relationship for the prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the mentor, and the DoD.</p>
<p>The Phase I of the Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; process, executive summary for Fiscal Year 2012 is due by the end of 3rd quarter FY 12 or NLT June 30, 2012. The POC of the DIA Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; program is Ms. Sherry Baldwin, sherry.baldwin@dodiis.mil, 202-231-2166.</p>
<p>This announcement is being amended to include a copy of the policy/regulation and procedures for participation in the DoD/DIA Mentor-Prot&eacute;g&eacute; program. Please read the documents thoroughly to ensure you are eligible to participate in the program and understand the requirements. The relationship between a Mentor and Prot&eacute;g&eacute; must be established prior to participation in the program. It is not the responsibility of DoD or DIA to find a Prot&eacute;g&eacute; a Mentor or a Mentor a Prot&eacute;g&eacute;.</p>

<AWDAMT>Not to Exceed $9,000,000
<AWDDATE>041912
<AWARDEE>Information Technology Coalition, Inc.
<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to notify the public that Request for Proposal (RFP) No. SB1341-12-RP-0005 has been awarded. Contract No. SB1341-12-CQ-0008 has been awarded to Information Technology Coalition, Inc. (IT Coalition) in accordance with the evaluation factors for award stated in section M of RFP No. SB1341-12-RP-0005.<br /><br />This contract is an Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a maximum cumulative amount of all task orders of $9,000,000.00.  The period of performance is for a base period of one year, and four option periods of one year each.  The awardee, IT Coalition Inc. is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business under the small business size standard of $25 million associated with NAICS code 541519.
<p>The first task order under this IDIQ contract was awarded to IT Coalition Inc. as a labor hour type task order for a total ceiling price of $905,490.00. The Performance Work Statement for this task order was included as part of the RFP SB1341-12-RP-0005, and the proposals were evaluated in accordance with Section M of RFP No. SB1341-12-RP-0005.</p>
<p>The first task order was competed and awarded as a labor hour type task order because it is not possible at the time of placing the order to accurately estimate the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of certainty.  Changes to certain elements of the requirement and priority occur in every Assessment &amp; Authorization (A&amp;A) project - particularly in large, complex systems where significant changes occur often that need to be assessed quickly, often prior to deployment of the system.  Stakeholders change, government regulations and policies change, organizations change - and security assessment projects must change with them and adapt as quickly as possible or insecure technology implementations may put NIST at risk. <br /> <br />As NIST has recently transitioned its A&amp;A Program to comply with the new Federal Risk Management Framework (RMF), labor hour contracts/orders will be even more essential since the RMF emphasizes the need for more real-time assessments to meet the rapid nature of IT implementation and service advances.  This new RMF process requires the continued flexibility of a labor hour type contract.  Specifically, decisions have yet to be made by stakeholders and subject matter experts as to which technology (or combination of technologies) will be implemented, and therefore the security assessment team must rapidly identify resources to adequately assess the security of those new technologies once decisions are made.  Decisions on how those technologies should be assessed, as well as the time it takes to perform the appropriate assessments have different associated costs in the required skill levels and availability of necessary resources.  Many of these decisions cannot be made until the project is already underway and technologies are able to be evaluated and tested by the project team.  Having the ability to quickly reprioritize and assess new technologies and changes to existing technologies and incorporate them into the existing contract/order structure without the need for costly delays to repeatedly modify the contract/order are essential to the continued success of NIST's new RMF process.</p>

<p>2. 96 FSS requires a one month extension to the Eglin CDC modular lease as final completion of the permanent CDC will not be completed. This modification to the leasing agreement will enable a transition of 265+ children to a completed facility without any lapse in childcare services. The cost of the extension will be $100,000 and extend it to 10 Feb 12<br />3. The modular CDC has been in operation since June 2006 under the current contractor. An extension of this contract will ensure an uninterrupted provision of services to its users. The nature of the business, providing child care, is one which requires specific square footage and building requirements to meet safety, health, and educational guidelines set by Department of Defense and National Association of Education for Young Children. During the time of the current contract, the Warrior Group has addressed all issues regarding safety, fire, and building discrepancies noted through daily, weekly, and monthly inspections performed by CDC staff, other base agencies, and Air Force level inspectors. The contract was initiated on September 9, 2005. Upon the onset of this contract, the need for the facility was determined to be no longer than 5 years; however, with the unexpected delay in construction of the MILCON and BRAC CDCs which now have an estimated completion date 10 Feb 12, it is imperative that the lease be extended. Remaining in the modular facility until the new permanent facility is complete will ensure a smooth and seamless transition from one facility to another while continuously complying with all guidelines and regulations governing the child development program which provides a "home away from home" for 265+ children. The need to factor in transition time from the modular facility to the permanent facility will extend the use of the modular facility until the end, as long as the construction process meets the expected construction time line. <br />3. Market research and inquires to other modular facility providers was conducted although, the cost benefits of utilizing the existing structure exceed the replacement of facility to fulfill the requirement.</p>

Justification and Approval
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	 Contracting Activity:  

Requesting Office:				Contracting Activity:
Department of Veterans Affairs		Department of Veterans Affairs
Grand Junction VA Medical Center		Veterans Health Administration
2121 North Avenue				SAO West, NCO 19			
Grand Junction, CO 81501	 		Rocky Mountain Acquisition Center
						4100 E. Mississippi Ave, Suite 900
						Glendale, CO 80246

VISN:	19

The agency responsible for this acquisition is: The Department of Veterans Affairs, SAO West, Network Contracting Office (NCO), Glendale, Colorado.  The Contracting Officer for this procurement is Alan Quille.  The Department of Veteran Affairs proposes to enter into a contract on the basis of other than full and open competition for one (1) Toshiba America Medical Systems G8000 uninterruptible power supply (UPS).  Purchase Request Number 575-12-1-4539-0001.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  

The proposed action is for a Firm Fixed Price procurement of a Toshiba America Medical Systems G8000 100KVA UPS for the Grand Junction VA Medical Center. This is a new contract that is a one-time purchase of the equipment. Estimated value: $64,525.00.


3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: 

The UPS provides back-up power to the CT scanner if normal commercial power is lost. The back-up power allows time for the safe removal of the patient from the CT scanner and storage of the image data. The proposed UPS is the only one tested and certified by Toshiba America Medical Systems for use with the Acquilion 16 CT Scanner. The UPS operates in the following modes:

Normal 
Converts AC input power to DC power for the inverter and for charging the batteries. The UPS supplies clean and stable AC power continuously to the critical load. The UPS Inverter output shall be synchronized with the bypass AC source when the bypass source is within the AC input voltage and frequency specifications. 
Loss of Main Power 
When Main Power is lost, the batteries shall automatically back up the inverter so there is no interruption of AC power to the critical load (CT scanner). 

Return of Main Power 
The system shall recover to the normal operating mode and shall cause no disturbance to the critical load while simultaneously recharging the backup battery. 

Transfer to Bypass AC source 
If the UPS becomes overloaded the UPS controls shall automatically transfer the critical load from the inverter output to the bypass AC source without interruption. When the overload condition is removed, after a preset "hold" period the UPS will automatically re-transfer the critical load from the bypass to the inverter output without interruption of power to the critical load. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

41 USC 253(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302.1  

	(X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(   )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(   )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(   )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(   )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(   )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(   )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

This particular unit is built, configured and certified by Toshiba America Medical Systems for use with the CT scanner. The version offered by Toshiba America Medical System has an output transformer of 200v versus the standard version with a 208v output transformer.  The Output Circuit Breakers are also specially configured to use with the CT Scanner. This configuration is only available through Toshiba America Medical Systems. The CT scanner is currently under a maintenance agreement with Toshiba America Medical Systems. Any damage caused by the installation or subsequently by the UPS would not be covered by the maintenance agreement. The additional cost of repair would be in addition to the current contract which is in excess of $125,000. If the CT scanner were to be damaged beyond repair the replacement cost would be in excess of $1,000,000.



6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable .  

Several vendors were contacted and only two responded with quotes. General Electric was also contacted as an alternative brand and there was no response. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

The anticipated total dollar amount of the proposed acquisition is $64,525.00.  Current market research found two additional sources of Toshiba America Medical Systems UPS's. However, neither one is properly configured for immediate use. The prices quoted were $52,645.00 (Model G9000) and $48, 795.00 (G8000). The quoted prices did not include installation or shipping. By signing the justification the Contracting Officer makes a determination that the costs/prices to the government are expected to be fair and reasonable.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

Market research was conducted and found two additional vendors that offer Toshiba America Medical Systems UPS's. The prices quoted were for standard configuration units and did not include installation or shipping. The prices quoted were $52,645.00 and $48,795.00.  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  

The Acquilion 16 CT scanner is a high valve unit of medical equipment that is currently under a maintenance contract with Toshiba America Medical Systems costing in excess of $125,000 per year. Utilizing units from other than Toshiba America Medical Systems could invalidate portions of the contract should the UPS cause any damage. This is a new procurement from Toshiba America Medical Systems, 2441 Michelle Dr., Tustin, CA, 92680 USA, 1-800-552-6291.  This unit will provide protection for both the patient and the equipment if main power should be lost.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  

Received quotes from the following vendors:

Powercom						Facility Gateway Corporation
1806 Cliff Drive, Suite H				4920 Triangle Street
Santa Barbara, CA 93109				McFarland, WI 53558

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any  Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or   Services Required:  

If the unit is replaced in the future, market research will again be conducted to find additional vendors so that a full and open competition could be conducted.

<AWDNBR>GS-07F-0385J
<DONBR>HSHQDFC-07-F-00139
<MODNBR>P00014
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD), proposes to extend task order GS-07F-0385J/HSHQDC-07-F-00139 for 6 months on a basis of other than full and open competition for Professional Security Support Services.
<p>Task Order GS-07F-0385J/HSHQDC-07-F-00139 was awarded to US Investigations Services (USIS) on July 16, 2007 with a 9 month base period and 4 option periods of 1 year each. The total award amount including options is $5,018,276.64.</p>
<p>The Professional Security Support Services provided consist of industrial security, physical/facilities security, information systems security and personnel security. The Contracting Officer has determined that issuing the proposed modification to extend task order GS-07F-0385J/HSHQDC-07-F-00139 to continue this effort represents the best value and will result in the lowest overall cost alternative, considering price and administrative costs, to meet the Government's needs.</p>
<p>This modification will be placed in accordance with FAR 8.404, "Use of Federal Supply Schedules." The General Services Administration (GSA) has already negotiated fair and reasonable pricing rates and the option price was evaluated prior to task order award. Additionally, prior to extending the task order, the ordering activity will consider the level of effort and the mix of labor proposed to perform the specific task being ordered in order to determine that the total price is reasonable. USIS was formally notified of the option to extend services in accordance with FAR 52.217-8.</p>
