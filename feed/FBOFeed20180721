The New York Harbor Healthcare System (NYHHS) St. Albans Community Living Center (SCLC) Textile Care Facility (TCF) located at 179-00 Linden Blvd Saint Albans New York 11433 is requesting procurement information for a commercial laundry project. The Network Contracting Office, (NCO) 2 is in search of SDVOSB/VOSB organizations that are capable of servicing the SCLC, NY. NCO2 need to procure the following commercial laundry services:
Scope of Work

This document contains the technical provisions for laundry services that are to be provided to NYHHS St. Albans Community Living Center (SCLC) Textile Care Facility (TCF).

The work required by this Performance Work Statement (PWS), consists of furnishing the physical laundry plant (at an off-site location), all labor, supervision, management, management support, supplies, ancillary equipment, vehicles and materials necessary for accomplishment of complete laundry services, as described herein this Performance Work Statement.

All workmanship shall be in accordance with practices established by the Association of Linen Management (ALM) www.almnet.org, Drycleaning & Laundry Institute (DLI) www.ifi.org (formally International Fabricare Institute), accepted industry standards and Veteran Affairs Laundry Publications.  It is intended that services shall include all processes necessary for the laundering of the articles even though every step involved is not specifically mentioned.  All work shall be performed under sanitary conditions as specified by The Joint Commission (TJC).  Physical separation, through the presence of a barrier wall and the use of pass-through equipment is required to maintain positive air pressure in the clean section relative to a negative air pressure in the soiled section.  In no case shall clean and soiled linen share the same physical space. * Plants in which the work is done shall be open to inspection of sanitary conditions by Government representatives.  After processing, laundered articles shall be in serviceable and sanitary condition, meeting established quality and performance requirement standards as shown in Quality Assurance Surveillance Assurance Plan (QASP). 
    
*The Laundry Plant layout/design should incorporate a  design for asepsis  where by clean linen does not come into contact with soiled linens nor share the same physical space, thus avoiding cross-contamination or reintroduction of bacteria once processed. 

Individual facility linen items shall remain separate through all processing cycles; soiled receipt, pre-sort, washing, drying, post-sort, processing and clean shipment. The use of tags will be used to record the processing in and out time of each Medical Center s laundry processing and maintain for time verification. A maximum of two empty washer pockets shall be placed in between each facility s linen to ensure linens are kept separate through the tunnel washer. Soiled linen with the same wash/dry formulas shall be combined to conserve water, chemicals, utilities and energy to ensure full utilization of and avoid damage to laundry equipment.

Any change of function by the Government, which may affect this contract as contemplated by this paragraph, and which requires permanent adjustments in frequency or type of performance, will be coordinated with the Contractor by the Contract Officer Representative (COR) and Contract Specialist/Contract Officer (CS/CO) prior to initiation of such a change to assure adequate contractual coverage.

The contractor shall provide pick-up and delivery services to transport clean and soiled textiles Monday through Friday between the hours of 8:00am and 4:30pm according to the established schedule, except for government holidays.

Contractor shall be responsible for delivering and exchanging prepackaged clean linen carts for preloaded soiled linen carts. Carts are 28  wide x 54  long x 63  in height and may vary in quantity and weights from delivery to delivery, particularly subsequent to the weekends and/or holidays. Contractor shall be required to use wheel chalks on the stationary set of wheels of each cart and suitable straps shall be used for each row of carts to secure each load.

Any items found to be unsatisfactorily cleaned shall be identified for the contractor by Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE)/COR in the laundry plant or by the facility linen distribution clerk at the contractor s facility.  Items identified by the government shall be returned on the next scheduled pickup after an unsatisfactory condition is discovered.  These items are to be kept separate from the normal laundry items and packaged for separate processing at the local facility pickup point.

The contractor shall re-wash items as needed or directed by the QAE/COR.  Responsibility for the cost of re-wash shall be borne by the party governing control over the cause for unsatisfactory cleaning.  Re-wash items shall be shown as a separate line item on the monthly invoice noting the cause for re-wash.  Poundage for re-wash caused by factors outside of the contractor s control shall be billed at the rate specified for soiled linen in the pricing schedule.

Emergency situations may require alteration of schedules.  Emergency situations will be defined by the QAE/COR.  In the event of medical facility emergencies, disaster, or drills, the contractor shall perform all services required by the emergency.  The contractor shall respond to the requirements in the Medical Center Disaster Plan placed upon the "Laundry" or Textile Care Section.

This contract is intended to produce a minimal acceptable level of performance.  The government does recognize the possibility of the contractor achieving the same or improved results due to innovative approaches and advances in the state-of-the-art of materials and supplies.  Any proposed changes to these specifications are contingent upon the recommendations of the QAE/COR and the approval of the CO in a written modification to the contract.

Contractor will provide laundry services/contingency services during any contractor shutdown by contracting with available laundry plants.  This charge will be agreed upon by COR and Contracting.  The charge/billing for services during alternate location of laundry services will continue to be billed on a cost per pound statement.

Linen that is prepared prior to linen requests will be labeled with the quantity, type and date the linen was washed.  At no time will linen remain in excess of 30 days in a linen cart for preparing par levels for linen orders.  If linen exceeds 30 days the linen will be rewashed prior to sending to the site at the expense of the contractor.  All new linen that is pre-washed will be maintained in the warehouse or the pack room and not in the laundry.  The one exception is in preparation to be pre-washed for use.   

Re-work will be completed within 72 business hours of linen identified as needed to be re-worked and sent to the sites within 96 business hours

<p>(End of Text)</p>
<p><br />CONTRACTOR UNCLASSIFIED ACCESS<br />Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (Jan 2017)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY</p>
<p>This text applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance. <br /><br />Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES</p>
<p>Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS</p>
<p>In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager.</p>
<p>Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or T5 or T5R equivalent investigation , which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC)/T3/T3R described below. Due to the privileged system access, an investigation suitable for High Risk national security positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-N; therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p><br />INTERIM ACCESS</p>
<p>The Command's Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS</p>
<p>The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p>The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES</p>
<p>Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Contractor employees under this contract are recognized as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] positions when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC or T3 or T3R equivalent investigation to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The investigation consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>&bull; SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product)<br />&bull; Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission)<br />&bull; Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. <br /><br />The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Command Security Manager. The Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); Potential suitability or security issues identified may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DoD Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

<p>BASE ACCESS<br />Base Access (NMCP)<br />Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC), has established the Navy Commercial Access Control System (NCACS), a standardized process for granting unescorted access privileges to vendors, contractors, suppliers and service providers not otherwise entitled to the issuance of a Common Access Card (CAC) who seek access to and can provide justification to enter Navy installations and facilities. Vendors visiting Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP) may obtain daily passes directly from Naval Station Norfolk (NSN) Pass and ID office, located at NSN (Bldg CD-9), 9040 Hampton Blvd, Norfolk, Virginia, 23505, by submitting identification credentials for verification and undergoing a criminal screening/ background check. Alternatively, if the vendor so chooses, it may voluntarily elect to obtain long-term credentials through enrollment, registration, background vetting, screening, issuance of credentials, and electronic validation of credentials at its own cost through one of the designated independent contractor NCACS service providers. Credentials will be issued every five years and access privileges will be reviewed / renewed on an annual basis. The costs incurred to obtain Navy installation access of any kind are not reimbursable, and the price(s) paid for obtaining long-term NCACS credentials will not be approved as a direct cost of this contract. Further information regarding NCACS can be found at http://cnic.navy.mil/CNIC_HQ_Site/index.htm.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This requirement is being issued in conjunction with FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items. The solicitation number is 1194299. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-99-1 dated July 16, 2018.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 518210- Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services; $32.5 Small Business Size standard in millions of dollars. This RFQ is issued as a full and open competition.</p>
<p><strong>Statement of Work</strong><br />The FDA/NCTR/Division of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (DBB) requires use of the large electronic medical record (EMR) system to conduct research to assess the safety and surveillance of FDA regulated products through the FDA adverse event reporting systems, with the pilot study working on the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) (CDER) database. A novel data mining and data visualization method will be developed and evaluated by using a large electronic medical record (EMR) system, such as VA databases, for drug induced cardiovascular abnormalities (i.e high blood pressure, stroke, QT prolongation, and arrhythmia) after drug exposure. The specific aims of this study (project E0762001) are as follows:<br /><br />&bull; A Bayesian approach known as topic modeling will be employed to identify the hidden adverse events for products and characterize the significant safety signals in the FAERS, Vigibase and the VA EHR databases.<br />&bull; Broaden and enrich medical lexicons in MedDRA ontology.<br />&bull; Apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm on CDER FAERS database to identify the relationships between multi-drugs and multi-adverse events, therefore, providing the availability for data mining to study relationships between drugs and adverse events. Due to patient privacy acts and strict restriction on permission to access the VA database and the specific skills needed to retrieve and process data from the VA record system, the required data can only be acquired by personnel having the authority to access the database.</p>
<p>The VA Cardio-related database (using drug-induced cardiovascular disease as a starting point) will be developed and used for this contract. The database will be developed using the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) database of the VA National EMR system, including drugs, adverse events, lab data, ECG, dose and drug co-exposure information, etc. The database requires drug dictionary, laboratory dictionary, ICD-9 dictionary, patients receiving any of the study drugs, patients with cardio events, exclude other cases of acute cardiovascular disease, medication-matched control population database, study population table and cardio event tables, patient demographic table, comedications taken at time-of cardio events, database of comorbidities at cardio events and model implementation. Due to the strict restriction on the permission to access the VA database and specific skill to retrieve and process the data, contractors shall have authority to access the VA database. The FDA has no access or provide access to the VA National EMR system.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>The database shall be developed to include the following:</p>
<p>1. Identify patients who developed cardiovascular abnormalities (such as high blood pressure, stroke, QT prolongation, arrhythmia, etc.) after drug exposure. Drugs that induce severe cardiovascular abnormal events will be identified in the system as "study drugs".</p>
<p>2. Create a drug dictionary populating all study drugs available at VA sites. The drug dictionary shall use a unique drug identifier (drug ID) to organize all study drugs that have been prescribed at the VA between 2000 and 2015.</p>
<p>3 Select a medication-matched control population. Medication-matched control subjects will be identified as subjects who received the same agent for a similar duration but did not develop acute cardiovascular abnormalities.</p>
<p>4 Create a Study population table and a cardio-event table. Combine the above cases and controls to create a study population table. The study population needs to be linked to vital information, laboratory data and an International Classification (ICD-9) code table.</p>
<p>5 Create a Demographic table. Retrieve demographic information for the study population and create a demographic table. Age, gender and ethnicity information will be collected.</p>
<p>6 Create a Table depicting comedications taken at the time of cardio-abnormalities.</p>
<p>7 Create a Table identifying comorbidities at cardiovascular abnormalities. <br /><br />8 Provide aggregated data in the form of PDF, MS Word, MS Excel files, or text files as applicable</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products. <br />Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin<br />___________________	___________________<br />___________________	___________________<br />(2) Certification.

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.</p>
<p>1352.209-73 COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APR 2010)</p>
<p>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />1352.209-74 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:<br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and<br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.<br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver. <br />52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal (BR)<br />1352.239-70 Software license addendum.<br />(a) This Addendum incorporates certain terms and conditions relating to Federal procurement actions.

Section 504.<br />(d) No Indemnification: The Federal government will not be liable for any claim for indemnification; such payments may violate the Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. Section 1341(a).<br />(e) Assignment: Payments may only be assigned in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. Section 3727, and FAR Subpart 32.8, "Assignment of Claims."<br />(f) Invoices: Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. Section 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-125, Prompt Payment.<br />(g) Patent and Copyright Infringement: Patent or copyright infringement suits brought against the United States as a party may only be defended by the U.S. Department of Justice (28 U.S.C.

Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:<br />1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.<br />2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting<br />3. Identify constraints in transparency<br />(b) The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.<br />(c) Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.<br />(d)There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:<br />1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&not;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates).<br />2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.<br />3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.<br />4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br />5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.<br />6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the S. Government.<br />7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).<br />AA18-02 NOAA Requests for Equitable Adjustment<br />(a) The amount of any request for equitable adjustment to contract terms shall accurately reflect the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable. The request shall include only costs for performing the change. All indirect costs included in the request shall be properly allocable to the change in accordance with applicable acquisition regulations. <br />(b) Any request for equitable adjustment to contract terms that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold shall bear, at the time of submission, the following certificate executed by an individual authorized to certify the request on behalf of the Contractor: <br />I certify that the request is made in good faith, and that the supporting data are <br />accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
