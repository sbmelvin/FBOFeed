<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Agfa Corporation.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of McGuire Air Force Base.  This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Soliciting from a single source.  Description:  The Government has a requirement for three (3) Barco Coronis 5 Mega Pixel (5MP) LCD gray scale monitors as an upgrade to the current Barco Coronis CRT monitors being used for radiological screening and testing.  The sole source determination is based on the fact that the monitors must be purchased from Agfa Corporation to ensure system compatibility since the monitors are an upgrade to the current Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) system.  The monitors connect to a graphics card that is designed to work only with monitors provided by Agfa, so an upgrade to the system monitors must be purchased from Agfa to ensure system compatibility. Additionally, the warranty and service maintenance agreements already in place will only continue if the monitors are purchased from and installed by Agfa.    No solicitation package will be issued.  This is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by February 16, 2007, no later than 10:00am, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)is soliciting research proposals in the area of survivability of microwave receiver front-ends from high energy threats.  The objective is to create a microwave receiver front-end which can withstand high energy exposure without compromising receiver sensitivity, bandwidth, or dynamic range.  

The objective of the Electromagnetic Pulse Tolerant Microwave Receiver Front-End program is to develop a novel robust and sensitive microwave receiver front-end capable of surviving high energy electromagnetic attacks.  The robust RF front-end technology developed should be scalable to operate within the 0.5-18 GHz frequency band over as large a fractional bandwidth as feasible while maintaining high sensitivity.  The program will culminate in a full system performance demonstration leading to military system transition opportunities.  

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following area:  

Modeling, Design, Fabrication and Testing: Design of the robust and sensitive microwave receiver front-end should be supported by realistic modeling of the effects of high energy attacks.  The model should incorporate experimentally derived parameters and should help in understanding the durability of the proposed device concept.  The Electromagnetic Pulse Tolerant Microwave Receiver Front-End program will require innovative approaches to realize a microwave receiver front-end which can withstand high energy exposure without compromising receiver sensitivity, bandwidth, or dynamic range.  Particularly encouraged are novel ideas to suppress or eliminate arcing, thermal, and electromigration induced damage that accompany a high energy attack.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 07-19 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.


PROGRAM SCOPE

The Electromagnetic Pulse Tolerant Microwave Receiver Front-End program will be conducted in three phases, each having definite and measurable milestones, the most critical of which will be referred to as Go/No-Go (GNG) metrics, listed in the table below.  The final phase will consist of a full system demonstration.  That is, an entire RF front-end receiver system satisfying all Phase II GNG performance metrics will be demonstrated.  Additional component-level development will also continue in the final phase to strive towards the Phase III (end-of-program) stretch goals.

TEAMING ARRANGEMENTS

Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site - http://www.davincinetbook.com/teams/ has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA.  Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Steve Pappert, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: BAA07-19@darpa.mil.

PROPOSER'S QUESTIONS 
A "Proposer's Questions" website will be posted for BAA 07-19 on the DARPA, Microsystems Technology Office solicitations page (www.darpa.mil/baa/#eto). If you would like to have a question answered and posted on this site, please send your question to the following address: BAA07-19@darpa.mil.

Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  

Proposers must submit a full proposal to https://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa, or via grants.gov for Universities wishing to use the "Apply" function, on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Friday, April 13 , 2007 in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps and Grants.gov. Full proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds. This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 07-19, Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA. No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received and to award without discussions. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA. Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only". Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), and Small and Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for these organizations' participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in microwave technology.

<DESC>RFQ CLOSES MAR 12. SITE VISIT VERY STRONGLY ADVISED MAR 1, 100-1200HRS, CASTLE AFB, ATWATER, CA. CONTACT CO FOR SITE VISIT RESERVATION. OBTAIN RFQ FROM CO BY EMAIL joyce.stevenson@afrpa.pentagon.af.mil STATEMENT OF WORK - FOR FUEL LINE CLEANUP AT CASTLE CA 95652 BACKGROUND:  During routine Base Realignment and Closure activities, the Castle Local Reuse Authority (LRA) had a work crew near Building (B) 1336 at the former Castle Air Force Base, CA, installing an above ground storage tank.  As they were in the process of cutting off some protruding stubs of piping from the former jet fuel system they discovered fuel remaining in one of the lines.  They stopped work for safety purposes.  The three pipeline stubs were associated with a test stand (known as the Hydrant Hose Truck Checkout Station (HHTR) on drawings) and pumping station near the former B1336 Underground Storage Tank (UST) that was removed in 2005.  Two of the stubs appear to tee underground into a single 6-inch steel line (HHTR line), which runs underground to the B1336 fuel pump shed.  This line also appears to tee prior to entering the pump shed so that there are two flanged pipe ends for the line at the shed.  The two aboveground stubs for the HHTR line are 8-inch and 6-inch steel, respectively. Total length of the HHTR line is approximately 185 feet. The third stub leads to a 6-inch steel line (RF line on the drawings) in the same trench that goes back to the pump shed.  This line also appears to tee into the 12-inch refueling line to the Tanker Apron and is assumed to have been pigged and nitrogen-filled at the time of Base closure. There are three 1 ?-inch steel drain lines, one associated with each of the pipeline stubs that originally ran to the product recovery tank. This tank was removed in 2005 and the lines in the excavation may or may not have been capped; however, all three product recovery lines are open to atmosphere and are assumed not to contain fuel products. All of these lines have not been used since the base was closed in 1995 (See pictures - Exhibit 1). 2.SCOPE OF SERVICES:2.1 Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, engineering, supervision, training and other items and services as necessary to perform the following clean up. 2.2 Contractor shall take composite sample(s) of contents of all visible pipeline stubs and analyze contents to identify the waste for manifesting and disposal.  Contractor shall deliver written sample analyses to the Air Force Real Property Agency (AFRPA) before proceeding with work. 2.3  Based on the results of the sample analyses, the Contractor shall remove, transport, and dispose of any flammable or non-inert liquid, such as jet fuel/water mixture (specific admixture unknown) from the 6-inch steel pipeline at the HHTR (HHTR line), or any other line containing inert and non-inert liquid.  CAUTION: Non-sparking tools and equipment must be used for this requirement. 2.4 Contractor shall investigate the 6-inch pipeline located in the center of the three aboveground stubs by removing the flanged cover at the elbow.  If a nitrogen atmosphere is present, line shall be assumed to have been cleaned and inerted by the Air Force at Base closure and no further cleaning or grouting action is required.  If no nitrogen is present or if fuel is present, contractor shall contact the AFRPA Contractor Representative before proceeding with work. 
2.5 Contractor shall perform a pressure test of the 6-inch HHTR pipeline.  The pressure test shall be performed in accordance with the California Code of Regulations, Title 23, Chapter 16, Section 2636(f)(4).  Contractor shall deliver pressure test results in a written format to the AFRPA Contracting Officers Representative. 2.6 If the pipeline fails the pressure test (i.e., leak rate greater than 0.1 gallons per hour), Contractor shall contact the AFRPA Contracting Officer and Contracting Officers Representative for further direction. 2.7 If the pipeline passes the pressure test, Contractor shall fill the pipeline with Portland cement grout or Portland cement/sand slurry mixture.  Based upon the Air Force?s HHTR construction drawing (See Exhibit 2) and contractor?s investigation, Contractor shall estimate the quantity of grout required to fill the pipeline.  The grout shall be applied in one continuous operation until the pipeline is filled.  Contractor shall report their estimated quantity and actual quantity of grout applied to pipeline in writing to the AFRPA Contractor Representative.  (Caution: The pipe needs to be grouted prior to cutting to avoid an explosion hazard). 2.8 After grouting, Contractor shall cut off the discharge end of all three pipelines and the three 1 ?-inch drain lines associated with them flush with existing concrete pad.

<DESC>The GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural/engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals.  All projects will be LEED-EB certified.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project involves the modernization of the HVAC systems and the installation of a sprinkler system throughout the Minton-Capehart Federal Building.  Architect/Engineering (A/E) design services and preparation of design documents are required for this renovation project.  Built in 1974, the Minton-Capehart Federal Building is located at 575 North Pennsylvania Street in Indianapolis, Indiana.  The Minton-Capehart building is a Modernist six story building with a ground floor below grade, a mechanical mezzanine above grade, and a penthouse above the core area of the sixth floor.  Attached to the building is a two-level parking facility.  The prime objectives of this project include, but are not limited to:  1) upgrading the HVAC systems to improve indoor air quality throughout the building; 2) reducing energy consumption using more efficient equipment and controls; 3) improving the safety of the building occupants and reducing the loss of property in the event of a fire.  It is anticipated the project delivery method will include the procurement of a Construction Manager (constructor) (CMc) in order to review both the constructability and cost of the project as the design is developed.  The project will be phased and the building will be occupied during construction.
SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural, engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for verification of existing systems and conditions, concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), document preparation to be used in providing clear direction to the CM team, as well as possible post-construction contract services (PCCS) that may include shop drawing review and approval, construction inspection, and other required supplemental services if so requested by the Government.
For the Minton-Capehart Federal Office Building, the scope of design work as it relates to the planned modernization and renovation would include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: (1) survey of existing conditions; (2) detailed scope verification; (3) energy conservation analysis; (4) complete architectural and engineering design; (5) preparation of specifications and CADD drawings for construction documents; (6) value engineering; (7) costs analysis; (8) post-construction contract services (PCCS); (8) record drawings and construction phase A/E inspection services.  
Throughout the design process, the selected lead designer and A/E will assist the Government in identifying those elements of work that can be accomplished within the Congressionally-mandated cost limitation for the project.  The scope of Construction work to be covered in the design, as it relates to the planned modernization and renovation will include, but not be limited to, the following:  (1)  refurbish the air-handling units for greater airflow to provide the recommended minimum amount of fresh air for each occupant and improve the total air circulation; (2)  replace the fiberglass branch distribution ductwork and diffusers to handle greater airflows and eliminate contamination from glass fiber in the environmental air, (3)  replace the stair pressurization fans with larger fans that will produce the necessary pressures and airflows; (4)  provide a new direct digital control (DDC) temperature control system for energy efficiency; (5)  provide additional commissioning of the system and other improvements for LEED-EB certification; (6)  utilize the existing dry standpipe risers in the stairs as a part of a new sprinkler system; (7)  provide sprinkler protection extending from the mains to each space in the building; (8)  provide a new fire pump and jockey pump, installed in the ground floor mechanical room, to boost the pressure for the new sprinkler system; (9)  provide new lay-in ceilings, repair hard ceilings, and replace lighting throughout the building with modular wiring and automatic controls for lower maintenance costs, easier adds and moves, and greater energy efficiency.  
GSA is in the process of evaluating federal buildings of the 1950s through the 1970s.  The lead designer and A/E shall identify, assess, and preserve character-defining features and attributes of the original design.  Design changes are to be well-integrated and compatible with the original design so that the building retains its architectural character.  A lead designer and A/E shall work with GSA’s regional historic preservation staff to determine potential effects to these features and attributes due to proposed alterations.  The project will meet GSA design standards for secure facilities, conform to the P100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), include LEED-EB certification; and respond to customer agency requirements.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor?s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity proposes to make an award to Gartner, Inc., 56 Top Gallant Rd., Stamford, CT 06902, on a sole source basis, for a membership to the EXP Premier subscription. This membership includes researh reports, Talking Technology Audio Program, Gartner Symposia, regional roundtables, spotlights that reflect current issues and consider these issues from different perspectives and tie together research from all the Core Research Deliverables, special reports, resea rch notes, perspectives/research briefs, executive summaries and access to Standard Analyst Inquiry as required for business purposes. The authority cited is FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Req uirements. The reason this authority is cited is that no other source, other than Gartner, Inc., provides an integrated offering of peer networking and research programs. It is a unique program that enables client organizations to address their strategic a nd tactical issues more effectively, extend limited staff resources, and solve difficult problems more easily. To ensure that the appropriate CIO peer networking program is selected, a number of prerequisites must be met. First, any company offering CIO pe er networking and research must be able to augment the core dedicated research team with a sufficient number of qualified supporting individuals averaging at least 15 years industry experience to follow the information technology function's subtleties and intricacies in a manner necessary to provide a broad enough perspective for best advice and insight. The provider must have a well-established and recognized research network with a global presence in at least 50 countries. The provider must have a detaile d, finely-tuned, and proven research process and methodology. The provider must have a high level overview of industry accepted ratings for companies, trends, and technology. They must have accepted industry tracking of emerging technologies, including obj ective research, advisory and consulting with specific IT vertical dedicated to the federal government marketplace.

<DESC>NSL AK-07-02 - "MANAGEMENT AND LOGISTICS OF OCEANOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT - LAUNCH 1273" The Government's intent is to make an award as a 100% small business set-aside.  Please note that this requirement is subject to availability of funds.  The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to identify potential small businesses that are interested and capable of performing the work described herein.  MMS will not accept Unsolicited Proposals related to the subject of this announcement.  MMS does not intend to pay for the preparation of any information submitted in response to this announcement.  Please be advised that this announcement may constitute the only notice for this acquisition.  All interested parties must be able to qualify under the North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 488390,  "Other support services for water transportation" The Small Business Associations' size standard for this NAICS Code is $5 million BACKGROUND - The 1953 Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act and its subsequent amendments require the Secretary of the Interior to monitor and assess the impacts of resource development activities in Federal waters on all relevant human, marine, and coastal environments.  The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 further requires that scientific research be used to inform major environmental policy decisions.  The MMS is the Federal administrative agency created both to conduct OCS lease sales and to monitor and mitigate impacts that might be associated with resource development.  Within MMS, the Environmental Studies Program implements and manages the responsibilities of environmental research and monitoring.  Launch 1273 is the MMS marine vessel currently used to support the ongoing collection of scientific data from the near-shore environment of the Beaufort Sea.  PURPOSE - The U. S. Minerals Management Service (MMS) has a requirement to provide for logistical management and maintenance of the MMS marine vessel Launch 1273 for a period of three years (spring 2007-autumn 2009) in support of ongoing MMS research efforts in the near-shore water of coastal Alaska.   This contract will provide for year-round logistical management and maintenance of Launch 1273 to support safe and uninterrupted environmental research of offshore oil and gas exploration and development operations. Launch 1273 and its management contractor must be responsive and flexible to accommodate the shifting schedules and priorities of the MMS Alaska OCS research contractors during summer operations.The primary region of operation will be the Arctic Ocean (Beaufort and Chukchi Seas), although circumstances could potentially also necessitate some operations in the Bristol Bay region of the Bering Sea.  Initially, the MMS will  transfer and receive physical possession of Launch 1273 at Prudhoe, Alaska, where the vessel is currently stored. The Contractor will be responsible for providing a licensed Captain, who is acceptable to MMS, any necessary crew, routine maintenance and repair, fueling and mobilization (with assembly and transport) and demobilization (with cleaning, transport, and disassembly) between ocean-side docking facilities and winter storage facilities at Prudhoe Bay.  The MMS will be responsible for general scheduling of the Captain's duties during each field season based upon the most current environmental study information priorities. The contract will involve administrative coordination and planning with the MMS Alaska OCS regional office in Anchorage, and will also involve execution of a variety of routine tasks from April through September of each year, including: mechanical repairs in the spring, transfer and deployment of electronic and safety gear associated with vessel operations at sea, arranging for mobilization out of storage and into the ocean at the onset of the summer open water season, arranging for supplies of diesel fuel and water, arranging for emergency  back-up support during summer operations, and arranging for de-mobilization out of the ocean and back into storage at the end of summer.  The contract will be responsible for maintaining a safe and serviceable marine vessel to support, without interruption or distraction, the variable scientific research and monitoring efforts of the Federal Government in the Arctic Ocean during the summer open water season. MMS Launch 1273 is a 36-foot marine vessel designed roughly on the specifications of a Bristol Bay Gill-Netter.  With an aluminum hull, 300 hp diesel engine, and oceanographic winch, the 13-ton Launch provides a mobile, cost-effective, and specialized research vessel for a variety of biological and oceanographic studies throughout the coastal waters of Alaska.  The vessel is excellently suited for support of certain projects in near-shore waters, such as the recently completed multi-disciplinary ANIMIDA study in the Beaufort Sea, and earlier work in Cook Inlet and elsewhere.  Technical specifications for Launch 1273 will be provided in Section J of the RFP. This requirement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 19, Small Business Programs.   Interested parties must email their request for a copy of the Request for Proposal (RFP) to Rhonda Fernandez, Contract Specialist at Rhonda.Fernandez@mms.gov by 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, February 16, 2007.  All inquiries must include the solicitation number (M07PS13151), your full name, organization name, address, e-mail address, and phone and fax numbers.

This purchase is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  These items are in support of the MVCS (Multiple Vehicle Communication System) Program. In order to reduce the cost of using tactical radios the program wishes to simulate the radios with a network simulator.  These items have been used in current developmental models leading developers to document setup procedures, and test plans.  Altering these items would affect any current development, which would adversely affect ship delivery.  By using the same components that have already been used and tested this will mitigate the r!  isks of integration of other units in which this development tool will be used. NAICS 541511. FSC 5999

<DESC>NASA/Glenn Research Center has a requirement for 13.8 Kg of Sylramic™ Fiber. This fiber will be used to produce Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) material for the Hypersonic Aeronautics program.  Advanced engine concepts require a new class of materials for use as combustor liners, in order to meet pollution and efficiency requirements.   Testing will be conducted to assess the mechanical and time dependent behavior of candidate Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) materials systems at combustor liner and turbine vane operating stresses and temperatures. The successful material must display thermal stability and mechanical durability at simulated engine conditions. An exhaustive fiber identification and selection program, conducted under the material development program of the Enabling Propulsion Materials program (EPM) and the Ultra Efficient Engine Technology program (UEET), identified Sylramic™ fiber as the only fiber to meet temperature and durability requirements.  NASA/Glenn Research Center intends to purchase the item from ATK Space Systems Inc. Magna, Utah as Sylramic™ fiber is produced by a proprietary process and sold under exclusive license by ATK Space Systems. The UEET program has developed a process which utilizes the specific internal chemistry of the Sylramic™ fiber to produce a coating which is vital to the long-term survival of components made from the composite. Competition for another fiber would require an extensive material characterization program beyond the time and scope of UEET. As a result, the Government would incur substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 23, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/KSC intends to use simplified acquisition procedures for a non-competitive procurement with the University of Central Florida, Office of Research & Commercialization.  NASA intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order under the authority provided in FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements to support NASA in research and development of a high-fidelity, 6 degrees of freedom interactive software simulation program. This research will complete the development begun in 2005 for a simulation model of a launch vehicle under nominal, transient, and off-nominal flight conditions that can be used in range safety analysis and planning.  The simulation would benefit the Range Safety projects in the Applied Technology Directorate at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and also the Exploration and Space Operations Mission Directorates.	The next generation of range safety systems may rely much more on space-based assets such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) and NASA’s Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS).  High-fidelity launch vehicle simulations are a vital and necessary tool in evaluating the operational capabilities of such systems during errant flight.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Donna.B.Stubbs@NASA.gov not later than 4:00 p.m. local time on February 20, 2007.

<DESC>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than HIV. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics that is funded through a variety of research grants and contracts. 

The Division also supports substantial preclinical research efforts to develop new therapeutics. It is anticipated that these efforts will produce many promising investigational products that will require initial testing in humans in Phase I clinical trials. In order to ensure the capacity to evaluate the growing pipeline of investigational products as they become available, it is critical for DMID to establish the dedicated resources necessary to undertake Phase 1 clinical trials for a broad range of infectious diseases. 

The NIAID therefore has a requirement to fulfill the need to provide and manage a Phase I Clinical Trial Unit for Therapeutics Against Infectious Diseases. This phase I unit will operate under Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and will provide and support electronic data capture system.

NIAID anticipates that a minimum of four protocols will be implemented in each year of the contract. Each protocol will include pharmacokinetic (pK) and pharmacodynamic (pD) and safety evaluation of investigational therapies. It is estimated that 150 healthy individuals (18 to 45 of age) will be recruited each year, and at least 45% of those will be from minority groups. The clinical protocols and all additional clinical documents needed, such as, Case Report Forms (CRFs), and Manuals of Procedures (MOPs), will be developed by the Contractor. The Contractor will also provide independent clinical site monitoring abilities, electronic data capturing ability and data management capacity. 

It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a seven-year period of performance beginning on or about March 4, 2008.  The total annual estimated effort anticipated is 17.5 FTE.

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Government.   This RFP will be available electronically on or about March 1, 2007, and may be accessed on FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.   No collect calls will be accepted.   No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command has cancelled solicitation H92222-06-R-0023 for the family of ballistic plates for the Body Armor Load Carriage System (BALCS).  A new solicitation is anticipated to be released in the February/March 2007 timeframe.  An open industry day is anticipated for the morning of March 1, 2007, with follow-on one-on-one contractor-government meetings anticipated for the afternoon of March 1 and as needed on March 2, 2007 in Natick, MA.  All those wishing to participate shall provide Company Name, Participant Names, Participant Driver?s License Number (for entry into facility) and their Security Clearance Level, by February 23, 2007, to Sheryl Harris, Program Manager SOF Survival Systems (PM-SSS), 508-233-4303.  Individuals cleared at the Secret level will have the opportunity to provide information at that classification during one-on-one meetings about the status of ongoing ballistic technologies that are manufacturable for the upcoming solicitation.  During this Industry day, potential offerors will have the opportunity to comment on the requirements of the solicitation, and provide perspective on the technologies they have available to meet the requirement.  The requirement will be for a five year indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract issuing firm fixed price (FFP) delivery orders to procure a family of ballistic plates for the BALCS to improve the survivability and mobility of Special Operation Forces (SOF).  The family of ballistic protective armor will maximize ballistic protection while minimizing the burdens of weight, bulk and heat stress.  This will be achieved with the use of three (3) different plate technologies available in different cuts.  The components will integrate with the existing BALCS Releasable Body Armor Vest system, the BALCS Soft Armor package (for the Baseline configuration), and other SOF systems providing the ability to increase or decrease ballistic protection and load.  Vendor?s systems will be checked for interoperability with current configurations.  The ballistic protective components will be selected on a performance basis in order to take advantage of most current technologies.  The three BALCS configurations include, 1) Baseline Configuration:  One cut of ballistic plate that can be used as a back or a front with an areal density not exceeding 6.5 pounds per square foot and thickness of the plates not exceeding .750 inches (this system uses a ballistic plate and soft armor package to meet performance requirements); 2) Tactical Stand Alone Ballistic Configuration:  Three cuts of ballistic plate with an areal density not exceeding 6.9 pounds per square foot and thickness of the plates not exceeding 1.0 inches (meets requirements with no soft armor package); and 3) Low Visibility Ballistic Configuration: Three cuts of ballistic plate with an areal density not exceeding 4.8 pounds per square foot and thickness of the plates not exceeding .50 inches (may or may not use Soft Package, depending on threat and performance of configuration submitted).  All plate technologies/configurations must have been previously ballistically tested (both conditioned and unconditioned).  Ballistic testing must have been performed in accordance with the general provisions of MIL-STD-662, NIJ 0101.04 and MIL-C-44050A test protocols for Level IV.  Conditioning shall include High and Low Temperatures, Gasoline, Motor Oil and Break Free as well as Sea (salt water), and Chlorine Water Immersion.  The minimum quantities will vary from 10 to 300 depending on the plate technology and design.  The maximum quantities will vary from 50,000 to 140,000 depending on the plate technology and design.  In addition, a Subcontracting Plan will be required of large businesses.  Any textile products must be Berry Amendment compliant.  The Government reserves the right to award multiple contracts.  The offeror will be required to provide Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) with proposal submission for evaluation.  PDMs shall consist of: Baseline Configuration, total 8 PDMs as follows: (SPEAR cut) - 2 small, 2 medium, 2 large, 2 x-large PDMs.  Tactical Stand Alone Ballistic Configuration (TSA), total 18 PDMs as follows: TSA (SPEAR cut) - 2 small, 2 medium, 2 large, 2 x-large PDMs; TSA (Swimmer cut) - 2 small, 2 medium, 2 large, 2 x-large PDMs; TSA (MSAP) ? 2 one size only PDMs.  Low Visibility Ballistic Configuration (LV), total 18 PDMs as follows: LV (SPEAR cut) - 2 small, 2 medium, 2 large, 2 x-large PDMs; LV (Swimmer cut) - 2 small, 2 medium, 2 large, 2 x-large PDMs; LV (MSAP) - 2 one size only PDMs.  The Government anticipates changes to the shape of the plate technologies throughout the life of the contract as required to meet emerging threats and the needs of SOF Operators.  Detailed patterns will not be provided for the solicitation by the government, however, general shape drawings will be provided so that all vendors have the ability to meet interoperability requirements equally.  This is not an R&D contract.  Any questions related to this effort shall be emailed to Verdetta Weaver at weaverv@socom.mil.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Institute on Drug Abuse to solicit, negotiate and award a continuation of a current Purchase Order with Susan David, Ph.D. for an additional 612 hours. The period of performance for the additional hours is anticipated to be 9 months. This order is being conducted under FAR 13.  Ms. David is currently performing the following services.  NIDA has several research networks, such as the Community Epidemiology Work Group, the Criminal Justice Drug Abuse Treatment Studies and the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) collecting data at sites throughout the country.  These networks operate independently from one another and the level of communication among them likely varies widely.  The purpose is to explore whether there is any value added to enhancing the communication among the networks.  It is possible that the data emerging from these networks can not only inform the activities of the other networks, but may also stimulate new research opportunities and collaborations among the established networks.  Further, research dissemination efforts could be enhanced through collaborations with the Addiction Technology Transfer Centers (ATTCs) supported by both SAMHSA and NIDA similar to the dissemination projects that have been developing between the CTN and ATTCs.  A recompetition of this requirement would cause significant delays in the ongoing data collection and analysis.  

The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.     This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.     Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis.     The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

<SUBJECT>M--Operation and Maintenance of the Yuma Desalting Plant, WQIC Research Facility, and Operation of the Analytical Laboratory Services
<SOLNBR>06SP340020
<ARCHDATE>02092008
<CONTACT>Virginia Toledo Contract Specialist 9283438136     ;
<DESC>The Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office (YAO), has a requirement for the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of Yuma Desalting Plant (YDP), O&M of the WQIC Research Facility (WQIC); and the Operation of the Analytical Laboratory (ALS) located at 7301Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, Arizona. The YDP is one of the world's largest reverse osmosis desalting plants.  Its full capacity is 72 million gallons per day.  Though the main plant is not currently operating, it is maintained in state of readiness that varies according to Government requirements.  The contractor will be required to provide all contract management, planning, supervision, administration, personnel, operation, engineering support, labor, chemicals, services and transportation necessary to perform all aspects of the contract requirement.  The government will provide the bulk of tools, equipment, supplies, materials, and facilities. The WQIC is a designated National Center for Water Treatment Technology, a nation-wide affiliation of publicly-funded water treatment research facilities that partner with the public for testing. The National Water Research Institute, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, and the U.S. Army sponsor the National Centers Program. The goal of the National Centers Program is to promote improved water-treatment processes through united research efforts by government, academia, and private industry. There are currently only seven National Centers in the U.S., and each center explores different water research focus areas.  The Analytical Laboratory supports the YDP, WQIC and other Government authorized operations of the YAO by performing chemical, biological, and physical tests; and preparing the data for engineering and data reporting. The mission of the WQIC is to advance the development and transfer of water purification technologies at its state-of-the-art facility through field tests, hands-on training, and implementation. The varying levels of research focus on the following research goals: (1) analytical laboratory services for YDP and the YAO; (2) to reduce the cost to operate and maintain the YDP; (3) securing safe, clean water supplies for the West now and in the future; and (4) transferring federally-developed technology to the public pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986.  The WQIC also provides a water supply for the YAO.   The government anticipates that a single award will be made (YDP, WQIC and ALS).  The selected contractor must exhibit extensive experience in reverse osmosis (RO) desalting, providing licensed analytical laboratory service, and in advanced water treatment experience including (1) Administration; (2) Operations; (3) Maintenance; and (4) Engineering support. The proposed requirement will contain a combination of firm fixed price (for the basic O&M requirement), cost reimbursement, Fixed Labor-Hour, and Time and Material CLINs for IDIQ components under which Task Orders may be issued.  The performance period will have a base year (1year) and four 1 year options.  The Government is responsible for determining the contractor's level of responsibility for each contract year.  The Government, at its option and with notice, may increase or decrease the level of responsibility to achieve a desired level of support in accordance with the SOW. This solicitation will be completed on a full and open competition basis.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 221310 (Water Supply and Irrigation Systems) and the related small business size standard is $6.5 Million.  The estimated price range of this project for the base year is between $3 and $5 Million.  The solicitation, in the form of a Request for Proposal (RFP) No. 06SP340020 will be available at the link provided in this notice or check our website http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  The solicitation will be available on or about February 9, 2007 with offers due forty five (45) days after issuance of the solicitation.  Offerors should visit the web site after February 9, 2007 in order to access the solicitation and any subsequent amendments and/or notices. Hard copies of this solicitation will not be available. The solicitation will be issued electronically via FedbizOpps web site and will be available electronically on a CD upon written request. A Site Visit is tentatively scheduled for February 22, 2007 at the Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office, 7301 Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, AZ  85364. Effective October 1, 1997, contractors are required to register their firms in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receiving a contract award.  This database provides basic business information, capabilities, and financial information to the Government and complies with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, which requires federal agencies to have the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of every contractor and to pay every contractor through electronic funds transfer.  Registration can be accomplished through the World Wide Web at http//www.ccr.gov.   Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  The CCR Handbook and information on the registration process can be obtained via the CCR website, http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.    Offerors will be required to complete the annual representation and certification electronically via the Online Representation and Certification Application (ORCA) website at http://orca.bnp.gov.   Questions may be submitted electronically to Ms. Virginia Toledo at vtoledo@lc.usbr.gov   Responses to this notice should be mailed to Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office, Attention: YAO-3100, 7301 Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, AZ 85364.*****

<CONTACT>Maxwell Kimpson, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-496-6546, Fax 301-402-0642, Email kimpsonm@mail.nlm.nih.gov
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) National Institutes of Health (NIH) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a) and U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization, Copenhagen Hospital Corporation, Copenhagen, Denmark, for a multi-year contract as defined by FAR Part 17 Multi-Year Contracts (specifically, FAR Part 17.104, Part 17.105, & Part 17.106) .  The contractor will provide NLM with at least twice-yearly updates to the English and Spanish versions of SNOMED CT, originally developed by the College of American Pathologists, and a license to incorporate SNOMED-CT updates into the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus (National Library of Medicine registered trademarks); to use SNOMED-CT within the UMLS Metathesaurus for research purposes within the NLM, in NLM's production data creation systems, and in its publicly accessible retrieval systems; and to redistribute SNOMED-CT, within the UMLS Metathesaurus or otherwise, free-of-charge to U.S. entities for use within the U.S. for any health care, public health, research, educational, or statistical purposes.  SNOMED-CT is a comprehensive, multi-axial, controlled terminology intended for use in patient, public health, and research data.  SNOMED CT has been recommended as U.S. standard by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, has been adopted as a U.S.-government wide standard by the interagency Consolidated Health Informatics Initiative, and is part of several U.S. Interoperability Specifications recently released by the Health Information Technology Standards Panel under contract to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, Department of Health and Human Services.  In June 2003, NLM entered into a 5-year contract with the College of American Pathologists to obtain updates to SNOMED CT under similar license terms.  The College of American Pathologists has announced its intention to transfer their intellectual property in SNOMED-CT to the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization in early 2007 (reference FAR 52.217-2 Cancellation with respect to contract cancellation).

Since SNOMED-CT will then become a proprietary product of the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization, NLM has determined that the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization is the only source capable of providing the software and the ongoing software updates. Responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.  Please refer to Numbered Note 22.
		
If you have any questions, please contact Maxwell Kimpson at (301) 496-6546 or by email at kimpsonm@mail.nlm.nih.gov.  Collect calls will not be accepted.

<DESC>This announcement is modified to correct formatting errors. This is not an announcement of a Solicitation, it is only a Request for Information (RFI), and a request for proposals may or may not result from it. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) needs to assess external capabilities to provide Landsat-like satellite data on a global scale in the event of a Landsat system failure and ensuing data gap.  Interested parties from U.S. or international industry and/or government programs are welcome to respond. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) that seeks to identify potential suppliers of moderate resolution satellite data with characteristics reasonably similar to those of Landsat to cover the global landmass at least twice per year - cloud free or nearly so. This data requirement is defined by the "Gap-filler Data: Acceptable Specifications" shown below in the list of performance parameters.  These Acceptable Specifications were developed by a multi-agency Landsat Data Gap Study Team.  Data meeting these Acceptable Specifications would replace (in quantity and quality) a portion of the Landsat data stream should Landsat fail but may also be useful for ongoing augmentation of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) beginning in 2011.  If obtained, Gap-filler data would be placed in the USGS satellite archive and distributed to the Landsat user community under the current unrestricted data-use policy. It is anticipated that any significant procurement of Gap-filler data would not occur before FY2008, although it is possible that data could be needed sooner.   Performance Parameters							 SPECTRAL BANDS: Landsat Goal Specifications, Blue: 450-515 nm; Green: 525-600 nm; Red: 630-680 nm; NIR: 845-885 nm; SWIR(1) 1560-1660 nm; SWIR(2) 2100-2300 nm; TIR(1) 10300-11300 nm; TIR(2) 11500-12500 nm.  Gap-Filler Data Acceptable Specifications, Green: 525-600 nm; Red: 630-680 nm; NIR: 780-900 nm, SWIR(1) 1560-1660 nm RADIOMETRY: Landsat Goal Specifications, <5% error in at-sensor radiance, linearly scaled to image data.Gap-Filler Data Acceptable Specifications, <5% error in at-sensor radiance, linearly scaled to image data  SPATIAL RESOLUTION: Landsat Goal Specifications, 30m GSD VNIR-SWIR; 15m panchromatic. Gap-Filler Data Acceptable Specifications, 10-100m GSD GEOGRAPHIC REGISTRATION: Landsat Goal Specifications, <65m (90% circular error). Gap-Filler Data Acceptable Specifications, <65m (90% circular error) BAND-BAND REGISTRATION: Landsat Goal Specifications, uncertainty <4.5m (0.15 pixel). Gap-Filler Data Acceptable Specifications, uncertainty <4.5m (0.15 pixel) GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE: Landsat Goal Specifications, All land areas between ± 81.2º north and south latitudes, including islands, atolls, and continental shelf regions of less than 50m water depth. Gap-Filler Data Acceptable Specifications, All land areas between ± 81.2º north and south latitudes. Instructions for Respondents Please provide a response that indicates your capability to comply with the above Gap-Filler Data Acceptable Specifications.  For example, show and discuss any differences from the nominal bandwidths.  Acquired data will be characterized and verified against these specifications to ensure data quality and continuity. Data processing could be performed by the provider or by the USGS with provided ground processing systems/algorithms needed for creating Level 0 and Level 1 orthorectified products.   The USGS is also interested in learning about new approaches or new technology for collection of Gap-filler data even if they do not meet the entire Acceptable Specifications criteria and twice-annual global coverage.  For example frequent coverage of Gap-filler data limited to the conterminous U.S. would be considered, as would the concept of frequent global coverage with more limited spectral bands than Landsat.  Providers may provide base pricing, only as a matter of interest, to the USGS.     A formal solicitation or contract may or may not result from this R

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Agfa Corporation.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of McGuire Air Force Base.  This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Soliciting from a single source.  Description:  The Government has a requirement for three (3) Barco Coronis 5 Mega Pixel (5MP) LCD gray scale monitors as an upgrade to the current Barco Coronis CRT monitors being used for radiological screening and testing.  The sole source determination is based on the fact that the monitors must be purchased from Agfa Corporation to ensure system compatibility since the monitors are an upgrade to the current Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) system.  The monitors connect to a graphics card that is designed to work only with monitors provided by Agfa, so an upgrade to the system monitors must be purchased from Agfa to ensure system compatibility. Additionally, the warranty and service maintenance agreements already in place will only continue if the monitors are purchased from and installed by Agfa.    No solicitation package will be issued.  This is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by February 26, 2007, no later than 10:00am, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  POC: Anita Tolliver and Deborah Anderson, GovWorks, 381 Elden Street, Suite 4000, Herndon, Virginia, 20170.  Questions must be e-mailed to Anita.Tolliver@mms.gov and Deborah.Anderson@mms.gov.  Telephonic questions or requests will not be accepted or acknowledged.

Question and Answers

Question – The demountable partition system will be unstable when the ceiling system is removed, this is necessitated by the construction outlined in items 2, 4, 7 and 9.  Therefore, is GSA planning to remove and reinstall the partitions or will they be protected and laterally braced during the construction phase?

Answer – GSA will not be doing anything to support, nor will we be removing and replacing wall systems.  That must be considered a design element and the construction contractor will be required to take this issue into consideration.

Question – If the new lighting and mechanical system change the plenum height then will the scope of work include the selection and specification of a new demountable partition system?

Answer – GSA is not changing any wall systems under this project.

Question – Are there any hazardous materials in the building?

Answer – Based upon the PDS report the following is noted:  The work on this site will require the various materials be properly handled.  These include fluids associated with removing the existing generator (i.e. diesel fuel, antifreeze, battery acid and oil), fluorescent lamps (mercury) and old magnetic ballasts (possible PCB’s).  The only known asbestos in the building is in the floor tiles in the Ground Floor and in the Second Floor elevator lobby.  This project should not disturb those tiles and no asbestos abatement is contemplated.

Question – Will the roof top work, items 1 and 3 necessitate removal and replacement of the roof membrane?  If so, will this work be done under this project or a separate project?  Of the roof is replaced will a “green” roof would be required to improve the roof performance and reduce energy consumption?

Answer – No, the roof is currently being solicited for replacement with a September ’06 finish date under a separate contract.  It is anticipated that there will be a newly installed roof at the time this project begins.

Question – Will the building exterior glass be replaced under a separate contract to improve it performance and reduce energy consumption?

Answer – No

Question – The central toilet rooms are accessible.  Will all toilet rooms be modified as part of this work?

Answer – If the rest-rooms are required to have sprinkler devices, then all rest-rooms will be included in the project.  Ventilation will be a part of the design as well.

Question – Will the day care system upgrades the performed in two phases to allow the daycare to remain on the first floor, in operation during construction?

Answer – Phasing issues to be determined during design.

Question – What is the projected construction cost of the scope of construction items 1 through 9?

Answer – Refer to the synopsis/amendment

Question – Will the elevators and stairs be renovated as part of prime objective number 3?

Answer – Work in the stairs with reference to the existing standpipes/installation of the sprinkler system is part of the project.

Question – What is the square footage of the building?

Answer – 636,434 GSF

Question – Is the parking structure included in the gross square feet provided in the project announcement?

Answer – No

Question – Who did the Program Development Study for this project?  When was it completed?

Answer – Architura, February 2004

Question – For our firm and designer portfolios, can we include projects where the design is complete, but not yet fully constructed?

Answer – GSA cannot direct firms on what or how to address the Request for Qualifications (RFQ)

<SOLNBR>REQUEST-FOR-INFORMATION
<RESPDATE>022307
<ARCHDATE>04242007
<CONTACT>Steven Foster, 732-427-1528
<DESC>NOTE: THE RESPONSE TIME FOR THIS RFI IS EXTENDED TO 23 FEBRUARY 2007.  Request for Information Title: Market Survey for Common Viewer Application Framework (CVAF) Technical POC Address Project Manager Battle Command (PM BC), ATTN: Henry Saphow, Build ing 2525, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703.   E-Mail: henry.saphow@us.army.mil   This Request for Information (RFI) is issued to survey the commercial services market for potential reuse of COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) software to be integrated into the U.S. Arm y Battle Command (BC) architecture in support of the U.S. Army Project M anager Battle Command (PM BC) for existing application frameworks that can serve as a Common Viewer Application Framework (CVAF). Description: Army BC is a System of Systems comprised  of the following tactical component: Army Battle Command Systems (ABCS), Communications/System Network and Hardware Enablers.  As Army migrates to Network Enabled Command Capability (NECC), based in part on the net- centric Service Oriented Architecture ( SOA), steps leading to that objective architecture required changes in the ABCS architecture.     A near-term BC core architecture has been defined.  The core architecture will be based on Microsoft Vista operating syste m, supported by the BC Common Servi ces (BCCS), Common Security, and CVAF. A Common Viewer smart client will be built using a CVAF. The Common Viewer smart client will serve as a template platform for deploying Army and Marine applications. CVAF is a techno logy and infrastructure centric fr amework and should not be confused with the Common Viewer Usability Engineering Framework being developed under the auspices of the OSD-sponsored Technology Transition Initiative (TTI) project.  The latter effort is techno logy agnostic and is focused on d eveloping a human factors centric framework. Operationally the CVAF is expected to operate on a common operating system (MS Windows Vista) and utilize a common set of tools, such as GIS/map data rendering.  A Common Viewer smart client, regardless of battl efield functional area, will run on top of the CVAF.   As an example a Maneuver or Fires user may log onto the common viewer platform running a common operating system (Vista) and common application framework, then launch specific Maneuver or Fires appli cations within the application framework.  After loading the plug-in into the CVAF, the user has the ability (from the same user interface provided by the CVAF to share data and events across other loaded plug-ins already running in the CVAF.  The CVAF w ill be consistent across the Army and Marine Land Force commanders and initially will be managed at the tactical level. These systems will use smart and thin client technology to access data and services available in the network. Smart clients wi ll provid e a rich user experience by using services and data on the network when connected and cache data for use during off-line operations; thin clients provide web-based capabilities during connected operations.  The CVAF will support Common Services an d user c onfigurable to support functional domain-unique services (i.e. Fires and Effects).  The CVAF shall enable smart clients that supports a common user interface (UI), a plug-in architecture, application collaboration, data sharing and GIS functionality using ESRI/CJMTK tools. The CVAF shall support a product line like concept that will enabl e capabilities to be built on-top of the framework as components/widgets. The framework will allow these components to be integrated by end system developers. This enables  C4ISR developers to share and develop specific domain capabilities. The goal is for these components to be controlled, but also open source so that end system developers can enhance the components as needed. Some important characteristics of CVAF are: sof tware availability, work disconnected, cache data locally, perform client side processing, Software Development Kit (SDK) availability, use of a Commercial Join t Mapping Tool Kit (ESRI/CJMTK) services, Plug-in Architecture (third party products), a data model architecture for application to application, and Collaboration across machines.  Attached is a questionnaire asking whether your product supports characteri stics presented.  Although it is not expected that all cha racteristics will be supported initially by a single product, the above characteristics, in addition to the life cycle cost will be a determining factor for the government to consider the product.  Instructions: This is a Request for Information only.  This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP). Interested parties should respond in a complete manner as possible to the 26 key factors below for the CVAF. For the technical question the how it can be ac complished is i mportant key as well.  Please reply in a short paragraphs what keys factors your software supports.  No special submission format is required (electronic format is preferred).  For additional information on your product, you may attach any pertinent commercial literature/briefings that you maintain. The government will not reimburse contractors or responders to this notice for any costs incurred in responding, or in subsequent exchange of information. All proprietary and restricted informati on shall be clea rly marked. Please respond no later than COB 23 February 2007. POC is Henry Saphow (henry.saphow@us.army.mil). Key Factors: 1 - Software Licensing 2 - Support Smart client framework (see note 1 ) 3 - Collaboration across machines IVIC (Int elligent Virtual Information Collaboration) (see note 2) 4 - Collaboration across machines (chat) (see note 2.1) 5 - Collaboration across machines (files) (see note 2.1) 6 - Collaboration across machines (video)(see note 2.1) 7 - Collaboration across machi nes (voice) (see note 2.1) 8 - Collaboration across machines (whiteboarding) (see note 2.1) 9 - Adaptable to other (3rd party) plug-in/tools (weather, terrain analysis, Microsoft products) (see note 3) 10 - Search multiple database (SQL) sources and displa y from them in both map graphical and tabular 11 - Developer     modifiable User Interface 12 - GIS  Renderer All ESRI/CJMTK Supported Map Data Products (Vector & Raster) 13 - GIS  Ability to Perform ESRI/CJMTK Analysis 14 - GIS  Read and Write to ESRI/ CJMTK Geo Database 15 - GIS  Use ESRI/CJMTK Symbology Such as MOLE 16 - Hardware requirements (Client/Server/Network) 17 - Display COP/UDOP (see note 4) 18 - Language written 19 - Platform (Windows, Linux, other Unix) 20 - SDK available 21 - Software matu rity     22 - User Base (commercial, military) 23 - User defined environment (see note 5) 24 - Network Performance (see note 6) 25 - Data Mining (see note 7) 26 - Software Schedule/availability Explanation/Definition: Note 1. Smart Client is an application  that uses local resources and provides a rich user experience; it's a connected application that exchanges data on the Internet or an enterprise network; even though it's a connected application, it is offline capable     so that it can be used whether or  not it is currently connected; and it has an intelligent deployment and update story, maintaining relatively the same ease of deployment and management as web applications. Note 2. Collaboration across machines IVIC (Intelligent Virtual Information Collab oration) is a method when all permitted parties (smart clients) have direct access to the information and can view, modify, annotate, and contribute to it at the finest grain     level (a unit on a map rather than a picture of the map itself). Data with in formation moves seamlessly among all users regardless of what visual format it is displayed in (maps, schedules, charts, etc.).     Items of interest can be highlighted and created new visualizations with different combinations of data in various visualiza tion types such as geo-referenced, time based or worksheet views.     Combined with an intuitive, easy to use interface, this enables users to express their tho ughts more completely fr om distan t locations. Note 2.1 Does the framework have built in support for these forms of collaboration or can it integrate or coexist with 3rd party solutions that perform these collaboration services? If so how? Note 3. Adaptab le to other plug-in/tools via the use of open standards (i.e.     XML/SOAP-based web-service) Note 4. Display COP/UDOP. Common Operating Picture and User Defined Operating Picture are terminology used by the DoD to describe what commander can see on his wo rkstation.     For this requirement we need to understand if any external DoD interfaces are supp orted that will allow working with the ESRI/CJMTK to render units, geometries and other graphics that are interfaced from external DoD systems in 2D/3D. Note 5. User defined environment- provide capability for the operator to select multiple views on multiple screens or on a single screen.     User generated new views either tabular, map and graphic Note 6.     Network performance for a smart client in a connec ted mode such as: information display latency, performance over low bandwidth (less than 1 mb/s), intermittent connectivity behavior, etc. Note 7. Data mining is the process of automatically searching large volumes of data for patterns (i.e. clustering, cl assification, defined rules, etc.) Does this CVAF possess any inherent capabilities to data mine based on the framework architecture?

Further detailed analysis of the government's requirements has resulted in a determination to eliminate the need to process claims submitted by active duty military.

Notification of the government's new requirement for a network of preferred providers for Active Duty Dental Program services will be published in the FedBizOpps at a future date.

These systems and components are located in the Fleet as well as land based sites in CONUS (Continental US) and OCONUS (Outside Continental US) locations.  The Navy intends to procure these support services on an FFP basis.  The proposed single solicitation vehicle would also allow the PBL services for the CASS system and the EO3 system to be awarded on separate IDIQ contracts.  This also allows each to be potentially awarded to separate contractors or all to one contractor.  Therefore, any potential awardee may bid on the support for both systems or on one system as listed separately on each CLIN.  The period of performance for each system?s base award shall be five years, with five one-year option periods, potentially totaling ten years for the entire contract performance.

The equipment should be based on WiMAX IEEE 802.16e and/or 802.16d specifications (including Subscriber Station, Mobile and Base Station).  The vision of USMC is to deploy WiMAX products possibly using both licensed and un-licensed frequency bands following the release-1 profiles covering 5, 7, 8.75, and 10 MHz channel bandwidths for licensed worldwide spectrum allocations in the 2.3 GHz, 2.5 GHz, 3.3 GHz, 3.5 GHz bands and unlicensed band products available in 5.8 GHz and 5.4 GHz. A summary should be provided of the capabilities in the areas of frequency bands, channel bandwidths, duplexing, frame lengths, smart antenna, Multiple Input Multiple Output (Space Time Coding and Collaborative), adaptive antenna system, transmit power, receiver sensitivity, handover, range, data rates, security/encryption, DFS, QoS (UGS, rtPS, …), priority and preemption, throughput and latency for different applications, subcarrier allocations (e.g. PUSC), sleep mode, multicast, BS sector antenna widths, PHY features (e.g. modulation/coding schemes and power control), and MAC features (e.g. ARQ and H-ARQ).   In addition to providing a summary of the above features, we are requesting complete Mobile Protocol Implementation Conformance Statements (PICS).  For the security/encryption capability, the response must address the compliance to the security features in the IEEE 802.16 core standards: IEEE 802.16d, IEEE 802.16-2004/Cor, and IEEE 802.16e-2005.  The response also needs to address the plan of meeting the requirements in the Government security policies: DoD Directive 8100.2 and FIPS 140-2 certification.   The response must address when you plan to have Mobile and Fixed WiMAX certified products (using Mobile and Fixed WiMAX System Profile and Certification Profiles).  The response should also list all the other frequency bands supported (licensed and unlicensed) for BS and mobiles that are not listed in the Certification Profiles.  The response needs to address form factor and types (e.g. CPE, handset, USB, PCMCIA, internet PDA).  The response needs to elaborate how to support multiple frequency bands, and if the support can be software tunable or requires change of hardware.  The response needs to address if the 802.16e product is backwards compatible with 802.16d specifications.  The response needs to indicate if there is an interest of supporting the IEEE 802.16j (mobile multi-hop relay) specification once it is ratified.  The response needs to address if it is possible to support base station mobility and how. MARCORSYSCOM will not pay or provide reimbursement for any costs incurred in the preparation or delivery of the request information.  Interested firms are requested to submit a capability statement outlining their ability to meet or exceed this potential requirement no later than 9 March 2007, stating their business size, NAICS Code, and identifying a corporate point of contact.

<SUBJECT>D -- SNOMED-CT and Related Services
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) National Institutes of Health (NIH) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a) and U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization, Copenhagen Hospital Corporation, Copenhagen, Denmark, for a multi-year contract as defined by FAR Part 17 Multi-Year Contracts (specifically, FAR Part 17.104, Part 17.105, & Part 17.106) .  The contract will provide NLM with at least twice-yearly updates to the English and Spanish versions of SNOMED CT, originally developed by the College of American Pathologists, and a license to incorporate SNOMED-CT updates into the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus (National Library of Medicine registered trademarks); to use SNOMED-CT within the UMLS Metathesaurus for research purposes within the NLM, in NLM?s production data creation systems, and in its publicly accessible retrieval systems; and to redistribute SNOMED-CT, within the UMLS Metathesaurus or otherwise, free-of-charge to U.S. entities for use within the U.S. for any health care, public health, research, educational, or statistical purposes.  SNOMED-CT is a comprehensive, multi-axial, controlled terminology intended for use in patient, public health, and research data.  SNOMED CT has been recommended as U.S. standard by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics, has been adopted as a U.S.-government wide standard by the interagency Consolidated Health Informatics Initiative, and is part of several U.S. Interoperability Specifications recently released by the Health Information Technology Standards Panel under contract to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, Department of Health and Human Services.  In June 2003, NLM entered into a 5-year contract with the College of American Pathologists to obtain updates to SNOMED CT under similar license terms.  The College of American Pathologists has announced its intention to transfer their intellectual property in SNOMED-CT to the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization in early 2007 (reference FAR 52.217-2 Cancellation with respect to contract cancellation).

Since SNOMED-CT will then become a proprietary product of the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization, NLM has determined that the International Health Terminology Standards Development Organization is the only source capable of providing the software and the ongoing software updates. Responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.

Capability statements and related materials must be received in this office by 4:00 p.m. EST on the closing date of this announcement.     
 		
If you have any questions, please contact Maxwell Kimpson at (301) 496-6546 or by email at kimpsonm@mail.nlm.nih.gov.  Collect calls will not be accepted.

The determination to compete or not compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>41 -- American Embassy Kinshasa Standardization of Air Conditioning Units
<DESC>The American Embassy Kinshasa located in the Democratic Republic of Congo in equatorial Africa intends to standardize on LG air conditioning units for Government-owned and leased properties.  The goal is to implement and apply commonality, standardization, and interoperability amongst all air condition units operated in Government-owned and leased properties at post.  In addition, standardization reduces maintenance and overhead costs.  The Government believes that only one responsible manufacturer can provide the supplies/services that will satisfy the Agency Standardization Program requirements under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  

Environmental conditions and power fluctuations create a continuing need to repair and/or replace air conditioning units that become unserviceable or uneconomical to maintain or operate.  Replacing electronic components in a timely manner is difficult as local companies do not consistently and reliably stock replacement parts from other manufacturers.

Standardization provides a cost effective solution and reduces maintenance and overhead costs by reducing excessive and unnecessary costs that are involved in stocking parts, tools and equipment necessary to service various air conditioning units from multiple manufacturers.  Keeping an adequate inventory of spare parts for numerous manufacturers is very difficult and expensive.  Cannibalization and interchangeability of parts of the same manufacturer minimizes disruption to post operations.

This announcement is for informational purposes only; it is not a request for proposals or quotations.  Interested firms may email capability statements to Ms. Jan Visintainer at the email address listed below.  Capability statements must be received by February 16, 2006.  A determination by the Government to standardize this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

In all cases, the efforts require access to space-based assets using multiple ground stations.  Furthermore, the nature of the system development requires secure autonomous machine-to-machine scheduling of such asset.   To support the three inter-related research efforts, NASA’s Earth/Sun Science Technology Office (ESTO) is funding NASA Glenn Research Center for development of autonomous, automated service agreements between the secure autonomous intelligent controller and ground systems.  These autonomous, automated service agreements will enable NASA to obtain near real-time access to space-based assets – in this case the Cisco router in Low Earth Orbit (CLEO) onboard the Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) United Kingdom - Disaster Monitoring Constellation satellite (UK-DMC).   2	PURPOSE The overlying goal of this effort is to define and enhance standard approaches for internetworking of space and ground assets.   The Contractor shall coordinate with Universal Space Networks (USN) and Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) to provide autonomous, automated scheduling of  SSTL’s UK-DMC and USN’s ground stations.  In addition, if additional ground assets become available, the methodology used for autonomously scheduling of USN’s and SSTL’s assets shall be applicable to scheduling of others’ ground station support.	   . 3	TASK 1 – DEVELOPMENT, TEST AND VERIFICATION OF SECURE, AUTONOMOUS, AUTOMATIC SCHEDULING TECHNOLOGY The Contractor shall develop and implement algorithms and code in a virtual mission operations center (VMOC) necessary to enable secure, autonomous, automatic scheduling of SSTL’s UK-DMC and USN’s ground assets.	 USN’s ground stations that are capable of communication with the UK-DMC are located in Hawaii, Alaska, and Australia.    The basic concept of operations is shown in figure 1.  Some event such a volcano eruption, earth quake, tsunami or flood is sensed by a remote sensor web.  The remote sensor web send and event trigger to the VMOC.	 The VMOC notes the location of the event and determines what space-base resource is available.  In this instance only one space-based resource is available, the UK-DMC.	The VMOC then negotiates with SSTL for availability of the asset.  Once availability is determined, the VMOC determines what ground support infrastructure is available for both commanding and data retrieval.   The VMOC then attempts to schedule these ground assets.   If a conflict exists the process is re-initiated, otherwise, the assets are scheduled and commanding and data retrieval is performed.  Once the space-based sensor data is available via the VMOC, the VMOC will notify the end users as to the availability and location of such data.	 3.1	Development and Test •	The Contractor shall develop a work plan and schedule in accordance with the period of performance to be approved by the NASA Contract Officer Technical Representative (COTR) (See F.3 Reports of Work (GRC 522.227-118) (b) •	The Contractor shall develop an implementation and test plan to be approved by the NASA COTR •	The Contractor shall develop and implement secure autonomous automated scheduling algorithms for SSTL’s DMC satellites and USN’s ground stations.   •	The Contractor shall test, verify and demonstrate operation of the overall secure, autonomous, automated scheduling system in accordance with the test plan.  The test shall be witnessed by the by NASA COTR or their designated representative.   Test shall be performed according to the test plan and approved by the COTR after demonstration of live testing as witnessed by the COTR or their designated representative. 3.2	Documentation Support The Contractor shall document and maintain configuration control using established internal processes and procedures. 3.3	Deliverables Schedule Test and Implementation Plan Demonstration Brief Quarterly Report  Final Report 3.4	Schedules Week 0 – Contract Award Week 2 – Work Plan and Schedule Week 4 – Test and Implementation Plan December 2007 – Test and Demonstration December 31, 2007 – Final Report 3.5	Period Of Performance Contract Initiation to 31 December 2007 3.6	Special Considerations 3.6.1	NASA currently has a three year contract with USN for up to 60 Satellite passes per year.  Any required requests for USN ground infrastructure support for satellite pass shall be paid for under NASA’s current contract with USN and should not be consider in the costing and billing of this contract. 3.6.2	If the UK-DMC becomes unavailable due to loss of satellite or other reason not under the control of The Contractor or NASA, an alternative space platform my be considered (e.g, TACSAT). 4	TASK II OPTION – ENHANCEMENTS TO THE AUTOMATED SCHEDULING TECHNOLOGY TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL GROUND AND SPACE ELEMENTS This task is to allow NASA to enhance the secure, autonomous, automated scheduling system. The Contractor shall enhance the VMOC’s secure, autonomous, automated scheduling system by adding additional ground and/or space-based assets into the system.	Such ground-base assets may include ground stations operated by third parties such as the European Space Agency or Japan’s National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT).  Space assets may include other DMC satellites or the Tactical Satellite being funding by the United States the Office of Force Transformation (OFT).  The enhanced concept of operations is shown in figure 2. 4.1	  Development and Test •	The Contractor shall develop a schedule in accordance with the period of performance to be approved by the NASA Contract Officer Technical Representative (COTR) •	The Contractor shall develop and implementation and test plan to be approved by the NASA COTR •	The Contractor shall develop and implement secure autonomous automated scheduling algorithms for the specified satellites and /or the specified  ground stations.   •	The Contractor shall test, verify and demonstrate operation of the overall secure, autonomous, automated scheduling system in accordance with the test plan.  The overall approval and determination of success shall be by the NASA COTR. 4.2	Documentation Support The Contractor shall document and maintain configuration control using established internal processes and procedures. 4.3	Deliverables Schedule Test and Implementation Plan Demonstration Brief Quarterly Report  Final Report 4.4	Schedules Week 0 – Contract Award Week 2 – Work Plan and Schedule  Week 6 – Test and Implementation Plan December 2008 – Test and Demonstration December 31, 2009 – Final Report 4.5	Period Of Performance 1 January 2008 to 31 December  2009 4.6	Special Considerations 4.6.1	NASA currently has a three year contract with USN for up to 60 Satellite passes per year.  Any required requests for USN ground infrastructure support for satellite pass shall be paid for under NASA’s current contract with USN and should not be consider in the costing and billing of this contract.

Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Directed Energy (DE) Contracting Directorate (PKDB), 2251 Maxwell Ave. SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5773


A.	INTRODUCTION: 

The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Directed Energy Directorate(DE) located at Kirtland AFB NM is interested in receiving proposals in the five technical areas under Light Innovation Technologies (LITE). The total program budget for these efforts is $24M over 60 months. The projected start date will be during the third quarter of FY07. 

Proposals are due by 12:00 p.m. Mountain Standard Time, 27 March 2007.  PLEASE REALIZE THIS FUNDING PROFILE IS AN ESTIMATE ONLY, IS NOT A PROMISE FOR FUNDING, AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE DUE TO GOVERNMENT DISCRETION AND AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS. AFRL will not issue a separate solicitation. AFRL is distributing this BAA electronically through FedBizOpps at http://www.fbo.gov. Once there, offerors should enter BAA 07-DE-02 into the search option to reach the posting. 

B.	REQUIREMENT DESCRIPTION/TOPIC AREAS:

Topic Area 1: Real-time Optical Surveillance Applications (ROSA)

?	Technical point-of-contact:  Ms. Laura Ulibarri, AFRL/DESM 808-891-7737

?	Technical solutions should address development of robust and pioneering algorithms and software tools that will process significant amounts of real-time Electro-Optic (EO) Space Situational Awareness (SSA) data and produce real-time, high-accuracy change detection information in very low light conditions, as well as software to integrate tasking and data integration from networks of EO sensors with disparate capabilities: wavelength coverage, imaging resolution, phenomenology, platform, etc. The next generation of EO SSA sensors must handle complex tasking and operations, and will require a minimal amount of human in the loop to ensure the correct objects were being tracked and the correct information was collected. Technologies developed will include intelligent agent autonomous algorithms, databasing, novel search techniques, and real-time processing software for anomaly detection and cueing of active (laser) and passive EO systems. Estimated funding is $10,000,000.

(In this area the Government contemplates an Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery (ID/IQ) CPFF contract vehicle with an ordering period of 5 years. Offerors shall provide a technical proposal for the basic ID/IQ contract, and a cost and technical proposal for proposed initial Task Order plus an additional task order representative of the overarching Contractor Statement of Work for the basic contract. The initial Task Order should focus on development and demonstration of an initial proof of concept that provides a small scale demonstration of the capabilities for integrated tasking and fusion of networked EO sensors. It should be emphasized that we are looking for innovative solutions in this area that will provide the technical basis for enhanced Space Situational Awareness solutions. This effort should be completed within a year and within a budget of approximately $1.2M.  Offerors should contact the technical point of contact designated above for additional information regarding the focus of the first task order.) 

Topic Area 2: Adaptive Optics Improvements

?	Technical POC LtCol Scott Hunt, 808-874-1513  and Dr Earl Spillar (DSN 246-6740, comm 505-846-6740)

?	The Air Force Research Laboratories Optics Division would like to improve the reliability, maintainability, and performance of its existing adaptive optics systems for advanced research and development enabled by adaptive optics technology. In order to provide maximum flexibility this topic consists of two separate tasks. Offerors may propose to one or both tasks.

?	SubTask 1?AMOS Adaptive Optics Tracker and Wavefront Sensor subsystems
?	Requirements should address design and development of an improved Adaptive Optics Tracker and Wavefront Sensor subsystem for the Air Force Maui Optical and Supercomputing (AMOS) Site?s 3.6-meter telescope. Solutions providing high reliability, easy maintenance and high performance for high resolution imaging and sodium laser guidestar (Na LGS) beacon for dim objects are required. This effort should include ideas for developing a modular system and interface with the adaptive optics electronics identified in Task 2 of this topic area. Out-of-the-box thinking is encouraged to develop a low-latency system providing exceptional performance on dim objects. System reliability and performance are key, however re-use of existing system components may provide cost savings. This task will also cover integration and testing of the integrated tracker, wavefront sensor and electronics subsystem (developed under Task 2) prior to delivery as well as integration and testing with the 3.6-m telescope.
?	SubTask 2?Adaptive Optics Electronic subsystem
?	Requirements should address design and development of an improved Electronic subsystem for the Air Force Maui Optical and Supercomputing (AMOS) Site?s 3.6-meter telescope and Starfire Optical Range?SOR?s 3.5-meter telescope. A flexible adaptive optics electronics subsystem which is capable of interfacing with multiple AO Tracker and Wavefront sensor subsystems is required. Applications for this processor will require good latency supporting a large number of channels, and the desire is deterministic timing and data output from the processor to understand system performance. Flexibility to program multiple operating modes and adjust between various control modes on the fly is desirable. The processor should be flexible enough to accommodate additional channels to allow for expansion, such as the integration of a separate WFS for Na LGS operation and focus control.  Flexible collection and reporting of performance data, diagnostics to assist in integration and characterization of tracker, wavefront and optic subsystems is desired. The estimated funding is $3,300,000.


Topic Area 3: Advanced Research Adaptive Optics Prototype

?	Technical POC, Earl Spillar, (DSN 246-6740, comm 505-846-6740)

?	This task involves development of a research-grade AO electronics control prototype for advanced AO research.  Flexibility in the design should allow for testing of sophisticated reconstructors, sensors, and deformable mirror configurations.  For example, these sensors may include self-referencing interferometers, shearing interferometers or other advanced concepts.  The prototype should be able to accommodate a large number of actuators and sensed sub apertures, possibly distributed across multiple deformable mirrors.  Ability to develop, test and accommodate advanced reconstruction techniques for self referencing interferometers, exponential reconstructors, and other advanced concepts is required. The estimated funding is $500K.

Topic Area 4: Hyper/multispectral Data Reduction and Archiving (HyDRA) 

?	Technical POC Mr. Bob Kim (DSN 263-7806, Comm 505 853-7806)

?	For Spectral Geographic Information System database solutions to enhance target acquisition and fire control for tactical high energy laser systems, such as Relay Systems. This task will provide pre/post flight and real time software advancements in target identification and change/anomaly detection for multispectral and hyperspectral surveillance and targeting sensors.
HyDRA scope of interest to AFRL/VS as well?working to develop collaborations. The estimated funding is $10,000,000.

Topic Area 5: Advanced Architecture Concept Study for Advanced Beam Control

?	Technical POC Dr Paul Merritt (DSN 263-5477, Comm 505 853 5477)

?	Conceptualize innovative beam control architectures for conventional (single beam) systems such as advanced pointing and tracking systems.  These new concepts may apply to alignment jitter rejection, adaptive optics, gimbal pointing, tracking, pointing, or a combination of control functions.  An inertial reference shall be included if applicable. Size and weight will be a major consideration. Considerations for base motion and aero-optics are important. The estimated funding is $300K.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107?296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held- 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
   
 (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107?296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:

    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) within USAID is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in responding to international crises and disasters.  It is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA). To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA maintains five permanent regional offices and one sub-regional office. The regional offices are located in San Jose, Costa Rica, Bangkok, Thailand, Dakar, Senegal, Nairobi, Kenya, and Pretoria, South Africa. The Asia sub-regional office is located in Kathmandu, Nepal.  

The vulnerability of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries to natural, technological, and conflict-related disasters has increased in recent years due to population pressures, urbanization and habitation of marginal lands, large investments in infrastructure in vulnerable areas, rapid and uncontrolled industrialization, and other factors. The capacity of many LAC countries to manage disasters has substantially grown in recent years. Many countries are now generally capable of managing disasters up to moderate severity without external assistance. In major events, however, most countries  in the region face a serious risk of having their overall coping capacities overwhelmed by disaster response requirements.

OFDA's strategy in Latin America and the Caribbean seeks to reduce the demand for disaster relief, principally by increased preparedness and mitigation activities at the national and community level, and by strengthening governments' capacity to meet immediate post disaster needs so as to prevent deterioration in the situation of disaster victims.

INTRODUCTION

OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance. DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

OBJECTIVE

LAC Regional Team requires the services of a Regional Advisor in its regional office in San Jose, Costa Rica, to ensure that OFDA's objectives for strategic analysis, coordination of disaster response activities, monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded activities, and identification and formulation of disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region are effectively met.  

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

This position requires an individual who is able to travel outside of Costa Rica on short notice for up to two-three weeks at a time, or longer, on occasion. The contractor will actively develop and coordinate preparedness, mitigation and training programs to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations (IOs), and non governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region. In addition, this position requires general professional proficiency [equivalent to Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) level 3, or higher] in speaking and writing the Spanish language, in order to work effectively in the region.

Focusing primarily on Latin America and the Caribbean countries, the Regional Advisor will be responsible for the following:

Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the Senior Regional Advisor, the contractor will:

* Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and conduct initial assessments of damages and needs; determine appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions, in consultation with Washington and/or the Senior Regional Advisor; 
* Coordinate and maintain close liaison with senior representatives of host government, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. Embassy, and USAID missions to ensure efficient and coordinated disaster response activities;
* Monitor DCHA/OFDA funded activities; 
* Approve OFDA relief supply requests in consultation with OFDA Washington and coordinate receipt, distribution, tracking, and accounting of supplies;
* Facilitate and coordinate the arrival and departure of  DARTs with the U.S. Mission and, as required, serve on DARTs for short periods of time;
* Prepare field information and reports, as required by the OFDA/LAC regional office and OFDA/Washington. 

Disaster Preparedness - Working closely with the OFDA/LAC regional office and OFDA/Washington, and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the contractor will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.

Specifically, the contractor will:

* Prepare regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries;
* Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance for OFDA, USAID, local governments, and other donors/organizations as appropriate;
* Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA efforts including the review of sector disaster response and plans;
* Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the LAC Regional Office.  Support may include assessment visits, project design/evaluation exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;
* Coordinate with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries and develop projects/activities for addressing these;
* Work with senior representatives of local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate preparedness and mitigation into appropriate programs.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:

The following justification for the HP brand name requirement is provided in accordance with the requirements of FAR 5.102(a)(6):

The DLA IDE Program currently consists of three (3) operational system environments which include Development servers, Test servers, and live Production servers operating solely on HP-UX 11i Unix operating system, and  HP servers.  This architectural design provides several benefits, including enhanced scalability, availability, flexibility, and full IDE system integration.

The Development, Test, and Production environments received the Interim Authority To Operate (IATO) in November 2005 and Authority To Operate (ATO) in January 2006.  The DLA IDE system has been in Initial Operational Capability (IOC) status since January 2006, supporting data brokering for multiple DLA programs.
 
Due to budgetary constraints, the DLA IDE program has not procured the Stage and COOP systems, which form the basis of the current requirement.   Presidential Decision Directive 67 and DoD Directive 3020.26 require that Government systems have a COOP plan and invest in the appropriate infrastructure to support the plan.  A Stage system is required to support software engineering efforts and quality assurance of the IDE product, which is congruent with Better Business Practice (BBP) for standard software engineering and development lifecycle.  The requirement at hand seeks to address the need for the HP-UX COOP and Staging servers to complete the IDE server landscape.      

The fact that the current IDE Development, Test, and Production servers run solely in an HP-UX 11i operating environment on HP equipment, makes the HP-UX solution the prudent and required architecture choice for both the Stage and COOP requirements.  There are a number of considerations that underscore this fact.  A COOP environment must provide a reliable, accessible, and consistent backup environment for the production server.  This is a critical safeguard in the event of system outages at the primary facility.  In the case of UNIX, this typically mandates that all hardware environments be binary compatible with the primary production environment hardware.  Without binary compatibility between the Production and COOP environments, an application running in the Production environment would need to be recompiled, redeveloped, retested, or even replaced in order to run effectively.  This process would be labor intensive, necessitating additional skill sets be obtained by the current contractor support staff.  Therefore extensive migration efforts would be required to transfer software code from one architecture to another.  The IDE system is a Mission Assurance Category (MAC) II program.  Implementing a dissimilar architecture to the current IDE system would make it impossible to support MAC II restoration requirements; therefore, it is an unrealistic approach that is not in the best interest of the Government.           

Another challenge with supporting disparate architectures in the COOP and Stage environments with respect to the Development, Test, and Production environments is that, like any operating system, most software applications have hardware dependencies as well.  So the applications being hosted are typically specific to an operating system release.  Therefore, system recertification efforts would be required to ensure information assurance and network security compliance.  The effort involved in designing, configuring and applying/resolving Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) in disparate environments is significant.  These efforts would involve a considerable duplication of costs and time spent.  

In summary, the procurement of HP brand name for the Stage and COOP servers complements the existing HP Production, Test, and Development environments and is essential the Government?s requirement, thus, the only reasonable solution for the IDE Program.  Deviating from the current HP architecture would necessitate significant application redevelopment, cost and introduces unnecessary risks to DLA?s IDE program.   

The Government will consider offers from HP and HP authorized resellers.  Offered products must be covered by warranty equivalent to or greater in coverage than that offered to commercial customers.  Offers are due no later than 5:00 PM EST Friday, February 16, 2007.  Offers must include the representations and certifications required by FAR 52.212-3 and DFARS 252.212-7000.  Also, to evaluate past performance, the Government requires that prospective offerors provide information on three (3) previous Government IT contracts that it has been awarded.  Please include the following information: Government contract number, date of award, issuing agency, and Government POC name and telephone number.  This information should be provided with the offer.  It should be noted that offerors that have not received prior Government IT contracts will not be viewed negatively or positively, but rather neutral in terms of evaluation.  Offers shall be submitted to the contract specialist via e-mail (Joseph.Fortuna@dla.mil).  Contact the contract specialist via telephone at 703-767-9562 for further information.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  STATEMENT OF WORK(SOW) REPLACE CD-HAWK ICS SYSTEM  1. SCOPE OF WORK. The Pease central heat plant is made up of 3 each high temperature hot water boilers. Each boiler has a flame guard control system. In 2004 one of the three systems were replaced and Civil Engineering is looking to replace the other two c ontrol systems this year. Currently the old systems are still functioning however because of the age they are now obsolete and can no longer be repaired. The system is made up of components no longer attainable. In the event a system goes down it could tak e 10 weeks to replace which would mean the loss of one of the 3 boilers. In extreme cold temperatures this would effect every facility on base with cooler than normal temperatures. Replacing the second system will bring us closer to 100% reliability of the se controls during the heating season.   2. DESCRIPTION OF WORK. The work consists of furnishing all plant, labor, materials, and transportation for a complete and functional replacement of the existing CB-Hawk ICS heat plant boiler operating system. The work would need to take place while the he at plant is in operation allowing the remaining two boilers to function at 100% not to affect the base mission. Work will include the following: 2.1. Remove obsolete CB-Hawk ICS operating system. 2.2. Install new CB-Hawk ICS (intermediate system package) operating system.  3.  SPECIFICATIONS.

1.  Medical Records Posting. Can you please supply us with the Name of the Vendor or System that is currently used to store and manage your Electronic Medical Records?

At a minimum the data will be made available to the vender via an ASCII delimited text file.  The long term strategy (1 yr) is to transmit the data via an HL7 interface.

2.  Section 2.5	Unretrieved Results. Do the outbound telephone calls to patient that don't access their information via WEB or inbound telephone system need to be performed by a LIVE operator or can the call be an automated call? A.  Automated call processes are preferred.

All companies submitting bids will be considered using the evaluation criteria outlined in the Solicitation.    

5.  Is the government willing to consider extending the response date for two weeks instead of one week?  A.  Unfortunately, the customer needs a system in place as soon as possible, so there will be no extension.

AMENDMENT 02 TO RFP HSTS03-07-R-ACQ913:  The purpose of this amendment is to publicize responses to questions submitted between January 31 and February 5, 2007.

***Question 1: The conflict of interest issue is stated as being relative to other TSA contracts, yet the current contract information request also includes other DHS contracts causing some need for clarification as to the actual intent of the provision.  While the unfair advantage aspect of knowing what TSA future work might be( if one were awarded this RFP) is easily understood as a conflict of interest; how other non-related DHS might create a conflict of interest is not clear.  Would providing strategic management support services to TSA under this contract be considered a conflict of interest with other DHS work such as planning, training and exercising for Preparedness and/ or FEMA and/ or the Coast Guard?  Please clarify.  

Answer 1:  Offerors are expected to review the requirements of any solicitations they plan to propose on and/or any current work with TSA and other DHS components to better anticipate potential conflicts of interest.  

***Question 2: In developing our cost, have you established an estimate of labor hours for each of the requirements?

Answer 2: Our expectation is for offerors to propose the labor categories and annual rates that would be utilized for any resultant task order(s).

***Question 3: Do you have an organization chart or a directory of locations where the services may be performed?

Answer 3:  The resultant BPAs will be for TSA-wide use.

***Question 4: What is the cost of the current conager/Team Lead is considered key personnel.  The offeror may elect to have one or more key personnel.

***Question 5: Please define the Labor Categories along with a description of each, including the Number of Years of Experience, Skill Expertise and Education Qualifications. 

Answer 5:  Our expectation is for offerors to propose the labor categories and descriptions of each that shall be used to fulfill any task order requests for the duration of the BPA.

***Question 6: Please clarify whether the Past Performance Narrative is included in the page count. 

Answer 6: Past performance references is not included in the page count limitation.  The Past Performance Survey to be completed and submitted by the offeror?s reference(s) is not included in the page count limitation.

***Question 7: In the subject Statement of Work on page 1 paragraph 4; ?Specific requirements of these task orders are detailed below under Technical Requirements.  The contractor must be capable of providing proven technical support for all specific tasks described under Technical Requirements.?  Does the government want each task addressed separately or should the responder organize the technical response as directed on page 5 of the SOW by the listed evaluation factors (described in the RFP on page 2) and correlate to specific tasks listed?

Answer 7:  Organization of the content of the technical volume to best demonstrate the offeror?s understanding of and ability to fulfill the requirements stated in the SOW is at the offeror?s discretion.  

***Question 8: Does the 15 page limitation for Volume 1 Technical Response include pages for past performance descriptions?

Answer 8:  No.

***Question 9: Since this is a BPA with task orders related to SOW tasks, please provide clarification that OCI restriction for both primes and subs, applies on a task order by task order basis.  

Answer 9: The OCI restriction applies on a task order basis.

AMENDMENT 03 TO RFP HSTS03-07-R-ACQ913:  The purpose of this amendment is to publicize responses to questions submitted on February 6, 2007.

***Question 1: Page 6 of 24 of the RFP states that past performances can be submitted for subcontractors.  Must subcontractors meet the NAICS codes?  If not will the 51% prime work share apply to the BPA as a whole or to individual Task Orders?

Answer 1: Subcontractors do not need to meet the NAICS code.  The 51% applies to performance on task orders.

***Question 2: Page 7 of 24 in the RFP states that contractors can submit an OCI mitigation plan, page 8 of Attachment 1 says an OCI plan will not be considered.  Can an OCI mitigation plan be submitted?

Answer 2: Offerors may submit a Mitigation Plan for each resultant task order.  On page 8 of the Statement of Work (Attachment 1 of the RFP), the sentence ?An OCI mitigation plan will not be considered? is hereby replaced with ?An OCI mitigation plan will be considered on an individual basis for each task order?.  

***Question 3: Will all TOs be competed?  If so, what will the process be?

Answer 3: All BPA Calls/Task Orders will be competed amongst all BPA awardees via request for quotation.

***Question 4: Page 5 of 24 in the RFP states that ?Offeror?s technical response shall include resumes of proposed key staff that will oversee the BPA.?  Later in the same paragraph, it states that ?A Program Manager/Team Lead shall be assigned for this effort.? Is are these the same key person and does the government expect that only one key personnel will over see the BPA?

Answer 4:  The Program Man***Question 5: Is the security requirement just a NACI check and SSI briefing, or is there another security clearance requirement?  If there is another type of requirement, what is the type and level of the security clearance required?

Answer 5:  All on-site contractors are required, at a minimum, to adhere to TSA AMS clause 3.14.6 (Pre-Employment Security Screening of Offeror Employees).  Additional security clearance requirements will vary with each resultant task order.

***Question 6: Section 14, Key Personnel states that resumes for key people must be included within the proposal.  However, subparagraph (g) which defines key personnel is blank.  Are you requesting that bidder define key personnel positions for this BPA, or are there no key person requirements?

Answer 6: Section XIV (g) is blank because offerors are expected to identify/list the key personnel in that space. 

***Question 7: Is there any guidance or prior history to guide the types of CLINS that vendors should propose in the pricing portion (i.e. specific CLINS TSA has purchased in prior contracts of this nature)? 

Answer 7: No. ODCs such as authorized travel may be proposed.  We do not anticipate ODCs for materials. Audit approved G&A may be applied to the ODCs.

***Question 8: Since travel destinations and volume are undefined at this point, should we assume travel as a separate cost-reimbursement item to be provided at Task Order stage? 

Answer 8: Travel will be addressed on any task order request for quotation.

***Question 9: Will the identified program manager for this BPA (as required by Section IV Submission requirements, sub section Volume 1 Technical Response) be required to be physically on-site at TSA?  If so, is this on-site at the Arlington location?

Answer 9:  The program manager is not required to be on-site at TSA.  A BPA does not guarantee work.

***Question 10: Is it possible for a teammate/subcontractor to disclose current/on-going work at TSA and DHS via a sealed package directed to the Contracting Officer?  Will this count against our technical proposal page count?

Answer 10: Yes, past performance references may be submitted via sealed package.  That information will not count towards the page limitation. The past performance information must be received by the RFP closing date and time to be considered.

AMENDMENT 04 TO RFP HSTS03-07-R-ACQ913:  The purpose of this amendment is to publicize responses to questions submitted on February 7, 2007.

***Question 1: Can TSA direct potential bidders to the section of the TSA AMS that specifies the requirement that 51% of the work be done by the small business ?prime? vs. small business ?in general? or even that 51% of the work on a small business set aside must be performed by small business at all?  

Answer 1: Please see TSA AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting.

***Question 2: Also, will TSA reconsider a broader use of Contractor Team Arrangements to meet the requirements of the RFP and potentially avoid the situation described in Question and Answer 11 (of Amendment 1 posted on January 31, 2007).  

Answer 2: The RFP states that offerors may elect to enter into a teaming arrangement to fulfill the requirements.

***Question 3: Although TSA is not subject to the FAR, will TSA allow Contractor Team Arrangements, more explicitly outlined in the FAR than in the TSA AMS (and also referenced under FAR 9.601-9.603), by multiple small business in order to meet the requirements of this solicitation? 

Answer 3: Offerors may use the FAR reference as guidance.

*** Question 4: For the required 3 past performance references, may the prime contractor use a proposed subcontractor?s past performance for this requirement or do all 3 past performances need to be from the prime contractor?

Answer 4: Three past performance references are required for the prime and for any subcontractor or partner performing a critical element of the work.

 mix proposed by each offeror, or will all labor categories proposed be considered equal in weight?

Answer 4: No, a weighted average will not be used.

***Question 5: How many awards does TSA anticipate as a result of this solicitation?

Answer 5:  To be determined.

***Question 6: Do Resumes count on the Page Limit?

Answer 6: No.

***Question 7: There is conflicting language regarding the Past Performance Surveys and the Past Performance References.  On page 6 of 24 of the RFP, paragraph 1 the language reads for Past Performance:  ?Describe your firm?s relevant past performance on at least three relevant and recent past performance examples of similar scope and size to assess the Offeror?s experience meeting requirements as stated in the SOW.?  Does the government want the Prime describing in Volume 1 Technical Response Section three past performances references of similar scope and size to assess the Prime?s experience in meeting the requirements of the SOW?  Does the government want three past performance Surveys for the three past performances references described above?

Answer 7: Page 6 of 24 of the RFP states, ?To streamline the Government's past performance evaluation process, the offeror shall provide the Past Performance Survey (Attachment 2) to each of the references included in their proposal for completion?.  The Past Performance Surveys are intended to be used by each reference to assess the offeror?s current or prior work with them.  As the SOW details TSA?s requirements rather than the reference?s requirements, the reference is not being asked to assess the offeror?s ability to meet the requirements of the SOW.

*** Question 8: On page 6 of 24 of the RFP, Paragraph 2 the language reads: 
?Please provide company names and a point of contact for each reference listed.?  Please clarify which reference the government was referring. Is it past performance reference or past performance survey cited in page 6 paragraph 1?  Where does the government desire the contact information to be listed?  Is this information duplicative of the information cited for past performance references?

Answer 8: The language refers to past performance references.  The required information for each reference must be provided in the proposal; where that information is provided is at the offeror?s discretion.  The Past Performance Surveys are intended to be used by each reference to assess the offeror?s current or prior work with them. 

*** Question 9: On page 6 of 24 of the RFP, Paragraph 2 the language reads: 
?For any subcontractor or partner performing a critical element of the work, please furnish at least three references for similar projects.? Please clarify the government definition of ?critical elements? of work.  Is there a limitation on the number of references to be submitted in the response?

Answer 9:  ?Critical element? in this case refers to work and/or tasks that are considered non-administrative (filing, copying, typing, etc.).  Additionally, work and/or tasks that, if not performed satisfactorily, would result in failure to meet the requirement.  There is no limit to the number of recent relevant projects that the offeror can include.

***Question 10: On page 6 of 24 of the RFP, Paragraph 2 the language reads:
?For any subcontractor or partner performing a critical element of the work, please furnish at least three references for similar projects?.  How is the government defining ?critical element??  Is this by critical task area (30 surveys 3 per each of the 10 task areas), or by company (3 surveys per company)?  Does this include subs and/or team partners; or do the 3 Surveys needed only apply to the Prime?

Answer 10:  Please see the response to Question 9 above in reference to the term ?critical element?.  Past performance surveys are required for both the prime and subcontractor performing a critical element of the work.

***Question 11: On page 6 of 24 of the RFP, Paragraph 2 the language reads: 
?You should also provide a description of the work performed, the dollar amount and the duration of the project.  Each past performance reference shall include: 1. Company Name, 2. Contract Number, 3. Contract Description, 4. Contract Amount and Type of Contract, 5. Length of the referenced projects, 6. Period of Performance, 7. Retention rate of employees when working on listed projects, 8. Name, address, e-mail address (if available), telephone number, and fax number of the customer, 9. Size and complexity of the project, 10. Whether all options, if applicable, were exercised.  Does the government desire this information to be included in Volume 1 Technical Section or in an appendix?  Is there a limitation on the number of references to be submitted under this requirement?  Does the past performance references apply against the Volume 1 page limitation?

Answer 11: The required information for each reference must be provided in the proposal; where that information is provided is at the offeror?s discretion.  The information for the references is not included in the page limitation.

***Question 12: On page 6 of 24 of the RFP, Paragraph 4 the language reads:
?To streamline the Government?s past performance evaluation process, the offeror shall provide the Past Performance Survey (Attachment 2] to each of the references included in their proposal for completion.?  Is the past performance surveys required only of the Prime/Offeror?s past performance references?  If a Small Business Prime had 4 subs or teaming partners, then the language on this page seems to result in potentially a minimum of 15 references requiring 15 Past Performance Surveys.  Is this the intent of these paragraphs?  Could the language related to subcontractors, partners and the associated Past Performance References and Surveys be clarified or further quantified?

Answer 12:  Please see the responses to Question 9 and 10 above.

***Question 13: There is conflicting language regarding OCI in RFP and SOW.  Section XI of the RFP, page 19, Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI), allows for Contactors and their Subcontractors to address alternate approaches to avoid actual or potential OCIs through the submission of a conflict of interest mitigation plan.  The OCI language in Attachment 1 ? Statement of Work, page 8 of 8 is conflicting in that it states that ?An OCI mitigation plan will not be considered?.  In order to eliminate this conflict, would it be possible to revise the first paragraph of ?Organizational Conflict of Interest?, Attachment 1- Statement of Work (page 8 of 8), to the following: ?This procurement contains a potential OCI.   A Task Order awardee and all subcontractors providing services under that award will not be allowed to compete for any integration or implementation requirement outcomes related to work within that Task Order SOW.  The Contractor shall address any actual or potential OCI in accordance with Article XI of the RFP/BPA??

Answer 13:  Offerors may submit a Mitigation Plan for each resultant task order.  On page 8 of the Statement of Work (Attachment 1 of the RFP), the sentence ?An OCI mitigation plan will not be considered? is hereby replaced with ?An OCI mitigation plan will be considered on an individual basis for each task order?.

***Question 14: Your RFP requests 3 past performance references.  Is this three from each team member, or just three reflective of all team members?

Answer 14:  Please see the response to Question 10.

***Question 15: Reference Volume II, Price Proposal: Does the Government want offerors to propose both government-site and contractor-site labor rates?

Answer 15: Yes.

***Question 16: Reference Volume II, Price Proposal: Does the Government want one rate per labor category or desire proposed rates for each year of the BPA allowing for an annual increase?

Answer 16: Our expectation is rates will be provided for each year of the BPA duration.

***Question 17: Reference Volume I, Past Performance: We are proposing multiple team members.  Does the Government require 3 past performance references from each team member proposed or a minimum of three references for the team (other than the primes references)?

Answer 17:  Please see the responses to Question 9, 10 and 12 above.

***Question 18: In your instructions for submission requirements for Volume 1 ? Past Performance Only, we have interpreted your instructions as requiring three references from each subcontractor as well as the Prime.  Your answer to question # 10 in your January 31st amendment seems to make the inclusion of past performance summaries for teammates within Volume 1 optional.  

Answer 18:  Please see the response to Question 9 above.  Please review Question 10 under the Amendment 1 (posted January 31, 2007).  

***Question 19: Is the inclusion of a Subcontractor?s Past Performance summary within the 15 page technical response a requirement or optional?

Answer 19: Yes.  Past performance reference information is not included in the page count limitation.  

***Question 20: Is it necessary to have a summary with the information designated on page 6 of 24 in the technical response for each Past Performance Survey that is being separately submitted?

Answer 20: Yes.

***Question 21: Could a prime contractor or their subcontractor/team partners awarded this contract participate as a prime contractor or a subcontractor/team partner on TSA?s Integrated Hiring Operations & Personnel (IHOP) Program?  In other words, is any work that will be performed under the SMSS going to restrict companies, due to a conflict of interest, from working on the IHOP Program?

Answer 21: Offerors are expected to review the requirements of any solicitations they plan to propose on and/or any current work with TSA and other DHS components to better anticipate potential conflicts of interest.

***Question 22: The Instructions on page 2 of Attachment 2-Past Performance Survey provide ratings and descriptions of: Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, Unsatisfactory, and Not Applicable (NA).  The corresponding questionnaire (on page 3 and 4) provide column-heading ratings as follows: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Marginal, Unsatisfactory, and NA.  ?Good? may not mean the same as ?Satisfactory? and ?Acceptable? may not mean the same as ?Marginal?.  Will you provide a new survey that will address this discrepancy?  If so, will the due date of the past performance survey be adjusted?

Answer 22: On page 3 and 4 of the Past Performance Survey, please replace the ?Satisfactory? rating with ?Good? and replace the ?Marginal? rating with ?Acceptable?.  A new survey will not be provided.

AMENDMENT 05 TO RFP HSTS03-07-R-ACQ913:  The purpose of this amendment is to publicize responses to questions submitted on February 8, 2007.

***Question 1: The Statement of Work indicates that each TSA program is ordering support services individually, in varying degrees, and using a variety of separate contracts and statements of work.  Please provide the names of the referenced incumbents who are currently supporting TSA.

Answer 1: There is no incumbent for TSA-wide strategic management.  There have been individual contracts for specific programs but the specific contractor names will not be released as many are large businesses that have no bearing as a potential prime contractor on this small business set-aside.

***Question 2: Will U.S. Department of Energy Q and/or L clearances satisfy the evaluation criteria in the RFP Section III.2 to have current security clearances, or the ability to obtain clearances, at the required level immediately upon task order award?

Answer 2: Varying clearance levels at other agencies will satisfy the ability to obtain clearances as an evaluation factor.  Security clearance requirements, if applicable, will vary with each resultant task order.

***Question 3: Regarding the evaluation criteria in the RFP Section III. 5, Past Performance, is there a limit to the number of relevant projects that the offeror can include in the proposal for evaluation?  

Answer 3: There is no limit to the number of recent relevant projects that the offeror can include.

***Question 4: Will TSA use a weighted average to evaluate the proposed price, based on the labortract and who is the service provider of these services? 

Answer 4:  There is not an incumbent.  TSA-wide strategic management is a new endeavor.  There have been individual contracts for specific programs but the specific contractor names will not be released as many are large businesses that have no bearing as a potential prime contractor on this small business set-aside.

***Question 5: Can you describe which areas have requirements for Top Secret and Secret clearances?  

Answer 5: Security clearance requirements will vary with each resultant task order.

*** Question 6: Is it a requirement that the proposed Program Manager for the BPA have a Security Clearance at the time of contract award?  If so, what level and would an interim DOD Secret clearance be acceptable?

Answer 6: The Program Manager for the BPA does not need a clearance.  Security clearance requirements will vary with each resultant task order.

***Question 7: Will all BPA Calls or Task Orders be competed between all BPA awardees or can BPA Calls and Task Orders be directed to a specific BPA holder?  

Answer 7: All BPA Calls/Task Orders will be competed amongst all BPA awardees. Please note that TSA does not guarantee any award of any task order(s).

***Question 8: We plan to have a subcontractor on our team.  As part of the past performance requirements, the Government has requested 3 references for the prime and 3 for any subcontractors.  Due to the limited space requirements, will the government considered excluding past performance references from the page count?

Answer 8: Past performance references will be excluded from the page count limitation.

***Question 9: Reference the SOW Section IV, Volume 1 ? Technical Response and Past Performance, specifically ?Recent past performance?.  Please define ?recent?. Would this be within the past 3 or 5 years?

Answer 9:  Yes, 5 years or less is considered ?recent?.

***Question 10: If a subcontractor is not a major subcontractor, but a specialist, does past performance need to be included for non-major subcontractors?

Answer 10: Past performance is required for any subcontractors or partner performing a critical element of the work.

***Question 11: Is it correct to assume that all Other Direct Costs (ODCs) such as TSA authorized long distance travel and materials will be on a cost-reimbursement basis?

Answer 11: ODCs such as authorized travel will be reimbursed.  We do not anticipate ODCs for materials. Audit approved G&A may be applied to the ODCs.

***Question 12: Please provide us a list of the organizations that requested copies of this RFP.

Answer 12:  This is procurement sensitive information and will not be released.

***Question 13: Does the limit of 15 pages for the technical proposal include the required past performance reference forms to be completed by 3 references?

Answer 13:  The page limitation does not include the Past Performance Survey that will be completed and submitted by the offeror?s reference(s).

***Question 14: Concerning the number of references required for a Subcontractor, reference RFP Section IV, Volume 1, Page 6 of 24 states:  ?For any subcontractor or partner performing a critical element of the work, please furnish at least three references?.  What is the definition of a ?critical element??  Does this have to do with a situation where a subcontractor would be doing most of the work in a certain area?

Answer 14: ?Critical element? in this case refers to work and/or tasks that are considered non-administrative (filing, copying, typing, etc.).  Additionally, work and/or tasks that, if not performed satisfactorily, would result in failure to meet the requirement.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i)entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary ppeaker at this level may hesitate and may have to change subjects due to lack of language resources. Range and control of the language are limited. Speech largely consists of a series of short, discrete utterances.

Examples: The individual is able to satisfy most travel and accommodation needs and a limited range of social demands beyond exchange of skeletal biographic information. Speaking ability may extend beyond immediate survival needs. Accuracy in basic grammatical relations is evident, although not consistent. May exhibit the more common forms of verb tenses, for example, but may make frequent errors in formation and selection. While some structures are established, errors occur in more complex patterns. The individual typically cannot sustain coherent structures in longer utterances or unfamiliar situations. Ability to describe and give precise information is limited. Person, space and time references are often used incorrectly. Pronunciation is understandable to natives used to dealing with foreigners. Can combine most significant sounds with reasonable comprehensibility, but has difficulty in producing certain sounds in certain positions or in certain combinations. Speech will usually be labored. Frequently has to repeat utterances to be understood by the general public. 

Speaking 2 (Limited Working Proficiency) 
Able to satisfy routine social demands and limited work requirements. Can handle routine work-related interactions that are limited in scope. In more complex and sophisticated work-related tasks, language usage generally disturbs the native speaker. Can handle with confidence, but not with facility, most normal, high-frequency social conversational situations including extensive, but casual conversations about current events, as well as work, family, and autobiographical information. The individual can get the gist of most everyday conversations but has some difficulty understanding native speakers in situations that require specialized or sophisticated knowledge. The individual's utterances are minimally cohesive. Linguistic structure is usually not very elaborate and not thoroughly controlled; errors are frequent. Vocabulary use is appropriate for high-frequency utterances, but unusual or imprecise elsewhere.

Examples: While these interactions will vary widely from individual to individual, the individual can typically ask and answer predictable questions in the workplace and give straightforward instructions to subordinates. Additionally, the individual can participate in personal and accommodation-type interactions with elaboration and facility; that is, can give and understand complicated, detailed, and extensive directions and make non-routine changes in travel and accommodation arrangements. Simple structures and basic grammatical relations are typically controlled; however, there are areas of weakness. In the commonly taught languages, these may be simple markings such as plurals, articles, linking words, and negatives or more complex structures such as tense/aspect usage, case morphology, passive constructions, word order, and embedding. 

Speaking 2+ (Limited Working Proficiency, Plus)
Able to satisfy most work requirements with language usage that is often, but not always, acceptable and effective. The individual shows considerable ability to communicate effectively on topics relating to particular interests and special fields of competence. Often shows a high degree of fluency and ease of speech, yet when under tension or pressure, the ability to use the language effectively may deteriorate. Comprehension of normal native speech is typically nearly complete. The individual may miss cultural and local references and may require a native speaker to adjust to his/her limitations in some ways. Native speakers often perceive the individual's speech to contain awkward or inaccurate phrasing of ideas, mistaken time, space and person references, or to be in some way inappropriate, if not strictly incorrect.

Examples: Typically the individual can participate in most social, formal, and informal interactions, but limitations either in range of contexts, types of tasks or level of accuracy hinder effectiveness. The individual may be ill at ease with the use of the language either in social interaction or in speaking at length in professional contexts. He/she is generally strong in either structural precision or vocabulary, but not in both. Weakness or unevenness in one of the foregoing, or in pronunciation, occasionally results in miscommunication. Normally controls, but cannot always easily produce general vocabulary. Discourse is often incohesive. 

Speaking 3 (General Professional Proficiency)
Able to speak the language with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations in practical, social and professional topics. Nevertheless, the individual's limitations generally restrict the professional contexts of language use to matters of shared knowledge and/or international convention. Discourse is cohesive. The individual uses the language acceptably, but with some noticeable imperfections; yet, errors virtually never interfere with understanding and rarely disturb the native speaker. The individual can effectively combine structure and vocabulary to convey his/her meaning accurately. The individual speaks readily and fills pauses suitably. In face-to-face conversation with natives speaking the standard dialect at a normal rate of speech, comprehension is quite complete. Although cultural references, proverbs and the implications of nuances and idiom may not be fully understood, the individual can easily repair the conversation. Pronunciation may be obviously foreign. Individual sounds are accurate: but stress, intonation and pitch control may be faulty.

Examples: Can typically discuss particular interests and special fields of competence with reasonable ease. Can use the language as part of normal professional duties such as answering objections, clarifying points, justifying decisions, understanding the essence of challenges, stating and defending policy, conducting meetings, delivering briefings, or other extended and elaborate informative monologues. Can reliably elicit information and informed opinion from native speakers. Structural inaccuracy is rarely the major cause of misunderstanding. Use of structural devices is flexible and elaborate. Without searching for words or phrases, the individual uses the language clearly and relatively naturally to elaborate concepts freely and make ideas easily understandable to native speakers. Errors occur in low-frequency and highly complex structures. 

Speaking 3+ (General Professional Proficiency, Plus)
Is often able to use the language to satisfy professional needs in a wide range of sophisticated and demanding tasks.

Examples: Despite obvious strengths, may exhibit some hesitancy, uncertainty, effort or errors which limit the range of language-use tasks that can be reliably performed. Typically there is particular strength in fluency and one or more, but not all, of the following: breadth of lexicon, including low- and medium-frequency items, especially socio-linguistic/cultural references and nuances of close synonyms; structural precision, with sophisticated features that are readily, accurately and appropriately controlled (such as complex modification and embedding in Indo-European languages); discourse competence in a wide range of contexts and tasks, often matching a native speaker's strategic and organizational abilities and expectations. Occasional patterned errors occur in low frequency and highly-complex structures. 

Speaking 4 (Advanced Professional Proficiency)
Able to use the language fluently and accurately on all levels normally pertinent to professional needs. The individual's language usage and ability to function are fully successful. Organizes discourse well, using appropriate rhetorical speech devices, native cultural references and understanding. Language ability only rarely hinders him/her in performing any task requiring language; yet, the individual would seldom be perceived as a native. Speaks effortlessly and smoothly and is able to use the language with a high degree of effectiveness, reliability and precision for all representational purposes within the range of personal and professional experience and scope of responsibilities. Can serve as in informal interpreter in a range of unpredictable circumstances. Can perform extensive, sophisticated language tasks, encompassing most matters of interest to well-educated native speakers, including tasks which do not bear directly on a professional specialty.

Examples: Can discuss in detail concepts which are fundamentally different from those of the target culture and make those concepts clear and accessible to the native speaker. Similarly, the individual can understand the details and ramifications of concepts that are culturally or conceptually different from his/her own. Can set the tone of interpersonal official, semi-official and non-professional verbal exchanges with a representative range of native speakers (in a range of varied audiences, purposes, tasks and settings). Can play an effective role among native speakers in such contexts as conferences, lectures and debates on matters of disagreement. Can advocate a position at length, both formally and in chance encounters, using sophisticated verbal strategies. Understands and reliably produces shifts of both subject matter and tone. Can understand native speakers of the standard and other major dialects in essentially any face-to-face interaction. 

Speaking 4+ (Advanced Professional Proficiency, Plus)
Speaking proficiency is regularly superior in all respects, usually equivalent to that of a well educated, highly articulate native speaker. Language ability does not impede the performance of any language-use task. However, the individual would not necessarily be perceived as culturally native.

Examples: The individual organizes discourse well, employing functional rhetorical speech devices, native cultural references and understanding. Effectively applies a native speaker's social and circumstantial knowledge; however, cannot sustain that performance under all circumstances. While the individual has a wide range and control of structure, an occasional nonnative slip may occur. The individual has a sophisticated control of vocabulary and phrasing that is rarely imprecise, yet there are occasional weaknesses in idioms, colloquialisms, pronunciation, and cultural reference or there may be an occasional failure to interact in a totally native manner. 

Speaking 5 (Functionally Native Proficiency)
Speaking proficiency is functionally equivalent to that of a highly articulate well-educated native speaker and reflects the cultural standards of the country where the language is natively spoken. The individual uses the language with complete flexibility and intuition, so that speech on all levels is fully accepted by well-educated native speakers in all of its features, including breadth of vocabulary and idiom, colloquialisms and pertinent cultural references. Pronunciation is typically consistent with that of well-educated native speakers of a non-stigmatized dialect. 


WRITING:
Writing 0 (No Proficiency)
No functional writing ability. 

Writing 0+ (Memorized Proficiency)
Writes using memorized material and set expressions. Can produce symbols in an alphabetic or syllabic writing system or 50 of the most common characters. Can write numbers and dates, own name, nationality, address, etc., such as on a hotel registration form. Otherwise, ability to write is limited to simple lists of common items such as a few short sentences. Spelling and even representation of symbols (letters, syllables, and characters) may be incorrect. 

Writing 1 (Elementary Proficiency)
Has sufficient control of the writing system to meet limited practical needs. Can create by writing statements and questions on topics very familiar to him/her within the scope of his/her very limited language experience. Writing vocabulary is inadequate to express anything but elementary needs; writes in simple sentences making continual errors in spelling, grammar and punctuation but writing can be read and understood by a native reader used to dealing with foreigners attempting to write his/her language. Writing tends to be a loose collection of sentences (or fragments) on a given topic and provides little evidence of conscious organization. While topics which are "very familiar" and elementary needs vary considerably from individual to individual, any person at this level should be able to write simple phone messages, excuses, notes to service people and simple notes to friends. 

Writing 1+ (Elementary Proficiency, Plus)
Sufficient control of writing system to meet most survival needs and limited social demands. Can create sentences and short paragraphs related to most survival needs (food, lodging, transportation, immediate surroundings and situations) and limited social demands. Can express fairly accurate present and future time. Can produce some past verb forms but not always accurately or with correct usage. Can relate personal history, discuss topics such as daily life, preferences and very familiar material. Shows good control of elementary vocabulary and some control of basic syntactic patterns but major errors still occur when expressing more complex thoughts. Dictionary usage may still yield incorrect vocabulary or terms, although the individual can use a dictionary to advantage to express simple ideas. Generally cannot use basic cohesive elements of discourse to advantage (such as relative constructions, object pronouns, connectors, etc.). Can take notes in some detail on familiar topics, and respond to personal questions using elementary vocabulary and common structures. Can write simple letters, summaries of biographical data and work experience with fair accuracy. Writing, though faulty, is comprehensible to native speakers used to dealing with foreigners. 

Writing 2 (Limited Working Proficiency) 
Able to write routine social correspondence and prepare documentary materials required for most limited work requirements. Has writing vocabulary sufficient to express himself/herself simply with some circumlocutions. Can write simply about a very limited number of current events or daily situations. Still makes common errors in spelling and punctuation, but shows some control of the most common formats and punctuation conventions. Good control of morphology of language (in inflected languages) and of the most frequently used syntactic structures. Elementary constructions are usually handled quite accurately and writing is understandable to a native reader not used to reading the writing of foreigners. Uses a limited number of cohesive devices. 

Writing 2+ (Limited Working Proficiency, Plus)
Shows ability to write with some precision and in some detail about most common topics. Can write about concrete topics relating to particular interests and special fields of competence. Often shows surprising fluency and ease of expression but under time constraints and pressure language may be inaccurate and/or incomprehensible. Generally strong in either grammar or vocabulary but not in both. Weaknesses or unevenness in one of the foregoing or in spelling result in occasional miscommunication. Areas of weakness range from simple constructions such as plurals, articles, prepositions and negatives to more complex structures such as tense usage, passive constructions, word order and relative clauses. Normally controls general vocabulary with some misuse of everyday vocabulary evident. Shows a limited ability to use circumlocutions Uses dictionary to advantage to supply unknown words. Can take fairly accurate notes on material presented orally and handle with fair accuracy most social correspondence. Writing is understandable to native speakers not used to dealing with foreigners' attempts to write the language, though style is still obviously foreign. 

Writing 3 (General Professional Proficiency)
Able to use the language effectively in most formal and informal written exchanges on practical, social and professional topics. Can write reports, summaries, and short library research papers on current events, on particular areas of interest or on special fields with reasonable ease. Control of structure, spelling and general vocabulary is adequate to convey his/her message accurately but style may be obviously foreign. Errors virtually never interfere with comprehension and rarely disturb the native reader. Punctuation generally controlled. Employs a full range of structures. Control of grammar good with only sporadic errors in basic structures, occasional errors in the most complex frequent structures and somewhat more frequent errors in low frequency complex structures. Consistent control of compound and complex sentences. Relationship of ideas is consistently clear. 

Writing 3+ (General Professional Proficiency, Plus)
Able to write the language in a few prose styles pertinent to professional/educational needs. Not always able to tailor language to suit audience. Weaknesses may be in poor control of low frequency complex structures, vocabulary or the ability to express subtleties, and nuances. May be able to write on some topics pertinent to professional/educational needs. Organization may suffer due to lack of variety in organizational patterns or in variety of cohesive devices. 

Writing 4 (Advanced Professional Proficiency)
Able to write the language precisely and accurately in a variety of prose styles pertinent to professional/educational needs. Errors of grammar are rare including those in low frequency complex structures. Consistently able to tailor language to suit audience and able to express subtleties and nuances. Expository prose is clearly, consistently and explicitly organized. The writer employs a variety of organizational patterns, uses a wide variety of cohesive devices such as ellipses and parallelisms, and subordinates in a variety of ways. Able to write on all topics normally pertinent to professional and educational needs and on social issues of a general nature. Writing adequate to express all his/her experiences. 

Writing 4+ (Advanced Professional Proficiency, Plus)
Able to write the language precisely and accurately in a wide variety of prose styles pertinent to professional/educational needs. May have some ability to edit but not in the full range of styles. Has some flexibility within a style and shows some evidence of a use of stylistic devices. 

Writing 5 (Functionally Native Proficiency)
Has writing proficiency equal to that of a well educated native. Without non-native errors of structure, spelling, style or vocabulary can write and edit both formal and informal correspondence, official reports and documents, and professional/ educational articles including writing for special purposes which might include legal, technical, educational, literary and colloquial writing. In addition to being clear, explicit and informative, the writing and the ideas are also imaginative. The writer employs a very wide range of stylistic devices.

ATTACHMENT 3
INTERAGENCY LANGUAGE ROUNDTABLE LANGUAGE SKILL LEVEL DESCRIPTIONS

SPEAKING:
Speaking 0 (No Proficiency)
Unable to function in the spoken language. Oral production is limited to occasional isolated words. Has essentially no communicative ability. 

Speaking 0+ (Memorized Proficiency)
Able to satisfy immediate needs using rehearsed utterances. Shows little real autonomy of expression, flexibility or spontaneity. Can ask questions or make statements with reasonable accuracy only with memorized utterances or formulae. Attempts at creating speech are usually unsuccessful.

Examples: The individual's vocabulary is usually limited to areas of immediate survival needs. Most utterances are telegraphic; that is, functors (linking words, markers and the like) are omitted, confused or distorted. An individual can usually differentiate most significant sounds when produced in isolation but, when combined in words or groups of words, errors may be frequent. Even with repetition, communication is severely limited even with people used to dealing with foreigners. Stress, intonation, tone, etc. are usually quite faulty. 

Speaking 1 (Elementary Proficiency)
Able to satisfy minimum courtesy requirements and maintain very simple face-to-face conversations on familiar topics. A native speaker must often use slowed speech, repetition, paraphrase, or a combination of these to be understood by this individual. Similarly, the native speaker must strain and employ real-world knowledge to understand even simple statements/questions from this individual. This speaker has a functional, but limited proficiency. Misunderstandings are frequent, but the individual is able to ask for help and to verify comprehension of native speech in face-to-face interaction. The individual is unable to produce continuous discourse except with rehearsed material.

Examples: Structural accuracy is likely to be random or severely limited. Time concepts are vague. Vocabulary is inaccurate, and its range is very narrow. The individual often speaks with great difficulty. By repeating, such speakers can make themselves understood to native speakers who are in regular contact with foreigners but there is little precision in the information conveyed. Needs, experience or training may vary greatly from individual to individual; for example, speakers at this level may have encountered quite different vocabulary areas. However, the individual can typically satisfy predictable, simple, personal and accommodation needs; can generally meet courtesy, introduction, and identification requirements; exchange greetings; elicit and provide, for example, predictable and skeletal biographical information. He/she might give information about business hours; explain routine procedures in a limited way and state in a simple manner what actions will be taken. He/she is able to formulate some questions even in languages with complicated question constructions. Almost every utterance may be characterized by structural errors and errors in basic grammatical relations. Vocabulary is extremely limited and characteristically does not include modifiers. Pronunciation, stress, and intonation are generally poor, often heavily influenced by another language. Use of structure and vocabulary is highly imprecise. 

Speaking 1+ (Elementary Proficiency, Plus)
Can initiate and maintain predictable face-to-face conversations and satisfy limited social demands. He/she may, however, have little understanding of the social conventions of conversation. The interlocutor is generally required to strain and employ real-world knowledge to understand even some simple speech. The sayer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ATTACHMENT 2

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9 Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12). HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems. USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems. USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007. (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007. In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo. One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.) USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer. Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems. All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing. The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures. This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.
