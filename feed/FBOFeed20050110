<SUBJECT>A -- Micro Cryogenic Coolers (MCC)
<SOLNBR>BAA05-15
<RESPDATE>040805
<ARCHDATE>01102006
<CONTACT>Clark Nguyen, Program Manager, MTO, Phone 5712184586, Fax 7036962206, Email cnguyen@darpa.mil
<DESC>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Micro Cryogenic Coolers (MCC). The proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state-of-practice.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the area of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) implementations of MCC, with the ultimate objective being the realization of micro-scale devices and sub-systems with unprecedented performance, attained via micro-scale targeted cryogenic cooling of only the needed volume/device to reduce both the size and power consumption required for cooling. By harnessing the advantages of micro-scale miniaturization, the MCC program is expected to yield tiny, targeted cryogenic cooling systems capable of:

(1)	heat loads only a small fraction of that presented by non-targeted approaches, with ultimate heat load values from 10’s of microwatts to a few milliwatts, depending upon the chosen device application;
(2)	cooling time constants from nanoseconds to microseconds, where needed, and depending upon the requirements of the chosen device application;
(3)	cooling mechanism power consumption less than 100 mW (the smaller the better, and less than 10mW should be possible for some applications);
(4)	cooler heat lift greater than 10 mW;
(5)	cooling to 160K or lower, depending upon the requirements of the chosen application;
(6)	overall sub-systems size less than 4 cc, not including power source, but including control electronics and any required device packaging;
(7)	a substantial increase in DoD-relevant application performance (e.g., LNA noise figure less than 0.1dB, resonator Q greater than 1,000,000, IR detector array sensitivity improved by 10x, gyro bias stability improved to surpass navigation-grade requirements, etc.) or outright enabling of DoD-relevant applications (e.g., quenched freezing of tiny bio-samples, etc.); and
(8)	maintaining cryogenically-attained superior performance over a -40 degrees C to 85 degrees C temperature range.

Note that the above are merely meant to provide rough order of magnitude expectations of what is ultimately deemed possible by the end of the MCC program, and are not to be construed as rigid program specifications.

MCC realizations that utilize MEMS-based technologies to isolate the specific device(s) that need cryogenic cooling into sizes of 100’s of microns or less are of particular interest, since it is expected that micro-scale miniaturization to reduce radiation and conduction losses will be instrumental in sufficiently reducing heat loads to values that  allow coolers with very small heat lifts. Among the isolation technologies, approaches, and activities, expected to be beneficial in this endeavor are: (1) identification/development of micromachinable materials that possess the needed material properties (e.g., emissivities, thermal conductivities, elastic constants, etc.) at cryogenic temperatures; (2) micro-scale ultra-high vacuum encapsulation; (3) micro-platforms on which the specific devices to be cooled are mounted or directly integrated upon, that are small enough to allow long thin supports with enormous thermal resistances, and tiny total surface areas for minimal radiation loss; (4) advanced shielding techniques to minimize thermal loss (e.g., photonic bandgap structures, nano-gaps, etc.); (5) staged isolation structures (e.g., double or triple isolations) to mitigate thermal loss mechanisms that exhibit nonlinear temperature dependencies; and (6) for arrayed applications, balancing of large and small thermal resistances and capacitances to allow extremely fast cooling time constants.

Miniature cryogenic coolers, of course, are also of great interest to the MCC program. Given that MCC heat loads should be many times smaller than seen in typical macroscopic cryogenic systems, the micro-scale cooling mechanisms required for MCC will likely not require large heat lift capabilities. This might help to offset potential cooling efficiency losses in some cooling approaches (e.g., due to detrimental surface-to-volume increases with miniaturization). Note, however, that cooling efficiency might not be the most important consideration in a given application; rather, the total power and size required for cooling is of higher importance to the MCC program. As such, if the heat load presented by a properly isolated device is made low enough via the aforementioned MEMS-based isolation technology, then the efficiency of the cooler need not be high as long as the overall power required to cool is small enough (e.g., less than 30mW) to allow portable operation for lengthy periods. This is not to say that efficiency is not important; for applications where the heat load remains significant, even after measures are taken to target the cooling, cooler efficiency will obviously still be very important. In addition, solutions that achieve the minimal power consumption will likely be the most attractive as long as their size is also small. In this respect, a power-size product might comprise a good metric with which to gauge the efficacy of a given approach. Whatever the metric used, the simultaneous emphasis on power consumption and size by the MCC program, together with its ability to reduce heat loads for various applications, greatly expands the set of usable cooling technologies, to the point where historically inefficient methods might actually become the most effective on the proposed micro-scale. Among the cooling approaches expected to be amenable to MCC implementation are: (1) mechanical cooling approaches (e.g., using compressors, heat exchangers, Joule-Thompson plugs, etc.); (2) thermoelectric coolers, perhaps embedded in the aforementioned isolation structures; and (3) laser cooling approaches that might be most amenable to arrayed applications. Possible research activities pursuant to micro-cryogenic cooler implementation might include: (1) implementation of effective and reliable micro-scale valves, heat exchangers, plugs, and expansion chambers; (2) realization of tiny, efficient, low-power compressors, perhaps using radically different approaches than used at the macro-scale; (3) isolation strategies for cooler structures and mechanisms; (4) implementation of micro-scale heat sinks; (5) thermoelectric cooler stacking (or staging) at the micro-scale, and incorporation into isolation structures; (5) development of micromachinable, energy-absorbent materials for laser cooling; (6) development of methods for efficiently removing heat carrying photons from isolated structures in laser cooled systems; and (7) demonstration of methods for sequenced distribution (i.e., raster scanning) of cooling for arrayed applications.

Perhaps the most compelling driver behind the MCC program is the continuing need for the highest performance in DoD systems, and the fact that cryogenic cooling has long been used to substantially increase the performance of systems important to the DoD. Among the applications that greatly benefit from operation at cryogenic temperatures are: cooled IR detectors for heat seeking missiles and night vision; low noise amplifiers (LNA’s) for ultra-sensitive, long-range communications, such as needed for deep space applications; front-end passives in communication systems, again, for ultra-sensitive communications; a myriad of sensors that have substantially lower noise floors and improved stability when operated at cryogenic temperatures, including and especially sensors for inertial navigation; and next generation nano-scale devices, such as atom optical inertial sensors and timing references, single electron transistors, bio-sampling devices, and other nano-applications that operate best at cryogenic temperatures. 

Despite substantially higher performance levels provided by cryogenic cooling, an increasing number of DoD systems are exploring alternative methods that allow operation without the need for cryogenic cooling, mainly to circumvent its rather large size and power requirements. Unfortunately, the performance compromise imposed by uncooled renditions of originally cooled applications (e.g., uncooled IR detectors) often leaves users wanting in numerous applications. As a consequence, a cryogenic cooling system that could be realized in a small size while consuming very little power is highly desirable.

MEMS technology presents an opportunity to provide such a cooling system for a subset of applications where the performance of a single device or a single circuit determines the overall performance of a much larger system. For example, the noise figure (i.e., sensitivity) of a communication receiver is often determined largely by the noise generated from the input transistor of its low-noise amplifier (LNA). As another example, the resolution of a vibratory gyroscope is often governed by either the Brownian noise in its proof mass or by the noise generated by the input device of its sense amplifier; and its bias stability is often governed by the Q of its resonator element. In both of these cases, front-end noise can be reduced by merely operating the critical device (i.e., the single transistor, or the single resonant proof mass) at a much lower, preferably cryogenic, temperature. Furthermore, again in both cases, only a tiny area need actually be cooled to cryogenic temperatures to affect significant performance advantages; the rest of the system can function at ambient temperature. Methods for selective cooling of elements within an array (e.g., for IR detection) may also be feasible.
		
Given the above, and given the need for smaller sizes and longer battery lifetimes in portable military systems, a micro-cryogenic cooler (MCC) capable of achieving cryogenic temperatures over a targeted, micro-scale volume (e.g., just enough to encompass a single 2 microns x 2 microns transistor) using only milliwatts of power, would be highly desirable. Such a capability could greatly extend the range of military sensors and communication devices without compromising the size or battery lifetimes of portable units.

DARPA strongly encourages well-coordinated, interdisciplinary research and development activities that take into consideration all significant and relevant engineering tradeoffs and optimizations. Teaming among academic, industrial and/or government partners is encouraged, and it is anticipated that the contributions of the team members are complementary as well as essential to the critical path of the research plan. A technology insertion plan is encouraged and research that holds promise of insertion into Department of Defense (DoD) relevance is of great interest.


PROGRAM SCOPE

The Micro Cryogenic Coolers (MCC) program will consist of a Phase I effort (e.g., 18 months) followed by an optional Phase II (e.g., 18 months), and finally a Phase III (e.g., 18 months) for those efforts that appear to have the greatest potential for production, insertion, transition or overall benefit to the DoD. Awards are expected to be made during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005. Organizations wishing to participate in Phase II and Phase III should include them as options in their proposal (separate options for each phase). Multiple awards are anticipated.  The formation of multi-disciplinary teams consisting of industry, academia, and/or national laboratories with complementary areas of expertise is strongly encouraged, especially given the sub-system flavor of the MGA program. A web site—http://teaming.sysplan.com/BAA-05-15/ has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion, but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  Questions concerning this BAA may be directed to the technical POC for this effort, Dr. Clark T.-C. Nguyen, phone: (571) 218-4586, fax: (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: cnguyen@darpa.mil

<CONTACT>Mark Ross 850-235-5624 , or Contracting Officer Tammy Bair at 850-636-6115.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC)  intends to award a sole source,  indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC), 6900 Main Street, Stratford, Connecticut, for engineering services in support of the modification of the MH-60 helicopter to incorporate Airborne Mine CounterMeasures (AMCM) capabilities.  The overall purpose of this effort is to: 1)Develop modifications for the tow coupler in the MH-60 Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) 2)Develop, test, and evaluate the tow coupler AFCS modification 3)Develop Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) to incorporate AMCM capabilities into production aircraft, both forward fit and retrofit 4)Develop, test, evaluate, and deliver AMCM production hardware and software 5)Provide aircraft test pilots, ground maintenance crew, maintenance and flight test hours to conduct testing and evaluations 6)Identify and purchase aircraft instrumentation required for testing 7)Provide engineering, technical, and support services in support of AMCM system development, integration and testing This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons: SAC is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the MH-60 helicopter and is the only source of these helicopters.  As such, only SAC has the expertise, technical data, equipment and experienced personnel to successfully and safely modify and flight test the aircraft in a new configuration as well as develop the production level design changes to forward fit and retrofit the MH-60 aircraft with the AMCM capability.  This is a follow-on contract to N61331-00-D-0028 for the acquisition of engineering services for continued development of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  There are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement wi! thout significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The National Council on Disability (NCD) has begun an assertive and systematic review of both public and private policies and initiatives aimed at improving the employment of people with disabilities. A primary building block in the sequential but complementary studies on employment is NCD’s currently underway Social Security/Transitioning to Work Study, examining the evidence-based practices that promote the return to work (and transition to work) of working age beneficiaries of the DI and SSI programs. The next building block will be this employment study, which will include the following major components: a) a thorough, systematic examination or “environmental scan” of the nexus between employment and the following areas:  transportation; housing; reasonable accommodations; education; health care; assistive technology; telecommunications; long-term services and supports, and telecommuting, among other topics; b)  the establishment of a business advisory committee and the conduction of public forums to solicit information and input on employment issues and practices; c) the development of informational issue briefs that examine the status and impact of existing employment strategies at the federal, state and local level, such as customized employment, entrepreneurship, telework, supported employment, microbusiness, e-commerce, and competitive employment; and d) a cohesive final report with information drawn from the environmental scan, business advisory committee, public forums and informational briefs along with recommendations aimed at improving the employment status of people with disabilities. This employment study will be conducted at the same time that NCD undertakes a complementary research initiative on financial incentives available to enhance the ability of people with disabilities to live and work independently and in the community of their choice.  The estimated contract period is 12 months.  NCD will distribute its Employment Study Request for Proposals (RFP) to interested parties on February 4, 2005.  NCD will expect interested parties to submit their responses by March 22, 2005.  Copies of the RFP may be requested by mail or picked up on or after the issue date of February 4, 2005.  All requests must reference the RFP number and title.  For more information, contact Joan Durocher, 1331 F Street, N.W., Suite 850, Washington, D.C. 20004, jdurocher@ncd.gov.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole-source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1 and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the Kennedy Institute of Ethics (KIE), Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., a five year contract, "Support of the National Reference Center for Bioethics Literature Library as a Complementary Resource to the National Library of Medicine AND the Identification, Creation and Maintenance of Bioethics Records for the National Library of Medicine."  This contract will merge two previous NLM contracts: one which supported the activities of the National Reference Center for Bioethics Literature (NRCBL) and the second which provided for the continued identification, organization and dissemination of bibliographic data related to the field of bioethics for the National Library of Medicine databases. Both previous contracts were awarded to KIE, Georgetown University, on a sole source basis. Under this new contract the KIE will provide collection development, library and outreach services in the field of bioethics, as well as being responsible for the acquisition and indexing of bioethics-related books, journal articles, reports and other items for the NLM databases or for the NRCBL, which will serve as a complementary resource to NLM.  Because many of the publications are not totally bioethics-oriented, skill is needed to determine those publications that warrant inclusion in the systems.  This requires knowledge of the original BIOETHICSLINE database's scope and coverage, trends and issues in the field of bioethics, and familiarity with NLM's software systems used to create database records.  Since the early 1970’s the Kennedy Institute has successfully acquired and indexed references to bioethics material.  They also actively make recommendations for MeSH (NLM’s controlled medical vocabulary).  The Kennedy Institute owns the rights to the data produced under the BIOETHICSLINE database during the period 1974 through 1987.  In addition the Kennedy Institute keeps on file a hard copy of each indexed citation, which is required for the interlibrary loan program.   The KIE bioethics library was established by Georgetown University in 1973.  In 1985 when Congress asked NLM to establish a National Reference Center for Bioethics Literature (NRCBL), KIE, under Georgetown University, was awarded the grant to do that work after a competitive review process and NLM has funded it ever since.  The NCRBL has developed a unique specialized collection that is multidisciplinary in scope and coverage and serves as a major national resource for bioethics.  Due to the fact that the Kennedy Institute houses and owns a portion of the NRCBL collection and owns the rights to a substantial portion of the data produced makes them the only firm capable of fulfilling NLM's requirements without undue delays and duplication of effort. It has been determined that the Kennedy Institute is the only source with the necessary materials for running the NRCBL and the expertise for selecting the appropriate data to be added and maintained in NLM data systems according to a defined bioethics subject scope without duplication of effort.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

One of the PRB areas of emphasis is assessment of the prevalence and determinants of health behavior among adolescents.  Toward this end the PRB plans to conduct a national school-based probability survey of U.S. 6th-10th graders that is also consistent with the requirements of the international Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey.  The HBSC survey is conducted among national or regional samples of students at ages 11, 13, and 15 years of age in about 35 countries.   The goal of the HBSC survey is to obtain data about adolescent health behavior and to make this information available so as to enable the improvement of health services and programs for youth. The goals of the U.S. survey are to provide health behavior information about adolescents nationally (U.S.-specific protocol) and to enable international comparisons by incorporating the mandatory HBSC protocol.  A survey consistent with the HBSC was conducted in the U.S. previously in 1997-1998 and 2001-2002.  In international comparisons, previous HBSC surveys showed that U.S. 15-year-old youth are less likely to smoke than students in most other countries surveyed, even though 13-year-old U.S. students experiment with tobacco in comparable proportions to youth in other countries.  The most recent survey demonstrated that U.S. youth are more likely to be overweight than students in the other HBSC countries.  U.S. eating habits were also shown to be less healthy with a comparatively high proportion of youth consuming high fat foods and soft drinks with sugar.  Analyses of the U.S. national data set have addressed bullying, unintentional injury, and utilization of health care.  The U.S. survey shall be conducted during the 2005-2006 school year and will address health-related factors according to rigorous protocols developed by the HBSC (to made available by June of 2005), and should also include additional factors and dimensions that are relevant to the U.S. experience.  The nationally-representative probability sample for the school-based survey requires a minimum of 1536 students/age group with mean ages 11.5, 13.5, and 15.5 and a total of 5000 students with confidence intervals of 95% +/- 3% and a design factor of 1.2.   Over-sampling of racial minorities shall be required.  This is a time-sensitive requirement and will require a national network of data collectors.  Request For Proposal (RFP) RFP-NICHD-2005-08 will be available electronically on the FedBizOpps website at http://www1.eps.gov/spg/HHS/NIH (under National Institute of Child Health and Human Development) on or about January 26, 2005, and the proposals shall be due 30 days after the release of the RFP on or about February 25, 2005.  The NICHD does not intend to release hard copies of the RFP.  All responsible parties may submit a proposal which shall be considered for contract award.   The Government reserves the right to cancel the requirement at any time prior to contract award.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009; PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Mr. Ezekiel K. Saina, Ag. Senior Deputy Commissioner, Management Information Services, Kenya Revenue Authority, Times Tower Building, 27th Floor, Haile Selassie Avenue, P.O. Box 48240 00100, Nairobi, Kenya  Phone: +254-20-310900, Fax: +254-20-318071,  Email: Ezekiel.saina@kra.go.ke.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance to the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) for their Integrated Tax System Project.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) recently signed a $344,000 feasibility study and technical assistance grant with the KRA to investigate creating a computerized national integrated tax system.  KRA plans to implement a computerized system that would modernize revenue administration in order to enhance and streamline revenue collection and administration.  Improved tax collection will allow KRA to achieve its objectives of improving services to the public, delivering its program to government, and reducing administrative overhead costs.  This study would assist KRA with developing a framework to meet these needs.

KRA’s current information systems were designed and implemented in the early 1990s, when the three main revenue departments were part of the Ministry of Finance and Planning.  When KRA was established as an independent authority, it inherited the existing computer systems to support business operations in its income tax, value-added tax, and customs and excise divisions.  These systems are not integrated among the departments, and are inefficient for processing, use of personnel, and in their synthesis of information.

The proposed integrated tax system would seek to achieve the following:
1) Maintain information on all tax-related transactions for Kenyan citizens through the use of a common personal identification number (PIN);
2) Provide an avenue for consolidating information from various sources in KRA; and
3) Provide a single source of vital information regarding trading and income information for corporate and individual taxpayers. 

The following are a summary of the tasks that comprise the scope of the Technical Assistance:

Task 1: Information review and business process improvement analysis;
Task 2: Requirements definition for procedures, regulations, ICT infrastructure, and all other relevant components;
Task 3: Development of a plan for software, network infrastructure and hardware procurement, and an implementation strategy, including a cost comparison, an implementation plan for donors, and a list of possible financing sources;
Task 4: Development of a KRA information and communication technology (ICT) framework;
Task 5: Legal and regulatory analysis; and
Task 6: Final Report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $344,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM (Local Time), February 25, 2005, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Government intends to issue a sole source modification to AT&T Communications, Government Solutions, 1900 Gallows Road, Vienna, VA 22182.  The proposed modification is a continuation and extension of work performed by AT&T under contract DCA200-97-D-0054 that was competitively awarded in February 1997.  This contract requires AT&T to provide network and hub operations for DISN Video Services (DVS).  A follow-on competition is in process and the anticipated award is March 2006 with full opertional capability by March 2007.   This modification provides a continuation of support through February 2007 providing for implementation of the DVS II contract.  AT&T owns and operates all the equipment and proprietary software for the existing DISN Video Services under the DVS-G contract.  The Network Operations Center is located in an AT&T facility in Dranesville, VA.  The government is unable to turn operations over to another vendor since they do not own any of the equipment.  AT&T is the only vendor to incorporate both dial-up and dedicated Video Teleconference Facilities (VTFs) and provide classified support at the level of security required in the time frame available.  To maintain operational readiness and continuous capability to perform its primary mission, DOD cannot afford any disruption of DVS-G services.  AT&T provides this secure service at a reliability of 99.6% on dedicated transmission links.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.   See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>I.	INTRODUCTION 
Bechtel, BWXT Idaho LLC (BBWI), Management & Operating Contractor of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory [as of February 1, 2005 the INEEL will become the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) operated by Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA)], is requesting an EOI from prospective vendors to provide one or more of the following: conceptual design, detailed design, safety analysis, and fabrication services for a new gas test loop installed in a nuclear test reactor for fast flux irradiation of materials and fuels. This EOI serves as a method of screening potential vendors; allowing only qualified candidates to receive a formal Request For Proposal (RFP).

II.	BACKGROUND 
The INL is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratory located approximately 50 miles from Idaho Falls, Idaho.  The INL is seeking one or more subcontractors to provide engineering, scientific, nuclear fuel design and qualification, and safety analysis services to support the design  and installation of a gas test loop in the Advanced Test Reactor.  Design activities will take place during Fiscal Years 2005 and 2006.  

III.	PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 
Information is sought to identify prospective vendors with the capabilities to provide the required services.  Scope includes providing equipment, trained personnel, procedures and materials as necessary to support the design and installation of a gas test loop. 

IV.	SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS
It is the intent of this EOI to identify candidate vendors who have previous experience in providing similar services.  Prospective vendors shall provide:

1)	A description of current capabilities and experience in reactor engineering, nuclear fuel design and qualification, safety analysis, neutronics, and thermo-hydraulics related to nuclear reactor loop designs.
2)	A minimum of one reference who represents a direct client of the vendor to validate past similar experience.
3)	A copy of  the vendor’s Safety Program along with the most recent three years of accident/injury statistics. 
4)	Information on familiarity with and/or qualifications as an NQA-1 qualified supplier.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

SECTION L – INSTRUCTIONS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES TO OFFERORS OR RESPONDENTS

SECTION L is Attachment 2

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  The NAVAIDS need to be compatible in performance and data protocol with CLIN 0001 through 0007. A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made. Meeting the schedule requirements is one of main the determining factors for contact award. For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as schedule, place of delivery, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.

            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the Schedule of Supplies.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”. The equipment needs to be standardized across the system for logistical, training, spare parts requirements and to enable it to be able to transmit data back to the ACC in Baghdad.  Installation of the NAVAIDs requires that these systems be compatible in performance and data protocol to the systems at Baghdad.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.  If an offeror, or the proposed key employees of the offeror, do not have a past performance history deemed relevant to this solicitation, the offeror will receive a neutral confidence rating.  The neutral confidence rating will be considered in the overall assessment for a best value decision.

	(iv) An overall confidence assessment rating will be made.  The following confidence assessment ratings apply:

Rating				Definition

Blue  			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
exceptional/high confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Green 		Based on the offerors record of performance there is very
good/significant confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Yellow		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
satisfactory/confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Grey			Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
neutral/unknown confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Black		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is
marginal/little confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Red			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
unsatisfactory/no confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

(3)  Price.  

 	    (a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a)(1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	
              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<DESC>This is an update to the synopsis/Request For Information entitled "VIRTUAL" SPACE ACADEMY that was posted on August 19, 2004. The August synopsis requested comments and ideas from all sources related to recommendations from the President's Commission on Implementation of U.S. Space Exploration Policy. The Commission’s report can be found at: http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/60736main_M2M_report_small.pdf  Specifically, the Commission has recommended that the federal government:  - increase the priority of teacher training - provide for better integration of existing math, science, and engineering education initiatives across governments, industries, and professional organizations  - explore options to create a university-based space academy for training the next generation technical work force  In addition, the original RFI contemplated a possible Space Exploration Policy Institute. NASA received numerous responses to the August RFI and has since drafted a preliminary Statement of Work to identify the specific requirements that may be needed. This Preliminary Statement of Work is being released as part of this synopsis update. NASA is considering issuing a Request for Proposals related to this requirement in the next 60-90 days, with a probable single contract award no later than Spring of 2005. NASA anticipates that a pre-proposal conference will be held within one week of RFP release. Potential offerors are invited to review this preliminary SOW and provide questions and comments to the Primary Point of Contact via e-mail by January 24, 2005. The Primary Point of Contact is Karen Smith. Comments should be submitted via email to Karen.M.Smith@nasa.gov. Responses shall include an executive summary and shall be limited to no more than 20 pages.  In addition to general comments, NASA would like comments/feedback on the following items: -	Schedule/Length of contract - How long to put together this model? -	Contract type – NASA is currently contemplating a fixed price contract. -	Challenges associated with the scope of work including partnerships -	Potential cost including the variables that impact cost -	NASA is also seeking ideas on establishing an institute for the study of space exploration policy. This institute would collect a number of interdisciplinary skills from science, engineering, public management and public policy, among others. This new entity would be a resource that could synergistically apply its various expertise to significant space policy matters. The Preliminary SOW, additional updates to this document and other preliminary documentation related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application. The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/HQ Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=04  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments. Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>This is modification #8 to the synopsis entitled Occupational Medicine and Occupational Health Contract (OMOHC), which was posted on August 13, 2004.  Potential Offerors are notified that there will be a schedule extension in posting the draft RFP and postponement of the Pre Proposal Conference. The Conference scheduled for January 19, 2005 at the Johnson Space Center, Gilruth Center, Houston, Texas has been postponed.    The government has elected to use an Award Term contract type in lieu of a traditional Award Fee contract for this procurement. Award Term is a new contract approach for JSC as part of a pilot program. JSC is extending the release of the Draft RFP and the subsequent Pre Proposal Conference to ensure all salient features of this pilot program are addressed.  It has taken the team longer than expected to clearly define these features.  It is our goal to ensure that these features are identified as part of the Draft RFP in order to ensure a meaningful dialogue throughout the procurement process.   The revised schedule and date of the Pre Proposal Conference will be provided via modification through the NAIS system when it is determined. No response to this modification is required.   Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.  Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any) Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 1 to SolicitationW914NS-05-Q-0009:

Question 1:  CLIN 0005 appears to be a duplicate of CLIN 0003. Is it a duplicate CLIN, or is the requirement to provide a qty of 2 DVORs. Answer: CLIN 0003 is a duplicate of CLIN 0005, delete CLIN 0003. There is only one (1) D-VOR/DME.
CLIN 0007 makes reference to connecting the radios to a consolidated terminal. Please provide further clarification as to the 'consolidated terminal.”ANSWER: Consolidated Terminal should be in a console within the ATC Tower. 

Question 2:  In the paragraph immediately following CLIN 0017, the solicitation notice states:
'Provide a proposal with a construction cost estimate for the Basra Airport in accordance with the Statement of work that is attachment 1.  The proposal shall include pricing for a complete system at Basra Airport. The cost proposal shall be in individual line item format.  Costs for all options should be included'. We interpret this to mean that the offeror is to provide a cost estimate for the civil works, which involves siting of the ATC equipment and installation of the items delivered under CLINS 0001-0009, 0011 and 0014 above. We also interpret this to be a request for a cost estimate separate to the pricing requested for CLINs 0001 through 0017, and that is should be a cost estimate as opposed to FFP. Please confirm that this is a correct interpretation. Also, which requirements should be considered as options? ANSWER:  This is not a CLIN but is a statement to indicate that the proposal shall be to supply a complete system. If Offeror has no options, then last line does not apply.  All pricing should be for a firm fixed price contract. 

Question 3: You have requested pricing for commercial products sold internationally, however the SOW requires deliverables above and beyond those that are normally provided commercially, such as drawings converted to metric measurements and produced in Arabic. Can documentation be provided in the English language only? Answer: Drawings in English with metric measurements are acceptable. The solicitation includes 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders/Commercial Items.  This clause invites the CO to incorporate certain clauses by reference, however no clauses are checked. Is it your intent to identify those clauses that are to be incorporated by reference? ANSWER: Yes, they will incorporated by reference in the contract.
Is clause 52.232-30, Installment Payments, likely to be applicable?  ANSWER: Installment or Advanced payments will not be authorized however, the Government will entertain Progress Payments.

Question 4:  CLIN 0014 refers to an “Air Traffic Control tower and/or Approach Control facility”.  CLIN 0007 refers to “limited Approach Control Support”.  There is no other reference to an Approach Control in the other documents.  Since the automation equipment requested in CLIN 0002 does not adequately support a full approach control functionality could you provide additional clarification as to the intent?  ANSWER:  CLIN 0014 Delete “and/or Approach Control Facility.” CLIN 0007 Change “ “limited Approach Control support” to read “limited Approach support”. Approach Radar at Basra is to function as a “stand alone” facility, but it should have the capability to expand-be linked to the Approach Control Facility at Baghdad as part of a nationwide system.

Question 5:  Reference CLIN 0007: Ground to air radio Communication Systems: "Approach Control (APP) be linked to a consolidated Terminal Approach Control (TRACON) located at Baghdad International Airport". Does this mean that just the radio channels (frequencies 121.5 and 243.0 MHz) are to be remoted back to the Baghdad ACC  (TRACON) via the existing VSAT network?  Is there a requirement to remote any of the other 9 radios back to the Baghdad TRACON?

<DESC>This is the third modification to Solicitation W914NS-05-Q-0021.  This modification is to provide answers to questions posed by industry. 



QUESTION: Reference SOW 1.3 – Regarding the 50 personnel, how many, if any, are fully qualified to work all of the tower positions without direct supervision? 

ANSWER:  Approximately 12.

QUESTION: Reference SOW 1.3 – Have all the personnel had ATC classroom training of some type? 

ANSWER:  All have had either refresher or primary ATC training in either Jordon or Singapore within the past 14 months.

QUESTION:   Reference SOW 1.5 & 1.6 – Do the mid-2005 time frames refer to equipment only, or is that the date when the facilities are expected to begin providing service. 

ANSWER: The Area Control Center is expected to start limited operation by mid-2005. Both the ACC and the radar approach control are subject to delay due to contractual or equipment problems.

QUESTION: Reference SOW 2.1 & 6.6 – What type of equipment, including simulators, if any, is currently available for training?  

ANSWER: There are no simulators currently available. It is expected that an ACC and (collocated) radar lab will be available by mid-2005.

QUESTION:  Reference SOW 2.3.16 – Please confirm that Baghdad and Basrah will have TRACON, and that Erbil, Mosul and Sulaymaniya are ATCT only.
 
ANSWER: This is correct although Basrah’s TRACON may be limited to airport arrival and departure service only.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS; IT IS STRICTLY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI).  NEITHER UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS NOR ANY OTHER TYPES OF OFFERS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI.  

This is a sources sought/market research conducted in accordance with FAR Part 10.  The Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), Hurlburt AFB FL is currently performing market research to determine what types of commercial service offerings and related capabilities currently exist for.  Man Portable Air Defense (MANPAD) training system.  AFSOC seeks responses to this RFI from commercial sources to indicate what kinds of MANPAD training system equipment they currently offer.  A MANPAD training system will incorporate Missile Warning System (MWS) stimulation and visual cueing.  Background: The system will be able to stimulate current onboard MWS's, and upgradeable to meet same requirements on future onboard MWS’s.  The system will have a feedback capability for post-flight and/or engagement debriefing to aircrews.  Feedback from the training device's perspective.  Includes, but not limited to:  (1) Time/duration of engagement (2) MANPAD lock success/failure (3) Number of launches.  The system will have the same limitations as the MANPAD simulated.  The system, to include all components, will be easily transportable in a single vehicle and not tied to a fixed site.  The system will be operated by no more than two people--carrying, lifting, and operating.  The system will require minimal logistic support and training.  The system will provide:  (1) MWS Simulation (2) Projectile launch for scanner training.  The system will be modular in design--tailor the components to the mission need.  The system will be all-weather/environment, day and night capable.  No aircraft interface will be required.  The capability must be simple enough in operation to allow training personnel to operate without complex preparation and logistics support.  The system will not use proprietary software.  The system will be safe to operate and not require special operation, handling, or storage requirements beyond that required for corresponding munitions.  In responding to this RFI, respondents should indicate whether currently commercially available solutions are available that could provide the following services/capabilities and exactly how the system works.  Finally, AFSOC seeks commercial price list information (or possible range of pricing if commercial price list does not exist) for MANPAD training systems, as noted above that is currently available in the marketplace.  This pricing should reflect how current MANPAD training systems are currently priced and structured for commercial marketplace sales, including any tiered pricing that is available.  Respondents should email responses and, if available, commercially available literature and commercial price list information to richard.bremer@hurlburt.af.mil no later than 8 Feb 05.  Such responses will be used to assist AFSOC in determining how to construct minimum requirements in the event that procurement is conducted in the future.

<DESC>NA--The Government intends to award a sole source supplemental modification under Contract No. DACA83-03-C-0003 with Robert & Company (RAC) for the final design of FY05 Clear Water Rinse Facility (CWRF) at Hickam Air Force Base, Oahu, Hawaii. RAC is currently designing the Hydrant Fuel System (HFS) and Strategic Airlift Aircraft Ramp (Strat Ramp) at Hickam Air Force Base under the aforementioned contract. The proposed supplemental modification will add the following to the scope of work: (1) completio n of the final design for CWRF; (2) separation of the Strat Ramp design to create a separate piece that will be connected to the CWRF; and (3) development of a single design that integrates the separate Strat Ramp piece with the CWRF. The integration of tw o projects (Strat Ramp and CWRF) will provide for the following technical advantages: (1) RAC must redesign the Strat Ramp into 2 pieces, one to be integrated with the CWRF to create a single project, and the other to remain with the HFS package; (2) the C WRF will tie-in to drainage and power systems designed by RAC for the Strat Ramp project; and (3) RAC has the expertise to design a blast barrier that is needed to protect aircraft on the CWRF from engine run-up blasts from aircraft on the Strat Ramp. Prod ucing a homogenous design by combining the Strat Ramp with CWRF requires expertise that is unique to RAC, and will reduce pavement and excavation costs. Any interested contractors shall respond by February 24, 2005. See Note 22.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice seeking to identify potential vendors capable of providing veterinary support services for the National Center for Animal Health Programs Tuberculosis Program.  
 
Veterinary Services (VS)/Animal and Plant Inspection Service (APHIS) protects and improves the health, quality, and marketability of our nation's animals, animal products and veterinary biologics by  preventing, controlling and/or eliminating animal diseases, and  monitoring and promoting animal health and productivity.  The National Center for Animal Health Programs (NCAHP) department within VS executes critical national animal disease eradication & control programs for Brucellosis, Tuberculosis, Scrapie, Chronic Wasting Disease, Pseudorabies, Swine Health, Surveillance, Johne’s, Aquaculture, Equine Infectious Anemia, Cattle Ticks, Blue Tongue, Horse Transport, Wildlife Disease Evaluation, and others. Specifically, the NCAHP initiates, leads, advises, coordinates, and facilitates, national certification and eradication programs which promote, ensure, and improve U.S. animal health, by preventing, minimizing, or eradicating animal diseases of economic concern in light of constituent values.  

One of the national animal programs for NCAHP is bovine tuberculosis.  Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of livestock and humans.  The cattle form of the disease (bovine tuberculosis) is caused by the bacteria, Mycobacterium bovis.  This disease can be spread from livestock to humans and other animals.  In cattle the disease is a chronic and insidious malady that generally progresses slowly until an advanced stage of debilitation is reached, at which time the animal usually becomes a shedder and transmitter of the causative agent to other animals or humans.  

On October 23rd, 2000 the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency in regard to finalizing and bringing closure to the final eradication of Bovine TB.  As a part of the accelerated Bovine TB eradication effort, both prior to and subsequent to the Secretary’s declaration, intensive inspection, review and verification visits have been carried out. These inspection/reviews have been used in TB affected zones and states, both in the U.S. and Mexico, to assure that program standards are being applied in a manner consistent with sound livestock disease control and eradication principles.

Because of the need to conduct increasing numbers of reviews, both in various states in the U.S. and in Mexico and possibly Canada, it is imperative to recruit the aid of expert and experienced technical/professional personnel outside of the current pool of state, federal and industry employees upon which VS has been dependent.

The Government is seeking sources capable of assisting TB eradication teams in reviewing and assessing TB control measures.  The reviews are focused on assessing the ability of the zone, region or state to meet or exceed the requirements spelled out in the eleven zoosanitary criteria for regionalization in accordance with the expectations of North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), while also considering the requirements of the national TB program status level being sought.

Potential sources ideally possess considerable expertise and experience in the pathogenesis and epidemiology of cattle tuberculosis; the development, implementation and operation of livestock disease control and eradication strategies and with some experience and previous involvement on review and investigation of program integrity either in the U.S. or Mexico to work on this task. Actual field based experience and awareness in these areas is preferable. Graduate degrees in veterinary medicine are desired but not required if the individual has extensive knowledge and experience working with the National Tuberculosis Eradication program within a state.

Sources will need to isolate and evaluate specified characteristics of a zone, region or state identified as deficient in an earlier site review while participating on team reviews or re-reviews.  The reassessment of a zone, region or state must determine, based on sound science and known and accepted livestock disease control and eradication practices, whether sufficient improvements have been made to justify a revision and upgrade to a previously assigned status for the zone, region or state. 

Sources will be required to:

1.	Represent APHIS in meetings and in one on one interchanges with state officials, including the Governor and Secretary of Agriculture level, as well as presidents, executives and members of local, state and national cattlemen’s organizations and private and public practitioners of veterinary medicine; all in connection with the conduct of TB and Animal Health Programs in the U.S., Mexico and possibly Canada.

2.	Become familiar with and evaluate the legal framework and infrastructure of the geopolitical entity including federal, state and local rules, regulations, guidelines and laws upon which TB control and eradication is based.
3.	Investigate and assess the infrastructure of the State/Industry/Federal entity responsible for control and eradication of TB in the zone, region or state under review.

4.	Review the ongoing TB efforts for purposes of verification that program activities are in full compliance with the legal framework.

5.	Go into livestock slaughtering facilities in the area and conduct, as a part of the team, qualitative and quantitative reviews of the inspection activities as related to ante & post mortem examinations for granulomas, their collection and submission and of the process for identification of the submissions for trace back purposes.

6.	Compare and assess the integrity of the overall TB program in a zone, region or state as compared to the eleven regionalization criteria. These criteria have now become the accepted measures for evaluation and comparison of TB control/eradication programs against a uniform and common standard.
7.	Verify the reported herd prevalence of TB for the area and compare against the levels of prevalence set out for each of the 5 levels of status provided for in the U.S. program.

8.	Observe, assess and evaluate cattle movement control procedures to mitigate the introduction and dissemination of cattle TB into higher status areas and to protect such areas from exposure via the introduction of animals from areas of lesser status.

9.	Visit diagnostic laboratories and assess the quality of diagnostic histopathology, bacteriology and PCR, when applicable.  A critical part of this activity is to seek out actual examples of turn around times for reporting back results to program officials and to submitters of samples, when indicated.

10.	Review the public information efforts for dissemination of information and facts about TB and the program for its control and eradication.

11.	Update reference material to reflect latest thinking and findings in this field.

12.	Evaluate the TB training efforts for field and laboratory veterinarians and other program personnel.

13.	Analyze and verify the inventory and census for total cattle and total herds in the area under review.

14.	As a part of the review, evaluation and assessment process, in an ongoing dialogue and during closure the contractor, as a part of the team, should be able to convey in a concise and clear, but diplomatic and tactful way, findings and recommendations for TB program improvements.

15.	Prepare and submit reports within allotted timeframes that clearly and concisely elucidate the findings of the team with recommendations and/or recognition and commendations as indicated.

This notice is not to be construed as an acquisition Request For Proposal (RFP), nor is any commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract implied, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to 
otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts.
  
Any responses received will not be used as a proposal.  Company responses are to include a name and telephone number of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.  Company responses should include a one page cover letter, a narrative summary of key personnel qualifications and an annotated briefing on company capabilities.  Companies are not limited to a single response.  Submissions are due within 20 days of this announcement and may be made by e-mail or mailing your response on a compact disk to:

This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the “art of the possible” from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies for the animal identification purposes.  Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such.  Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure.  The Government will not use any proprietary information submitted to establish the capability, requirements, approach, or solution so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.

US and non-US firms are permitted to respond to this request.  Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and provided equally to all interested parties unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a Company or that Company’s possible solution.  Currently one-on-one sessions with respondents are not contemplated.  If one-on-one sessions with interested parties are conducted, they will be offered to all to clarify understanding of the submittal and the capability ramifications.

This notice may be updated as additional information becomes available. Please continue to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities Website to receive notices of any updates to this announcement.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) BEING RELEASED 
PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) PART 		
10 Market Research.  The US Coast Guard (USCG) issues this RFI regarding navigational ocean buoys for market research, informational, and planning purposes only.  The USCG is 	
searching for designers, vendors, and/or manufacturers interested and capable of providing designs, specifications, and prototype(s) for a navigational ocean buoy that will potentially replace a significant percentage of USCG’s current class of approximately 1,400 steel ocean buoys.  The intent is for this new buoy to provide at least equivalent performance to the current 8x26 buoy, but at a reduced total ownership cost.  The new buoy shall serve as a platform to support a self-contained light emitting diode (LED) light signal package (approximately 50 pounds) at a focal height of approximately 15 feet.  It shall also provide radar reflectivity, a visual daymark, and lateral shape significance.  It shall be used in exposed environmental conditions, including areas of extreme weather, wind, wave, and current speed, and shall be subject to collisions with passing vessels.  Mooring depths shall be between 25 feet and 250 feet.  It shall be deployed and retrieved by USCG 225-foot WLB class and 175-foot WLM class buoy tenders (working load limits of 40,000 lbs and 20,000 lbs respectively).  The signal package which the buoy supports shall be serviced periodically by USCG personnel while the buoy is afloat on station.  The buoy shall therefore require a means for the servicing personnel to climb up and access the signal equipment, and it shall need to support at least two of these personnel and their equipment (minimum of 450 lbs total) while remaining stable.  Maintenance, disposal, or recycling of the buoy is intended to be through means currently available to the USCG, unless a more beneficial means is proposed.  The total ownership cost of the current 8x26 buoy is estimated to be $22,000.  This USCG’s total ownership cost includes initial purchase in year 0; three shore side overhauls (blasting, metalwork, repainting) in years 6, 12, and 18; and disposal in year 24.  Respondents interested in pursuing this work for the USCG should submit information which clearly describes the company’s (a) capabilities, (b) standard product lines including navigational ocean buoys of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace or modified to meet the USCG’s needs, (c) estimated rough order of magnitude per the design and unit, (d) estimated delivery time once ordered, (e) customary practices including warranty (if any) and discounts, (f) availability of the ocean navigation buoys that contain recovered materials, (g) major customers, and (h) any other information that your company feels is pertinent to this acquisition.  In addition, firms who wish to respond to this RFI shall include their business size in accordance with NAICS Code 332313/321999 (NAICS Code will be selected prior to the solicitation being released), Dun and Bradstreet number, and any other Government contracts held including GSA Schedule should they hold one.The primary focus in this submittal should be on areas related to the work described in this RFI.  If the company believes that items in its standard product line would meet the need described in this RFI, relevant product literature may be included in the submittal.  There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.  This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied, or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor’s information.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Please submit information via email to Eric McDoniel, Contract Specialist, at emcdoniel@comdt.uscg.mil or Mrs. Linda B. Dearing at ldearing@comdt.uscg.mil no later than 3:00 PM on 28 January 2004.

<SUBJECT>R -- USZA22-02-D-0014 AND USZA22-02-D-0015 CEILING INCREASE
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to modify the original Special Notice published on 7 June 04 to allow for the full 15 day requirement for announcement as stated in FAR 5.203. See below for repeat of the announcement:

The purpose of this synopsis is to announce the revision of the contract ceilings on the Acquisition Logistics Management and Business Operations Support (ALMBOS) contracts supporting the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). These contracts are two multiple-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts awarded on 5 December 2001. Accordingly, this action will increase the current contract ceilings by $180M from $120M to $300M on each of these contracts. These contracts contain a base period and four ordering periods (5 years) plus three award term incentive periods?each one year in duration. Final expiration date of the last ordering period is 30 April 2007 and if earned the final incentive period would end on 30 April 2010. It is necessary to increase the ceiling due to (1) unanticipated high level of support for the war-onterrorism as a result of the events of September 11, 2001 (9/11); and (2) the USSOCOM mission change based on the events of 9/11. All work to be performed under the contract is considered to be in accordance with the original statement of work; however, the war-onterrorism increased the amount of work to be accomplished to an amount not contemplated in the original ceiling price. As a result of the requirements placed against these contracts supporting the war-on-terrorism and due to USSOCOM mission change, the original established contract ceiling of $120M is expected to be reached in contract year four. An increase in the ceiling will provide for continued critical support of various projects for the USSOCOM. The increase will ensure sufficient contract ceiling is available for any award term incentives earned by the industry partners and for new tasks supporting the USSOCOM mission. A competitive follow-on acquisition is planned to replace these contracts when they expire on 30 April 2007, unless the award term incentive periods are earned, in which case 30 April 2008, 30 April 2009, or 30 April 2010 will be the expiration date. All task orders processed under the ALMBOS contracts are and will continue to be competed using fair opportunity procedures between the two ALMBOS contractors unless a fair opportunity exception in accordance with FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies (logical follow-on). The two ALMBOS contractors and numbers are: Sverdrup Technology, Inc. under USZA22-02-D-0014 and Gemini Industries, Inc. under USZA22-02-D-0015. The expected date of executing this action is 21 June 2004. See numbered note 22.

<SUBJECT>R -- Intent to Sole Source
<DESC>SUMMARY

The United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to establish a sole source requirements contract for five years (base year and four option years) to the Center for International and Interarea Comparisons (CIIC) for expert economic consultant services in support of the COLA program in conjunction with our implementation of technical changes made pursuant to the stipulation for settlement in Caraballo et al. v. United States, Civil No. 197/27 (D.V.I.) in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1); FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 


SECTION A:  SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COSTS

*Includes all indirect costs.

3.  TRAVEL

All travel shall be authorized in advance and indicated in the task order.  The Government will not reimburse the Contractor at the hourly rates while the contractor is in a travel status.  Travel expenses must not exceed the approved Government rates.  Costs shall be reimbursed in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations as prescribed by the General Services Administration.  

SECTION B   DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/WORK STATEMENT

2.	BACKGROUND.  

The OPM establishes COLAs pursuant to section 5941 of title 5, United States Code; Executive Order 10000, as amended; and subpart B of part 591, title 5, Code of Federal Regulations.  Within OPM, the Salary and Wage Systems Group, Center for Pay and Performance Policy, Strategic Human Resources Policy Division, administers the COLA program.  The Government pays COLAs to most white-collar civilian Federal and U.S. Postal Service employees in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  COLAs are based on living costs in these areas compared with living costs in the Washington, DC area.  We conduct price surveys in the COLA areas and in the DC area to estimate the differences in living costs.  

In 2000, the Government agreed to a stipulation for settlement in Caraballo v. United States, No. 1997-0027 (D.V.I.), August 17, 2000.  The settlement established the Survey Implementation Committee (SIC) and Technical Advisory Committee (TAC).  The SIC is composed of plaintiffs’ representatives and OPM representatives.  The TAC is a committee of three economists—one selected by the plaintiffs, one selected by OPM, and a neutral chair selected by both parties.  The TAC advises the SIC on issues relating to the implementation of changes to the COLA methodology that we are implementing pursuant to the settlement agreement.  The TAC is the successor to the Technical Advisory Group (TAG), an identical committee established in 1996 to advise the parties as they worked collaboratively to reach a settlement on long-contested COLA issues.  

 
3.	GENERAL SCOPE OF REQUIREMENT   

We need an expert economic and statistical consultant to serve as our representative on the TAC and to provide technical advice and assistance to us.  Because the COLA program has high visibility and a history of litigation, all work to be performed under this contract must be complete, technically accurate, and able to withstand legal challenge and close public scrutiny.  

The consultant shall be our representative on the TAC, shall attend all meetings and telecons, and shall be responsible for all work performed under this contract.  With our approval, the consultant may hire or subcontract with other personnel to perform support work, but only to the extent that such support work does not jeopardize the quality, thoroughness, and professionalism of the overall work performed.  The consultant shall confer with OPM before hiring or subcontracting for support work.  These costs may be negotiated as part of priced task orders.

When the consultant cannot attend or participate because of an emergency, serious illness, or similar unforeseen circumstances, the consultant may, with our advance approval, designate an alternate to represent him or her at TAC meetings, in telecons, or at other meetings.  However, we expect the consultant to attend all meetings and telecons except in extenuating circumstances. The hourly rate for substitute consultant(s) is subject to negotiation and shall not exceed the rate established for the primary consultant established herein.

During this contract, the consultant shall attend, provide informational presentations at, and materially participate in all TAC meetings; represent fully our concerns; and provide us with oral or written reports of the meetings and the issues discussed.  The consultant may also be asked to provide separately to our technical economic and econometric advice and expertise on living-cost theory and practice and may be requested to perform specific research on selected living-cost issues as they relate to the COLA program.  The consultant shall agree further to serve, if necessary, as an expert witness for us in administrative, congressional, or judicial proceedings to be paid for under a separate purchase order or contract, not as part of this contract.

We anticipate that the consultant will perform more of the work required under this contract in the base rather than in the option years because the TAC will be extensively involved in developing hedonic regressions to determine relative rental prices and in reviewing the results of the General Population Rental Equivalence Survey (GPRES), which we are currently conducting.

4.	REQUIREMENTS OVERVIEW

We will specify the work that the consultant is to perform in a task order proposal request.  The contractor’s technical and price proposals are subject to evaluation and negotiation, if necessary.  Task orders may be firm, fixed-price or labor hour at the option of OPM.  The work to be performed will be negotiated prior to the award of the task.  As part of these negotiations, the consultant shall deliver to us a technical and cost proposal that sets forth the level of effort, reports, and deliverables associated with any request for research.

4.1. 	Represent OPM on Technical Advisory Committee (TAC).

The consultant shall represent us on the TAC.  He or she shall attend all TAC meetings, participate in all TAC telephone conferences, and provide us with an oral (or electronic mail, if necessary) summary of each within 2 working days.  As requested, the contractor shall provide an acceptable written summary of each within five working days.  As directed by us, the consultant shall also participate in SIC meetings and telephone conference calls (telecons).

We are not able to specify how many hours of work will be required to prepare for, attend, and follow-up on the TAC meetings.  We anticipate that during fiscal year 2005, the consultant will attend joint meetings of the SIC, TAC, and Pacific COLA Advisory Committees, which we established to advise us in planning and conducting the Pacific surveys and reviewing the results. We also anticipate that the consultant will attend a joint SIC/TAC meeting in May 2005 relating to GPRES and in October 2005 relating to anticipated comments concerning COLA rate adjustments.  The SIC and the TAC dissolve on December 31, 2005.  Thereafter, the consultant will provide services directly to OPM on an as-requested basis.

 
4.2.  	Provide Technical Economic Research, Advice, and Assistance to OPM

As OPM requests, the consultant shall advise the Government regarding the various issues relating to living-cost comparisons and COLA surveys.  OPM may ask the consultant to research specific issues; summarize, explain, or evaluate economic literature; and/or provide OPM with bibliographies on living-cost research and analyses.  The work to be performed must be complete, technically accurate, and be able to withstand legal challenge and close public and professional scrutiny. 

4.3.  	Serve as an Expert Witness for the Government.

At OPM’s request, the consultant shall serve as an expert witness for the Government in any administrative, congressional, or judicial proceedings concerning any work performed under this contract.  

5.	DELIVERABLES 

All deliverables will be subject to review and approval in accordance with the Performance Requirements Summary, section 9 below.  If we ask for clarifications, the consultant will have 10 working days from the date of our notice to provide such clarification.

5.1.  	TAC Meetings and Telecon Reports.  

The consultant shall provide us with an oral (or electronic mail, if necessary) report of each TAC meeting and telecon within two working days after the meeting or telecon and, if requested, a written report within five working days after the meeting or telecon.  Each report must address key topics discussed, summarize the decisions/ recommendations reached; and highlight areas of agreement and disagreement.  The length of any written reports will depend on the length of the meeting or telecon and the number and complexity of the issues discussed.  

5.2. 	Bibliographies, Abstracts, and Copies of Relevant Materials.  

As we request, the consultant shall compile and provide to OPM’s bibliographies of research of living-cost issues and when requested shall also provide abstracts and copies of relevant materials.   The contractor may need to write summaries where sufficient detail is not already available about the research.  The abstracts or summaries must be of sufficient length to identify and explain all major issues and findings of the material being reviewed.  The contractor may also be required to explain verbally or in writing the conclusions reached in the research and the interrelationships among research efforts and the implications for the COLA program.  Copies of off-the-shelf materials may be either originals or photocopies, provided there is no infringement of copyrights. 

5.3. 	Research Reports.

If we request research, the consultant shall conduct it based on sound, professionally accepted economic principles and shall produce accurate, fully-researched, and well-documented reports.  The content and length of these reports will depend on the subject to be researched.  If and when a research request is made, OPM and the consultant will determine the parameters for the research and report(s) and will negotiate its price.

6.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE

OPM anticipates that the consultant will perform the majority of the work at his/her own facility. As noted earlier, the consultant will also perform work at the site(s) where the SIC and/or TAC meet.  On occasion, at OPM’s request, the consultant will perform work at OPM’s Central Office at 1900 E St., NW, Washington, DC.


7.	GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED PROPERTY

The Government shall not provide any property under this contract.


8.	GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED INFORMATION

OPM shall provide the consultant with copies of rental survey data and GPRES data.  All such data are the property of the Federal Government.  The consultant shall not use the data for purposes other than analyses performed under this contract, and the contractor shall destroy or return to OPM, at OPM’s sole prerogative, all such data.  We shall also provide the contractor with the results of our annual COLA surveys.  


9.	ACCEPTABLE QUALITY LEVEL 

Deliverable	Performance Standard	Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) 	Monitoring Method 	Incentive / Price Reduction

1.  TAC Meetings and Telecon Reports

OPM staff would be the recipient of such reports and will be able to assess suitability, completeness, and timeliness.	
Positive Performance Evaluation


Dr. Alan Heston, President of CIIC, has served as our representative on the TAC since 2000, and served as our representative on the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) from 1996 to present.  The TAG was a committee established to advise the parties as they planned and reviewed living-cost research and worked to reach a settlement.  He has a detailed understanding of the COLA methodology, the Caraballo settlement, and the voluminous research that the parties conducted prior to that settlement, and the discussions between the parties that lead to the settlement. Only the CIIC has the knowledge, experience, expertise, and background necessary to represent us on the TAC and to provide the expert consultant services that we require.

If CIIC were not selected for this contract, it would take another vendor over a year to become expert in the COLA program, the Caraballo settlement, and research and discussions that lead to the Caraballo settlement.  In addition, the vendor would need extensive briefings from our staff and other members of the TAC to understand the research and discussions and to place in context the settlement and the current methodology.  Such briefings would be very costly to us and ourstaff does not have time for such briefings.  We cannot compel or reimburse other TAC members for providing such briefings in its stead.  Under the Caraballo settlement, it is critical that we have a representative on the TAC.  We risk additional litigation if it fails to appoint a knowledgeable and expert representative to the TAC and/or implements the COLA methodology without benefit of economic expertise.  Such litigation could cost the Government millions of dollars.  At a cost of $232.5 million, Caraballo was a landmark settlement and one of the largest Federal Government human resources settlements of all time.

Interested parties are reminded that information furnished under this solicitation may be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  Therefore, items that are confidential to businesses, or contain trade secrets, proprietary, or personnel information must be clearly marked.  Marking of items will not necessarily preclude disclosure when the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM or the Government) determines disclosure when warranted by FOIA.  However, if such items are not marked, all information contained within the submitted documents will be deemed to be releasable.  

This in no way obligates the Government to award a sole-source requirements contract. This is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all interested parties who believe they can meet this requirement are invited to submit a statement of capability with pricing information, within 15 days of publication of this notice. The Government will not pay for any information provided.  Information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.  Interested parties are requested to contact Toni Campbell at Antoinette.Campbell@opm.gov or by fax 202 606-1464

1.0	INTRODUCTION

The new NOAA Ship HI'IALAKAI requires a remotely operated submersible vehicle (ROV) for the ship-based field research.  The HI'IALAKAI will support government organizations conducting research throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago and U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands.  

2.0	GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND SCOPE OF WORK

The diversity of ecosystem monitoring and assessment projects to be supported by the HI'IALAKAI requires the ROV to be capable of:
o	Reliable operation in a remote offshore environment, at time in open ocean currents, to a depth of 2,000 feet (600m).
o	Steady maneuvering near potentially rugged coral on the seafloor, at times making contact with the bottom.  This requires high power to weight ratio and a low center of gravity.
o	Using a video camera system with operator display
o	Staging from ship's deck.  This requires portability and straightforward control features.
o	Field maintainable, without special tools or training.
o	Option for later field upgrade, to add a manipulator arm.
Piloting of the ROV must be sufficiently intuitive for relatively inexperienced technicians, and as such NOAA requires that the ROV be a commercial-off-the-shelf product with a proven design and a number of completed previous deliveries.  Minor modifications to a standard package to meet requirements are acceptable, but a completely new designed package is not acceptable.

3.0	SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The standard industrial classification code is 3825 Instruments for measuring electrical quantities manufacturing, NAICS 334515, 500 employees.

Best value may include, but is not limited to: past performance, technical capability, quality, trade-in considerations, probable life, warranty,  maintainability and price. Offers must meet all minimum specifications but offers which exceed minimums may be rated more favorably. The government will not, however, pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price. Since the government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price. Notwithstanding that technical capability is more important than price, should all offers appear equal, price will become the determining factor in the award decision.

The warranty period shall begin upon final acceptance of the applicable deliverables listed in the schedule.  The government elects to award any, all, or none of the items above.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>This is a combined commercial item synopsis/solicitation prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This announcement is a request for quote.  This request for quote will be evaluated in accordance with lowest price, technically acceptable solicitation procedures detailed in FAR 15.101-2.  To be considered technically acceptable the quote must contain information about the proposed recovery method.  Any proposed recovery method must insure minimal damage is caused to the buoy or its instruments. The solicitation number is QA1330-05-RQ-1137 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2001-27.  The contract will be a firm-fixed price order.  The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) Stennis Space Center, MS 39529 requires service to retrieve a 6-meter buoy from the beach at Yakutat Bay, Alaska in accordance with the following statement of work (SOW):
STATEMENT OF WORK
Retrieve 6N36 from Yakutat Bay, AK
GENERAL:
This document defines the task required to retrieve NDBC buoy 6N36 from the beach at Yakutat Bay Alaska and return the buoy to a nearby pier in the Yakutat area.  The contractor will provide all labor, equipment, hardware, disposal fees, to salvage the buoy.   NDBC will arrange for and pay the temporarily storage costs once pier side. 6N36 is a 6-meter boat-shaped buoy with a forward and aft mast and appears to be buried approximately 2 feet.  See attached photographs of the buoy.
BACKGROUND:
The buoy 6N36 was deployed at station 46083.  On October 25, 2004, buoy 6N36 went adrift from its mooring drifting into Yakutat Bay and grounding on the North East side.  A backup position indicator is still functioning and a fly over confirmed the buoy to be at  position (590 48.0”N, 1390 53.6”W).
The buoy is boat-shaped, 20 ft long, and 9.8 ft wide, with a hull depth of 7 ft.  The buoy hull displaces 13,900 lb, with a reserve buoyancy capacity of 19,733 lb.  The upper mooring attaches to a stainless steel yoke and weighs 2000 lb.  The buoy has four compartments the forward and aft compartments contain foam.  The two center compartments contain the buoy's batteries and electronic equipment.  There are 43 Cegasa batteries and six Concorde batteries.  The buoy can be lifted using the four lift padeyes, or towed using the yoke, bow padeye, or towing hole in the keel.  The aft padeye (above the keel) is not designed to lift loads and will break if loaded. 
The buoy may have a high concentration of hydrogen due to the batteries discharging without venting.  In addition the batteries may have cracked and mixed with sea water, causing a caustic solution.  The buoy interior should be considered a confined space.
SCOPE OF WORK:
The salvage company will remove the buoy from the beach of Yakutat Bay and move to a nearby pier in the Yakutat area.  The preferred method of removing the buoy from the beach is by lifting with a helicopter.  If possible recover the failed component in the buoy's mooring.
The salvage company will verify the buoy's atmosphere before entry.  Buoy atmosphere shall be verified at the vent and hatch plugs prior to entry in accordance with applicable OSHA standards.  
Remove the forward and aft mast from the buoy if the buoy needs to be lifted.  If the masts are removed prepare the buoy by covering the buoy opening and securing the buoy's masts, and yoke.
NDBC will arrange and pay to ship the buoy to Stennis Space Center Mississippi.
All offerors shall submit a firm-fixed price quote. The quote shall include the unit price based on a daily rate.  The daily rate shall include all costs associated with this effort. The following FAR provisions or clauses apply to this acquisition: 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial; 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items; 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Order-Commercial Items; 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity; 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and Other Eligible Veterans; 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities; 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration; 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-Central Contractor Registration; 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965, as Amended; 52.247-21 Contractor Liability for Personal Injury and/or Property; 52.247-21 Contractor Liability for Personal Injury and/or Property Damage; 52.228-9 Cargo Insurance.

Quotes may be faxed to 228-688-3153 or emailed to Dennis.Morris@noaa.gov, or mailed to: National Data Buoy Center, Attn: Dennis Morris, Building 1100 Room 360, Stennis Space Center, MS 39529.

Ghosting and  in-line problems shall not be acceptable.  

DISPLAY EXAMINATION: Examination of the camera copy is an integral part of specifications.  No additional payment will be allowed due the contractor’s failure to examine the copy and throughly understand the nature and extend of the work to be performed. (Strongly recommended).

PRESS INSPECTION: Press sheets shall be inspected at the contractors printing facility for quality conformance.  Each press sheet form must contain one color bar, at least 3/16 inch in width, for each ink color placed parallel to the ink rollers.

Ink densities shall be constant across the full width of the sheet with no deviations to exceed plus or minus one half of one percent.  Light and heavy inking is not allowed.  The contractor shall provide the correct viewing conditions for all press sheet inspections including 5000 degrees kelvin light sources housed in a completely enclosed neutral gray booth and functional densitometers.

PREAWARD SURVEY: In order to determine the responsibility of the prime contractor, the government reserves the right to conduct a preaward survey, or to require samples to QATAP evaluate, or other evidence of technical, managerial, financial and similar abilities to perform, prior to the award of a contract.

PACKING: Shrink wrap in conveniently sized groups or individually.  Pack in new 44 pound edge crush test corrugated boxes with corrugated sheets between the columns (to prevent element entanglements).

<DESC>Question and answer for solicitation W91RUS-05-R-0002: Q1:  In Section C.4.7 it is stated that images of faxed, or to be faxed documents, if stored on Internet accessible devices, must be eradicated once the image is processed, or after a predetermined period of time that is acceptable to the Government.  Late r, in Section C.7 Reports, it is stated that both outgoing and incoming fax transmissions, shall be logged and viewable in electronic and paper media so that the auditing of the fax process can be facilitated. Interpretation of these sections are as follows: 1.  In Section C.4.7, believe the operative word is Internet accessible.  Interpret this to mean, that the image is only allowed to be stored for the duration of the transaction.  2.  In Section C.7, clarification is needed to understand if your requirement is to store the images of the outbound and inbound fax documents, which seems to be in conflict with Section C.4.7, or just the details of the transaction.   Please clarify the the two sections. A1:  Agree with the assessment as far as what Internet Accessible means. Locked down network drives are not. As far as reports go, line item accounting of every fax sent and received, usually at monthly intervals. This more than meets the auditing requirements.

<DESC>Questions and Answers to solicitation W91RUS-05-R-0002: Q1.  Is the storage requirement only for inbound fax documents to the individuals account mailbox or is also required for outbound fax documents? A1.  Storage is for inbound only (see expanded answer below). Q2.  Documents of type covered by this solicitation may be required to be stored for long durations (i.e. up to 7 years)?  Should the response provide for the capability for storage beyond the stated storage amount and also beyond the expected term of the contract for the secure fax services. A2.  No(see expanded answer below).  Q3.  How is the system expected to respond in the event a user exceeds the allotted storage space (e.g. 50MB, 200MB)?  Should it overwrite oldest entry, not store the fax, dynamically expand storage for additional fee? A3.  Information is time sensitive.  Internal processes require MTF personnel to remove system on a daily/routine basis.  To date inadequate storage space has not been a problem(see expanded answer below). Expaned answer for Q1 through Q3: Inbound faxes are NOT sent by email, they are downloaded directly from a secure server, email storage is not an issue at all. The only storage issue is internal disk drive space, something that is easy to remedy and an internal issue. At Madigan we store our incoming faxes on a network drive that is access restricted to those who must have access and no one else. This provides long term archives for incoming documents and places no load on any external (I.E. Mail) servers. Bottom line there are NO STORAGE ISSUES FOR MAIL SERVERS at all, provided the established procedures for sending and processing incoming faxes are followed.
