<CONTACT>Stumpf, Lora L.
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to Cooper Power Systems, LLC (Eaton) to purchase testing and evaluation services of a transformer.  This is considered a sole source to Cooper Power Systems because, to the best of the NETL’s knowledge based on market research, conducted Cooper Power Systems is the sole source provider of this particular testing and therefore the only known source that can provide this exact service.  Cooper Power Systems/Eaton has unique facilities for transformer testing, established standardized test facilities, and existing commercial transformer products to be leveraged in providing the service requested. Due to the unique requirements for integration of the NETL developed hardware into the transformer component, Cooper Power Systems/Eaton is the only vendor capable of integrating the hardware into an operational transformer and testing the transformer under industry standard heat run conditions.  No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy NETL's requirement.  
 
This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal.  Any interested party that believes it is capable of meeting the NETL requirement described herein may identify themselves and must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill the requirement being requested by 4:30 PM ET on September 24, 2018.  Responses must be submitted in writing to the purchasing agent, Lora Stumpf, via email at stumpf@netl.doe.gov no later than the time and date noted above. Telephone responses and requests will not be received. 
 
A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<RESPDATE>092418
<ARCHDATE>10092018
<CONTACT>Stumpf, Lora L.
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to RBD Instruments for disassembly, transport, and reassembly of the PHI UHV system.  This is considered a sole source to RBD Instruments because, to the best of the NETL’s knowledge based on market research conducted, RBD Instruments is the sole source provider for this service and products associated and therefore the only known source that can provide this exact service.  RBD is the only company capable of disassembly, transport, and reassembly of the PHI-5600 XPS from the Pittsburgh, PA, site to the Morgantown, WV, site.  This service will be performed by RBD personnel and will include replacement and/or repair of non-operational components and the transfer of better components on the existing unit to another unit to provide a better overall UHV system.   No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy NETL's requirement.  
 
This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal.  Any interested party that believes it is capable of meeting the NETL requirement described herein may identify themselves and must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill the requirement being requested by 4:30 PM ET on September 24, 2018.  Responses must be submitted in writing to the purchasing agent, Lora Stumpf, via email at stumpf@netl.doe.gov no later than the time and date noted above. Telephone responses and requests will not be received. 
 
A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to enter into a sole source contract with Corys Thunder Inc for Provision of stand-Alone BWR Severe Accident Simulator Maintenance Environment. The authority to enter into a contract on a sole-source basis with GRTA is made under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.106-1 (b) which provides the contracting officer may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 (Engineering Services). This notice of intent is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) conducts reactor technology training and research activities using simulators located at the Technical Training Center (TTC) in Chattanooga, TN. Two of the simulators have the capability to host severe accident simulations and are referenced as Severe Accident Simulator (SAS) 1 and 2. Each SAS hosts two technology types, a boiling water reactor (BWR) and a pressurized water reactor (PWR) severe accident simulator which are referenced as the BWR SAS and the PWR SAS respectively. Each technology type SAS is a full-scope simulator with core, reactor coolant system, balance of plant, and containment models. Cory's Thunder Inc. (CTI) and MELCOR modeling formalisms are used to calculate normal and accident plant conditions. A Unity 3D visualization tool is used to graphically represent accident conditions in the reactor vessel. The SAS models are controlled, operated, and in part maintained using various vintages of CTI simulation tool sets. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on requirement that BWR SAS is proprietary to Corys Thunder Inc (CTI) and only CTI can provide the associated upgrade and support for their product.<br />Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the NRC's needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the below address not later than the response date that appears in the Federal Business Opportunities. Telephonic responses and responses providing insufficient information for evaluation by the NRC will not be considered.<br />

<p>1. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>2. Solicitation number is N32205-18-Q-1041 and is being issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ).</p>
<p>3. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-100, effective 22 Aug 2018.</p>
<p>4. The associated NAICS code is 611430 this procurement: Professional and Management Development Training</p>
<p>0 is not being set-aside for small businesses.<br /><br />1 is being set-aside for small businesses. The small business size standard is. $11.0 Mill</p>
<p>5. Military Sealift Command (MSC), Norfolk, VA intends to award a Firm Fixed Price purchase order for the following development of a Medical Trauma Computer Based Training Curriculum program.</p>
<p>6. Statement of Work (SOW)</p>
<p><br />Medical Trauma Computer Based Training <br />Statement of Work (SOW)<br />Background<br />Currently there is no sustainment medical trauma training offered by Afloat Training Group (ATG) or Military Sealift Command's (MSC) Afloat Training Team (ATT) (reference (a)). ATT's First Aide Training is conducted onboard all MSC Ship Fleet vessels every two years (reference (b)). Shipboard training does not ensure that the individual Civilian Mariners (CIVMAR) will receive the training on a frequent and consistent basis to maximize fleet medical readiness for phase one operations. Force Medical received funding approval to develop an Afloat Trauma Training program to train CIVMARS on how to perform self-care and buddy-care in the event an MSC vessel is attacked by an adversary.<br />Issue<br />The Force Medical Department is requesting the development of Medical Trauma Computer Based Training for the DoD which will aid in training for CIVMARS aboard MSC ships. Specifically, MSC is requesting that the trauma training shall be based on the Navy's approved Afloat Training Group (ATG) Fleet Standard of Merit (FSOM) training requirements for the eleven war wounds to ensure standard of care is the same for USNS and USS ships (reference (c)). This proposed training needs to be computer-based and address long-standing gaps in combat casualty care. The automated training will be a web-based curriculum consisting of review and testing. The training shall be structured to meet or exceed requirements as outlined in references (a) through (d). <br />Requirements<br />1. The medical trauma training program shall be composed of one Computer Based Training (CBT) program that includes the 11 modules. The first component shall focus on the operational trauma training needs of medical services officers. The second component shall focus on the translation of the DC 105 and 302 Personnel Qualification Standards (PQS) that are used to train crew-members upon all active duty sea vessels (reference (d)). The DC 105 and 302 PQS provides a basic foundation for non-medical crew members to safely and effectively respond and manage a trauma situation on land or at sea. The second component's target audience is the CIVMARS aboard ship. <br />2. Once the contract is awarded, the contractor shall have nine months to provide a CBT trauma training program that meets all of the requirements in this statement of work (SOW). The contractor shall provide a monthly interim progress review which demonstrates achievement of the objectives. The contractor shall build both programs as described in paragraph one within nine months. The Government will provide the contractor with the reference documents and guidance from ATG. The contractor will also be able to source current evidence from the Institute for Surgical Research or other DOD instructions for consultation with MSC N02H stakeholders for consideration. <br />3. The contractor shall provide a stand-alone web based CBT which upon approval and acceptance will be hosted on the Total Workforce Management Services (TWMS) portal that will allow access to Government and CIVMARS personnel. The contractor shall provide an CBT which will allow CIVMARS the ability to access from a government computer or their personal smart phones, tablets, and computers so the content is easily leveraged. MSC shall maintain data rights to the materials, training results and access.<br />4. The contractor shall select appropriate content for the Medical Service Officer (MSO) Train the Trainer Program and use a self-study format to gain foundational knowledge. The contractor shall also develop buddy-care and self-care training and testing instruments for CIVMARS that use the above mentioned materials, accessible through the Government portal.<br />5. The contractor is required to develop modules that use game-based learning in medical education to improve learning and retention. Learning occurs through the repeated use of materials that use games that will require the learner to scores 100 percent of the questions correctly or mastery level learning (or defined by a percentage correct only slightly lower). This type of learning process has been shown in some studies to promote a longer retention of the content "learned" especially when coupled with deliberative practice. <br />6. Content of deliverable shall follow DC PQS 105 and DC PQS 302 summarized below (reference (c)): A monthly interim progress review shall be provided that demonstrate the achievements of the objectives for supportive training identified in "MSC Trauma Training Content" and "interim steps" as identified below in the SOW. A monthly progress report will reference the web-based program development for the 11 independent modules, course curriculum content/objectives and web-based supportive access that shall be presented to the customer for review and approval (reference Table 1)). <br />Medical Trauma Training Deliverables"<br />MSC Trauma Training Content<br />The contractor will develop 11 independent modules on each of the following topics:<br />1. Puncture Penetrating Wound<br />2. Sucking Chest Wound<br />3. Abdominal Evisceration<br />4. Massive Hemorrhage with Amputation<br />5. Laceration<br />6. Fractures<br />7. Burns<br />8. Hypothermia<br />9. Heat Stress<br />10. Electrical Shock<br />11. Smoke Inhalation<br />Each module shall contain instructions consisting of text and audio, with a mixture of video, pictures, and animations to support the information being presented. Intermediate game-like assessments will be injected to ensure user engagement and reinforce the content. The learning module is based on each module containing 15-30 minutes of training time.</p>
<p>Interactive Assessments<br />Following each instructional module, the users will be required to take an interactive assessment. The below list contains representative scenarios. <br />1. Puncture/Penetrating Wound: While running through a passageway, a sailor trips on a watertight door and falls impaling a pencil into the left deltoid.<br />2. Sucking Chest Wound: Casualty tripped and landed on his marlin spike and went through his chest.<br />3. Abdominal Evisceration: While in the forecastle the mooring line snapped and hit the casualty in the abdomen.<br />4. Massive Hemorrhage with Amputation: While weighing the anchor, the casualty got his hand stuck in moving parts and lost his right hand.<br />5. Laceration: While the Deck Department was waiting for morning quarters, Sailor ONE was horse playing with Sailor TWO, and Sailor ONE fell and cut his left lower jaw open.<br />6. Fractures: Casualty was walking through the forecastle and tripped on a chain and landed on his left leg.<br />7. Burns: While conducting hot work, a sailor suffered a second degree burn to front and back of their right forearm.<br />8. Hypothermia: While top-side watch, a sailor becomes unresponsive and presents with signs and symptoms of hypothermia. When watch standers respond, MTT will verbally disclose signs and symptoms of hypothermia to watch standers to provoke treatment.<br />9. Heat Stress: While working out on the flight deck, a sailor collapses and presents with signs and symptoms of Heat Exhaustion. When watch standers respond, MTT will verbally disclose signs and symptoms to watch standers to provoke treatment.<br />10. Electrical Shock: While in the forecastle, the wild cat operating console short circuited and the casualty suffered an electrical shock.<br />11. Smoke Inhalation: After the short circuit in the forecastle, white smoke rapidly filled the space causing a casualty to have difficulty seeing, difficulty breathing, and coughing.<br />The Trauma Training CBT shall provide the coordination of current state simulation training data to assist in the completion of the knowledge based training. The MSO and/or ATT staff should coach NOT teach the students. This is the time for MSOs and/or ATT staff to fine tune and practice skill training support with the CIVMARS. CIVMARS will need multiple practice opportunities for each activity to gain cognitive memory related to good technique. <br />7. MSC requires that the product shall be completed and delivered within 9 months after the contract is awarded. Before the contract is delivered, MSC requires that the following interim steps are verified before the delivery date. The contractor shall provide a draft script for deliverable 0001-0005 inclusive of all modules that list dialog, setting, scenario, animation ideas, learning objectives test question and answer, and all other desired information. The draft shall be provided to the Government in Microsoft word or any other format approve by the specified Government representative for approval. This draft script will be reviewed and approved by the Government prior to beginning creation of the actual end product. <br />&bull; MSC SME review and approval of course curriculum content/objectives<br />&bull; Low-bandwidth functionality/accessibility for the host training site/training site.<br />&bull; MSC SME review and testing of content and materials<br />&bull; Contractor validates/provides statistics/metrics reporting capabilities</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure. (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.
