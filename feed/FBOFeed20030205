<DESC>The Upper Colorado Regional Office of the Bureau of Reclamation announces the solicitation of the Simplified Acquisition of Basic Engineering Requirements (SABER) - Misc. Work contract.  The government contemplates the solicitation and award of an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  This acquisition is restricted to SBA certified Hubzone firms.  Typical delivery orders will consist of a broad range of maintenance, repair and minor construction work on real property at locations within the jurisdiction of the Albuquerque Area Office, including portions of the States of Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas.  The Contractor shall perform any and all functions called for by individual delivery orders/task orders issued against this contract, for either a lump-sum price to be negotiated for each delivery order, or for the time and materials with unit prices based on the amounts awarded under this contract (time and material delivery orders shall only be issued when it is impossible to estimate the exact amount of effort required to perform the task).  The delivery order pricing will be based on the co-efficient(s) in the awarded contract multiplied by the costs in the Unit Price Book.  Historically 75 percent of the work performed under the preceding contract was for pumping operations in support of the Silvery Minnow, an Endangered Species.  The remaining 25 percent of the work was for fencing, hauling riprap, and other small construction projects.  The performance period of this contract shall consist of one base year, and four individual option years, for a total of five years.  The NAICS for this acquisition is 237990, with a size standard of $28.5M.  The estimated price range is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 if all option years are exercised.  Bid, performance and payment bonds will be required.  An electronic copy of the solicitation will be available approximately 3 March 2003 at website: www.fedbizopps.gov.  Department of the Interior has directed the use of Central Contractor Registration (CCR) as the single validated source on vendors doing business with the Government. Prospective vendors must be registered in CCR prior to the award of a contract.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Information, Central Contractor Registration Handbook and the registration process can be obtained via the CCR web site, http://www.ccr.gov. or by calling 1-888-227-2423.

<DESC>The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis a three year contract with the CDM Group on 5530 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 1600, Chevy Chase, Maryland 20815 for a project entitled "Governors' Spouses Initiative on Children and Alcohol - Phase III."  The statutory authority to negotiate with the CDM Group is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) under FAR reference 6.302-1.  The purpose of the proposed contract is to continue work begun under Phases I and II to work with various Governors' Spouses to highlight the problem and reduce the incidence of alcohol use by children and young adolescents.  The CDM Group is the only source possessing both the expertise, knowledge, and familiarity with the Initiative and Governors' Spouses on one hand, and a contractual relationship to provide Phase III services with the Initiative's other major sponsor, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation on the other.  The dual sponsorship arrangement requires that both sponsors use the same contractor. Inquiries must be made in writing; telephone inquiries are unacceptable.  See Note Number 22.  It is anticipated that the proposal will be due on or about 7 March 2003.*****

<DESC>SYNOPSIS-INDUCTIVE FUZE SETTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in  accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional  information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only  solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not  be issued. The solicitation number is RFQ # DAAE30-03-Q-0817. This solicitation  is a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated  provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular  (01-12). The NAICS code is 541511 and the small business size standard is  $  21.0 M. There are two (2) contract line items: 0001 Generate software code; and  0002 Delivery of reports. The US Army TACOM-ARDEC, Picatinny Arsenal has the  following requirement: SCOPE/OBJECTIVE: The contractor shall generate software  code in support of the Excalibur programs inductive fuze setter development.   The software code is required to enable the Excaliburs Platform Interface Kit  (PIK) to communicate with the Enhanced Portable Inductive Artillery Fuze Setter  (EPIAFS), and transfer of both Excalibur and standard artillery fuze data.  REQUIREMENTS: This effort is needed to support Army inductive fuze setter to  Excalibur munition interface development, which is an Army responsibility.   Failure to conduct this effort would result in a significant delay of the  Armys development of the EPIAFS and PIK systems.  This would prevent the Army  from being able to verify data set of the Excalibur munition - which could lead  to an inaccurate assessment of an Excalibur contractors hardware performance.  ENGINEERING SUPPORT: The contractor shall generate C++ language and cross- compile code using the GNU g++ compiler on a desktop PC running Red Hat Linux  7.2.  This will require creating software classes and methods that will allow  the PIK main software module to send data to, receive data from, and control  the EPIAFS.   The compiled and linked executable code will be downloaded via  Ethernet to the ADS Graphics Master (or Graphics Client) to be run, debugged  and tested.  All algorithms, logic, and code must conform to the draft PIK to  EPIAFS ICD and AOP22 of Stanag 4369. On the EPIAFS side, the contractor will  write code in the C language using the P&E Integrated Development Environment.   This will require creating software functions that will allow the EPIAFS main  software module to send data to, receive data from, and be controlled by the  PIK.  The contractor will also have to add new menus and new text to those  menus to reflect the use of the Excalibur.  Other software routines will be  added including an auto-adjust feature for standard fuzes, an upgrade to the  battery gage, software upgrade capability using the Monitor ROM feature, and  coil tune and power level parameters added to standard fuzes.  The code shall  be compiled using the Cosmic compiler, then downloaded to the Motorola MMDS  emulator.  On the emulator the code shall be run and debugged using the  Motorola MMDS debugger. Once the code is fully functional and tested the code  will be burned into a MC68HC908AZ60 microcontroller.  All algorithms, logic and  code must conform to the draft PIK to EPIAFS ICD and AOP22 of Stanag 4369.  Both sides of the software interface shall be tested to demonstrate the  communication between the PIK and EPIAFS, and a successful set of the  projectile interface tester when demonstrating the setting of the Excalibur.  Both sides of the software interface shall be tested to demonstrate the  communication between the PIK and EPIAFS, and a successful set of the M782,  M762, and M767 when demonstrating setting standard artillery fuzes.  A logic  analyzer and data traffic logs shall be used to demonstrate proper  communication between the PIK and EPIAFS. SCHEDULE: This task to start March 7,  2003 and is to be completed within 28 weeks, by September 19, 2003. LOCATION OF  EFFORT: This effort will be conducted at the Fuze Division of TACOM-ARDEC at  the Adelphi Laboratory Center in Adelphi MD. DELIVERIES / REPORTS: The  contractor shall deliver source code for the PIK in both printed and electronic  text format.  The source code will include comments that describe what each  class and each method within the class do. The contractor shall also deliver  source code for the EPIAFS in both printed and electronic text format.  The  source code will include comments that describe what each function does. The  effort shall be summarized in a summary report at the completion of the task.   The report shall contain a summary of the overall software modules concept for  both the EPIAFS and the PIK, a description of how the classes and methods  relate and interact with on another, the testing performed, a list of any bugs  or deficiencies, and a description of any additional work that should be  performed. The contractor shall submit, on a weekly basis, a one-paragraph  summary of work accomplished that week, and may be requested to provide summary  briefings on an as-needed basis. EVALUATION CRITERIA: Lowest price technically  acceptable quote.. Quotations are due by 1600 hours Feb.20, 2003 and can be  sent by facsimile, electronic mail or mailed to US Army TACOM-ARDEC, AMSTA-AQ- APH, Bldg. 9, Attn: Paul Fiorello or Cynthia Schoner, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ  07806-5000. E-mail address: pfiorel@pica.army.mil or cschoner@pica.army.mil,  Fax # 973-724-5484. The proposed contract action is for services for which the  Government intends to obtain on a sole source basis the services of Mark  Horvath Consulting under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, avoidance of duplication  of cost and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. This  notice does not constitute an RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by  the Government. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-  Commercial, applies to this acquisition. Include a completed copy of the  provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial  items, with quote .

<SOLNBR>DASW01-03-R-9998
<RESPDATE>022003
<ARCHDATE>04212003
<CONTACT>Jeannette Jordan, 703-697-1274
<DESC>NA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION Department of Defense Traffic Management  January 9, 2003 1.  Purpose    a.  The Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Logistics Systems Management), in coordination with the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Transportation Policy), are working together to assess and align key defense transportation systems ar chitectures with the Department of Defense (DoD) Enterprise Architecture.   b.  The objective of this Request For Information (RFI) is to obtain information to better understand commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and government off-the-shelf (GOTS) products and process capabilities that are available to provide DoD transportation off ices with the processes and system capabilities required to optimally move cargo throughout the worldwide Defense Transportation System (DTS).   c.  The DoD seeks to determine whether COTS and/or GOTS solutions and associated processes can singularly, or in part, meet future DoD traffic management technical and operational requirements relating to the movement of cargo. 2.  Scope a.  The scope of this RFI pertains to the functional and operational capabilities of existing COTS and GOTS traffic management solutions and the technical (i.e., architectural) environment in which these solutions operate.   b.  DoD seeks and encourages responses from both vendors and GOTS Program Management Offices (PMO) that currently provide traffic management products.  DoD requests that even vendors of solutions that provide only a portion of the required capabilities (as  presented in this RFI) respond.  It is important for DoD to understand product core capabilities and whether they fit as a modular component within a larger traffic management solution. 3.  Background   a.  DTS Profile.  The DoD is a high volume, high transaction shipping activity that executes over one million shipments annually.  The DTS supports day-to-day peacetime operations and scheduled exercises as well as contingency operations during times of cr ises.  The DTS operates in accordance with the Defense Transportation Regulations (DTR) (http://public.transcom.mil/J4/j4lt/dtr.html).  Regulations pertaining specifically to cargo movement are documented in Part II of the DTR.  Please reference the DTR, P art II, to understand the regulatory environment in which todays DTS operates.  The DoD maintains over 594 DoD shipping activities throughout the world and conducts approximately ten billion dollars worth of business annually, of which about half is assoc iated with cargo movements and traffic management.  In addition to organic moves, the DoD also maintains contracts with approximately 470 commercial carriers across all modes of transportation. b.  Technical Environment.  The DTS requires a web-enabled traffic management system for receiving, distributing, and processing transportation-related information at DoD transportation offices located throughout the world.  Some transportation offices mai ntain constant network and Internet connectivity.  Other transportation offices operate in locations where network and Internet connectivity is intermittent and of poor quality.  In addition, based on todays processes, DoD traffic management systems maint ain a significant number of system interfaces, each having multiple interface agreements/requirements. 4.  Targeted End-State  The DTS seeks to establish a traffic management operational environment comprised of industry proven transportation management best practices characterized by the following:   	Web-enabled, user friendly capable 	Networked or stand-alone modes capable 	Shared data environment 	Systems integrated with trading partner systems (e.g., carriers, financial systems, DoD tracking systems, DoD operations planning systems, etc.) 	Elimination of legacy DoD-unique processes and documents as applicable 	Leveraged use of Automatic Identification Technologies (AIT) 5.  RFI Structure  This RFI contains a qual itative component called General Questionnaire and a quantitative component called RFI Quantitative.xls.  The qualitative component seeks to understand high-level corporate and product information, while the quantitative component seeks to understand produ ct or solution specific capabilities.    6. Instructions to Respondents  Respondents are requested to complete both the qualitative and quantitative components in accordance with the instructions set forth below.  Please go to the Defense Contracting Command  Washington site at http://dccw.hqda. pentagon.mil/tran.htm to access all RFI documents and references. a.  Qualitative Component, General Questionnaire.  The General Questionnaire gathers qualitative-type information regarding your organization, product, and services you provide.  Please answer the questions by typing in the non-shaded cells of the table lo cated at http://dccw.hqda.pentagon.mil/tran.htm.  Please do not type your answers in the shaded cells.  You may include brief descriptions (paragraph or short bulleted list) of your product capabilities, and/or you may provide specific page and paragraph r eferences to product literature that you include with your response.  When completing the General Questionnaire, please save it in the following naming format: RFI Qualitative_{insert company name here}.doc. b.  Quantitative Component (located at http://dccw.hqda.pentagon.mil/tran.htm and called RFI Quantitative.xls).  Please note that these instructions are also provided within the spreadsheet file itself.  The spreadsheet contains specific capabilities-orien ted questions that will help DoD understand the extent to which your product meets DTS functional, operational, and technical requirements.  The sections to be completed by your company are as follows:   Functional Requirements 	Management and Decision Support Analysis (Tab 1.0) 	Outbound (Tab 2.0) 	Inbound  (Tab 3.0) Operational  	Data Acquisition (Tab 4.0 and 5.0) 	General Operational (Tab 4.0 and 5.0) Technical 	Technical / Regulatory (Tab 6.0) 1.  Various functional/capability statements are provided within each of these categories.  Please respond to each statement by selecting Yes, No, Future, 3rd Party, or Custom from the drop down list to the right of the requirement statement (in the Respon se column).  The Yes, No, Future, 3rd Party, or Custom designations should be applied as follows:  Yes	Application functionality is currently included in the base product. No	Application functionality is not currently included and will not be available in the next 12 months. Future	Application functionality is not currently included but will be available in the next 12 months. 3rd Party 	Functionality is provided by a third party partnering arrangement.  Custom	Functionality is not included in the base product today; however, can be provided by customizing or modifying the base product.  These changes will also be incorporated into the base product. NOTE: Please be specific as to the functionality available in the software release currently available to your customer base.  If functionality is to be provided in a future software release (i.e., Future), please provide the date for its planned availabil ity. There is also a Comments column in the spreadsheet where you may provide additional information to each functional/capability statement that you deem necessary and appropriate.   2.  The spreadsheet also includes a Reference Dictionary that provides links to current DoD policies, regulations, documents, and system interface formats that establish many of the requirements unique to the DTS as it operates today.  These references wil l help you understand the current DTS environment.  It is not intended to imply that future investments in traffic management capabilities will require compliance with all of these references.  If you perceive these references as an obstacle to the process es and capabilities that your solution deliver s, request your comments include how your solution delivers the required functionality in the absence of these regulations.  The Reference Dictionary is contained in the last tab of the file (RFI Quantitative.xls). 3.  When completing the quantitative component (RFI Quantiative.xls), please save it in the following naming format: RFI Quantitative_{insert company name}.xls. 	     c.  Format and Submission.  RFI responses must be entered directly into the General Questionnaire and in the spreadsheet called TM RFI Quantitative.xls, in the format described above.  Both of these documents are located at http://dccw.hqda.pentagon. mil/tran.htm.  Responses must be submitted via e-mail as two files, RFI Qualitative_{insert company name}.doc and RFI Quantitative_{insert company name}.xls, to tm.rfi@osd.mil.   	     d.  RFI response due date.  All responses to this RFI must be electronically submitted to tm.rfi@osd.mil by 5:00 p.m. EST on January 27, 2003. 	     e.  Questions.  DoD has engaged Gartner Inc. as an independent third party evaluator to support this effort.  Gartner is an objective IT research and advisory firm independent of affiliations with software developers (e.g., COTS vendors) and system i ntegrators/ implementers.  As a result, Gartner has no current or future interests in the results of this analysis, and is able to maintain its objective status.  All responses will be treated as confidential and will not be released outside of the DoD / G artner team.  If you have any questions regarding the RFI, please direct them to Stan Maoury (703) 226-4767, Gina Woiteshek (703) 226-4847, or Rich Primus (703) 226-4835.  7.  Recoupment of Costs  The Government does not intend to pay for the information requested and will not recognize any costs associated with submission of a response to this RFI. 8.  Restrictions  Though responses to this RFI will be treated as confidential, respondents should not specify proprietary information of any kind.  The release of this RFI is for market analysis purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal  (RFP) and should not be considered a commitment of any kind by the Government to procure services.

<DESC>SUMMARY: This is a reposting of the SEP Special Projects FedBizOpps Notice, replacing the previous posting which had inadvertent characters added. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy of the Department of Energy (DOE) is anticipating the availability of financial assistance to the States for a group of special project activities. Funding is being provided by a number of programs in the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. States may apply to undertake any of the projects being offered by these programs. Financial Assistance will be awarded to the States separately for each special project, with activities to be carried out in conjunction with their efforts under SEP. The special projects' funding and activities are tracked separately so that the DOE Program Offices may follow the progress of individual projects. DATES: The program solicitation is anticipated to be posted on the Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) web site in mid-February, 2003. Applications will be due in early to mid-May, 2003. ADDRESSES: To obtain a copy of the solicitation, when released, interested parties should access the DOE Golden Field Office Home Page at http://www.golden.doe.gov/businessopportunities.html , and click on the Solicitations button. The Golden Home Page will provide a link to the solicitation in the IIPS web site and provide instructions on using IIPS. The solicitations can also be obtained directly through IIPS at http://e-center.doe.gov, when released, by browsing opportunities by Contract Activity, for those solicitations issued by the Golden Field Office. DOE will not issue paper copies of the solicitation. IIPS provides the medium for disseminating solicitations, receiving financial assistance applications, and evaluating the applications in a paperless environment. The application(s) must be submitted to IIPS by an eligible State applicant. For questions regarding the operation of IIPS, contact the IIPS Help Desk at IIPS_HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov or at (800) 683-0751. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The projects must meet the relevant requirements of the program providing the funding, as well as of the State Energy Program, as specified in the 2003 State Energy Program Special Projects Solicitation. The goals of the special projects activities are to assist States accelerate deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies; facilitate the acceptance of emerging and underutilized energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies; and increase the responsiveness of Federally funded technology development efforts to private sector needs. Fiscal Year 2003 is the eighth year special project activities have been funded in conjunction with the State Energy Program (10 CFR 420). Most of these special projects are related to or based on similar efforts that have been funded by other DOE programs. Availability of Fiscal Year 2003 Funds: With this publication, DOE is anticipating the availability of an estimated $16.3 million in new financial assistance awards from Fiscal Year 2003 appropriations. DOE's obligation for performance of this Solicitation is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which financial assistance awards can be made. The awards will be made through a competitive process. The programs that are participating in the State Energy Program Special Projects for Fiscal Year 2003, with the estimated amount of funding available for each, are as follows: o Clean Cities: The program will provide funds to support the deployment of alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) in the following four categories: 1) projects that promote acquisition of commercially-available AFVs that maximize alternative fuel use, especially when those vehicles support an AFV niche market activity center or niche deployment strategy; 2) projects that promote AFV infrastructure development; 3) Projects that promote the acquisition of AFV school buses; 4) Projects that support coalition activities ($5,000,000). o Industrial Technology Program: The objective is to broaden the impact of investments in advanced industrial technologies and practices geared toward energy savings and waste reduction. This will be done through increased partnerships composed of State agencies, universities and local small and mid-sized manufacturing entities ($2,000,000). o Building Codes and Standards: Support States' actions to adopt, update, implement, enforce and evaluate the effectiveness of their residential and commercial building energy codes ($1,650,000). o Rebuild America: Support Rebuild America State Programs which are consistent with the Rebuild America Strategic Plan that identifies specific and measurable building and related energy saving projects. The goal is for 50% of the partnerships to have completed at least one major building renovation project by 2005. The partnerships must define a program and process that would show a significant opportunity for completion of building projects ($3,000,000). o Building America: Applications should include research that coordinates with Building America's goal of creating building system performance packages that make new houses 40% to 70% more energy efficient than those built to local building code standards. Existing houses should be 30% more energy efficient than the local building code ($300,000). o Federal Energy Management Program: Applications should promote and facilitate sustainable design and construction, energy efficient operations and maintenance, distributed and renewable energy, renewable energy purchases, siting of renewable power on Federal sites, and assessment and implementation of load and energy reduction techniques ($500,000). o Solar Technology Program: To determine if islanding is a reasonable concern for distributed energy resources, grants are available to utilities to conduct measurements of the actual watts, Volt-Amp Reactives (VARs), and harmonics present on 12 distribution lines ($250,000). o State Wind Energy Support: Applications are sought for 1) State outreach and technical assistance, and 2) regional consortia on transmissions ($400,000). o Distributed Energy and Electric Reliability - Transmission Reliability, Energy Storage, and Interconnection: Applications are sought for 1) Energy Storage, Renewable Generation Dispatch, and Transmission Stability, and 2) Electrical Interconnection Regulatory Education and Outreach ($205,000). o Distributed Energy and Electric Reliability - Regional Combined Cooling Heating and Power Applications Centers: The objectives of the Regional Application Centers will be to provide essential and appropriate applied research and development support, focused on the technology transfer and deployment of advanced Combined Heat and Power (CHP) technologies. The Regional Application Centers will achieve this objective through targeted education and outreach programs as well as project assistance ($1,200,000). o Distributed Energy and Electric Reliability - High Temperature Superconductivity, State Outreach Centers: Project requests are for the development and facilitation of State meetings and workshops designed to disseminate information on the technical, economic, environmental feasibility, and effectiveness of High Temperature Superconductivity (HTS) technologies and their systems integration approach ($400,000). o Geothermal Outreach: Program funding will be provided for outreach and information sharing with State-based agricultural/rural sectors in States with direct use geothermal resources. Additional funding will be provided for projects that update the inventory of geothermal resources in a given State ($300,000). o Biomass: To foster significant penetration of biomass-based technologies and products, cost-shared proposals are sought under two broad categories 1) outreach and information transfer to consumers, farmers, and industry; or 2) Development of innovative State or local incentives that facilitate increased market penetration of bio-based products and biomass-based technologies ($600,000). o Residential Deployment: The goal of this solicitation is to develop self-sustaining energy efficiency programs for the existing home market that incorporate marketing efforts, builder training/certification, home inspections, and quality assurance of contractor work ($500,000). Restricted Eligibility: Eligible Applicants under this solicitation are limited to the 50 States, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U. S. Virgin Islands. Applications must be submitted by the State Energy Office or other agency responsible for administering the State Energy Program pursuant to 10 CFR part 420, although States may work in collaboration with non-State partners. For convenience, the term State in this solicitation refers to all eligible Applicants. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number assigned to the State Energy Program Special Projects is 81.119. Requirements for cost sharing contributions are addressed in each category. Cost sharing contributions beyond any required percentage is desirable. Evaluation Review and Criteria: A first tier review for compliance will occur at the appropriate DOE Regional Office. Applications found to be in compliance will undergo a merit review process by panels comprised of members representing the participating programs at DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. The program offices recommend projects to the Office of Weatherization and Intergovernmental Program Manager who is the designated selecting official. DOE reserves the right to fund, in whole or in part, any, all or none of the applications submitted in response to this notice.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis with Pacific Institute for Research Evaluation (PIRE), 11710 Beltsville Drive, Suite 300, Calverton, MD 20705-3102, for a contract for the "Injury and Emergency Medical Services Branch, Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB)."  This is a notice of intent, not a request for competitive proposals.

The Injury and Emergency Medical Services Branch proposes to contract with Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation (PIRE) for the purposes of providing specific skills building and technical assistance services to State and local maternal and child health agency personnel to help them improve their skills in collecting, analyzing, utilizing analytical data pertaining to injury of children and adolescents including injury reduction intervention strategies. This proposed contract would provide vital support to State and local health and safety personnel by upgrading skills and by performing state and county analyses of injury costs and the savings from injury prevention.  PIRE also will develop injury cost and cost savings analyses in support of national MCHB initiatives.

Performance of this contract requires the use of two injury cost modeling systems.  One is based on what is known as the United States Injury Cost and Consequence File, actually a set of files assembled as a proprietary file by the PIRE's Economic and Insurance Resource Center, funded over a period of years by the public and private sectors. The model has been applied to cost hospital discharge data about injury in more than 20 states.  Private funders include Lowe's Home Safety Council, the Packard Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, the National Safety Council, General Motors, and the proposed Contractor from its own funds.  Public funders include the HRSA/MCHB, the Centers for Disease Control, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Federal Highway Administration, the National Institute on Occupational Safety and Health, the National Institutes of Health and the National Institute of Justice.  This file drives a diagnosis-based injury cost model that differentiates the cost of a hospital as compared to non-hospital treatment. The model employs two medical coding systems: the International Classification of Diseases and a Two-Column Diagnosis Coding System.

The decision to award the contract to PIRE is because the work that is to be performed requires the use of proprietary software to collapse other diagnosis systems into one of these two described systems.  The proprietary software also customizes the cost of treatment to the age and gender of the victim.  For hospitalized cases it uses information that is know about the victim in the incident data set (e.g., length of a stay, payments for treatment).  The system models three dimensions of cost: medical payments, other direct and indirect costs and quality adjusted life years lost to the injury.
Therefore, the Government has determined that PIRE is the only responsible source having the experience and expertise necessary to provide the work and services required under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i).  This is not a solicitation.  A copy of the Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file.  The contact person for this acquisition is:  Frantz Y. Richard, Contracting Officer, Division of Procurement Management (DPM), OMPS/HRSA, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 13A-19, Rockville, MD 20857-5600; phone number 301-443-0687; FAX 301-443-6038.  The electronic mailing address is: frichard@hrsa.gov.  See note 22.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with Lockheed Missiles and Fire Control - Dallas (LMMFC-D), 1701 W. Marshall Drive, Grand Prairie TX 75051.  LMMFC-D is the only qualified source to conduct this effort.  There is a need for an FY03-FY05 flight test demonstration of an autonomous wide area search miniature (less than 100 lbs fueled) munition conducting an armed reconnaissance mission against mobile ground targets (Theater Missile Defense (TMD), Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD), and Armor).  Demonstration will consist of the tactical configured munition (wings stowed, engine off) launched from test aircraft, post launch wing deployment and air start its engine, and fly out under GPS/INS waypoint guidance to designated search areas.  The munition will initiate search in the first area for targets using an onboard seeker utilizing real-time autonomous target acquisition (ATA) algorithms to discriminate and properly ID mobile relocatable target vehicles.  The munition will transmit its ID/Location/BIT and all detected target ID/Location/Time to a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) operator.  It will also transmit data to simulated munitions involved in the cooperative search and attack mission.  HITL operator through an uplink to the munition will direct munitions to second search area.  Munition will initiate search to detect, discriminate and properly ID mobile relocatable target vehicles.  The munition will transmit detected target ID/Location/Time to a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) operator who will then direct the munition to engage the desired target vehicle.  Once directed to reengage a previously detected target the munition will optimize search to reengage, identify, track, and transmit engagement data (munition ID/Location/BIT and target ID/Location/Time) as it conducts a simulated attack using some means to document the warhead initiation event against a moving target (40 Km/Hr).  LMMFC-D developed the Laser Detection and Ranging (LADAR) algorithms under an Other Transaction for Prototype Agreement with AFRL/MN.  The algorithms are proprietary to LMMFC-D.  LMMFC-D is the only company that can accomplish the work to be done for a flight demonstration without substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in the continued development of this critical wide area search miniature munition technology. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested parties may submit statements of capability (SOC) demonstrating their experience with miniature munitions and the wide area autonomous search problem, and their ability to rapidly structure a demonstration flight test program.  The qualification package should include a schedule and description of how the contractor will validate demonstrated mature seeker and Autonomous Target Acquisition (ATA) performance against a variety of different Theater Missile Defense (TMD), Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD), and armored interdiction targets.  The estimated period of performance for this effort is approximately 36 months.  The tentative funding profile for this effort is estimated at $7.8M FY03, $5.3M FY04, and $0.6M FY05.  Submit within 15 days of publication, to Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL/MNK), Attn:  Linda Weisz, 101 West Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810.  For technical information contact C. Cocchiarella, AFRL/MNAV at (850) 882-4651, ext. 3382, for contractual questions contact Linda Weisz, Contracts Specialist at (850) 882-4294, ext. 3405.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station (NSWCDD CSS), Panama City, Florida, 32407-7001 intends to award a Purchase Order to North American Western Data Systems Incorporated, 14722 Regnal Street, Houston, Texas 77039-1042, on a sole source basis for 4 each Trimble GPS132, with Omnistar Differential Connections WAAS and Coast Guard Correction, 12 channel GPS with Everst MPR; 2 each Trimble GPS132, with Omnistar Differential Corrections WAAS and Coast Guard Correction, 12 channel with carrier phase output; and 2 each Trimble M750 GPS receivers. This equipment will be used to augment and upgrade the current outdated hardware/software and will allow for improved performance of the GPS Tracking and Navigation system of the Coastal Test Range. It is imperative that the equipment purchased for this upgrade be 100% backward compatible and easily integr ated with the existing hardware and software. This level of compatibility and integration are required to prevent errors in positioning and data loss during at-sea operations. Use of any other manufacturers equipment would cost the Government additional time and money while attempting to integrate the different systems that in turn would negatively impact the range schedule of tests. Thus North American Western Date System is the only vendor that can meet this requirement. A firm-fixed-price commercial item type contract is anticipated.  NAICS Code 334511 Applies. SBA Size standard 750 employees.  FSC 5825.

The purpose of this acquisition is to conduct a 36-month System Development and Demonstration (SDD) Phase for MI-RAMS Transmitters and Receivers, Deliver Product Qualification Test Samples and Low Rate Initial Production, followed by a contract for Production. This acquisition is not suitable for full and open competition because the MI- RAMS uses a magneto inductive wireless remote command signali ng system, including magneto-inductive transmitters and receivers, to control the firing of ordnance through all types of medium including salt water, earth, metal structures, etc., based on the designs and intellectual property possessed and owned by MISL.  Therefore, only MISL has the in-depth knowledge of the magneto inductive command communication and firing devices to successfully accomplish this requirement.  MISL, as the developer and manufacturer of the MI technology necessary to implement this program, owns the specific intellectual property necessary for successful performance.  NAICS Code 541710 applies. SBA Size Standard is 750 employees (based on NAICS Code 334290). FSC is 5895.

The estimated period of performance will be two (2) years with the Government reserving the right to grant extensions for up to two years, with no single extension exceeding one year in accordance with DFARS 216.703 (c).   BOA's are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) District Offices. The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southern Division (NAVY) and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of covered services, if and when ordered.  The contractor will receive contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to the extent referenced therein and according to the dollar amount of each BOA and shall constitute a separate contract with the issuance of a task order.  On a semi-annual basis, the Navy and the Small Business Administration Headquarters will review the continued need for this agreement in light of  (a) a usefulness and need for service and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors.  When the Navy has a specific work requirement suitable for accomplishment under the BOA, they will provide written plans and specifications, or in some cases a design concept only, to the contractors for submission of a proposal.  If the parties are able to come to an agreement, an contractual order will be issued and the Contractor will be required to furnish the necessary personnel, material, labor, equipment, supervision and overhead required to perform the work within the specified time allotted in the order, as directed by the Contracting Officer.  The BOA Task Orders shall be restricted to the BOA holders in the SBA Districts noted in this synopsis.  However, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition if unable to obtain adequate competition.  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement but there is a threshold minimum of not less than $100,000.00 that can be placed on a Task Order with a maximum of $3,000,000.  A project could be awarded at an amount less than $100,000.00 if all parties are in agreement.   The Contracting Officer, when awarding on a best value basis, will consider factors such as Past Performance, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach and Price.  The Contractor will be required to furnish a Bid Bond with each proposal over $25,000 with Performance and Payment Bonds required on each Task Order.   There is no assurance from the BOA of a steady stream of work.  Nothing in the BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only.  DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  The anticipated work requires a diversity of skills suitable to a variety of tasks.  Covered work includes, but is not limited to, the following types.

The agreements will be written for a period of two (2) years.  The Agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder.  If a firm is graduating from the  8(a) program by the end of each annual review of the agreement, no new orders will be issued to the Contractor and the agreement will terminate.  Termination of the agreement under those circumstances shall not have an affect on any orders previously issued.  Either party may cancel the agreement with 30 days written notice to the other party.   Any cancellation will not have any effect on previously issued task orders prior to the effective date of cancellation.  The contractor maybe required to submit a brief technical proposal or work plan and a list of proposed subcontractors for Navy approval as well as a price proposal.

The individual must have the ability and skills to: 1) work in a research setting including participation in procedure selection and protocol preparation; 2) have the ability to customize and design neuropsychological testing to meet the needs of specific NINDS protocols; 3) be familiar with a range of unusual neurological disorders, including those currently under study; and 4) generate reports and data into existing research databases; 5) neuropsychological testing including but not limited to standard tests of intelligence, personality, memory and learning for the diagnosis and treatment of adults and children in support of neuropsychological tests suited to the protocol under study in NINDS and the individual being tested, analysis and interpretation of test results and completion of a written report to be filed with the referring physician and in the medical record; 6) ability to meet requirements for NIH Clinical Center credentials as a licensed Clinical Neuropsychologist.  Dr. Wiggs is uniquely qualified to provide these services because of her extensive experience in providing neuropsychological testing, including standard tests of intelligence, personality, memory, and learning.  Dr. Wiggs has extensive experience with NIH patients and research protocols, and has specialized knowledge of the performance and interpretation of intraoperative language testing and WADA testing.  She has provided these services for the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and NINDS, and is currently involved in several NINDS intramural protocols and is very familiar with this type of work. The period of performance shall be for a period of twelve (12) months with one (1) option year.  Dr Edythe Wiggs is the only source known to NINDS that can provide these services.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, including all techniques and demonstrated expertise, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI and NINDS to determine if the party can fully meet this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on February 21, 2003.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509.

<DESC>The dam was built in 1956 and is presently in danger of breach through failure of the principal spillway joint separations.  Two other NRCS dams  built in the same rock formation in adjacent or nearly watesheds have failed ro partially failed due to internal erosion of the rock abutments through vertical relief fractures.  The purpose of the exploration is to 1) map the extent of the fracture system into the abutments and foundation of Klinkner Dam, 2) determine the spacing, width and fill material of the fractures, 3) find the bearing capacity of foundation materials that will be subjected to a greater load and 4) characterize the embankment material and material in the area of the proposed auxiliary spillway.  Due to concern regarding failure from stress relief joints a combination of angle core drilling to intersect vertical fractures and water pressure testing to learn the permeability of the rock will be used. 

Water can be drawn from Knapp Creek at a rate of 1500 gallons per hour.  The Jordan Sandstone is extremely pervious.  At a project in a nearby watershed the water takes in the Jordan Formation exceeded the pump capacity of the drill rig (60 gpm at 40 psi) through a 1-inch pipe.  There was no water return at any depth when drilling in this rock.

Pressure testing will be done on hole 6.  Additional pressure testing may be required.  The water table is expected to be near the base of the dam so some pressure testing will be below the water table.  It is likely that pressure testing intervals will be reduced to two or three feet if there is consistently no back pressure using the maximum capacity of the equipment. 

Excavation and/or fill may be necessary to ensure the drill rig is level, to provide room for the rig to be angled upstream or downstream and to provide a work area for logging and to accommodate the stand used to photograph core.  Level areas may also be required on the embankment if embankment material is extremely variable so that further test holes are needed.  Clearing and/or grubbing of brush and trees will be needed for holes on the abutments. 

Information from past work in the Jordan Sandstone Formation
Pressure testing at a dam in the adjacent watershed in the Jordan gave no back pressure in any holes at any depth (maximum 60 feet) with 60gpm at 40 psi through a 1-inch pipe.

Major items of work:  Mobilization and Demobilization; Clearing and Grubbing; Hollow Stem Sampling System 6 Ft; Rock Core Boring (Vertical) 4 Ft.; Rock Core Boring (angle) 4 Ft; Undisturbed sample (Thin wall push-tube) 3 EA; Pressure testing 5 HR.  Range of Cost is $25,000 to $100,000.  All responsible bidders can obtain a solicitation through www.fedbizopps.gov.  A Site showing is scheduled for March 3, 2003 at 10:00 AM to meet at the Viroqua Service Center.  For directions call Jeff Hastings at (608)637-5475.  A brief meeting concerning the bidding process and contract requirements, the group will tour the work site.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 562998   Market Survey/Sources Sought: The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Environmental Information's (OEI) is conducting a market survey through this FedBizOpps notification to identify companies that have the capability to provide recycling, reclamation,  and/or asset disposition services for a variety of electronics equipment; including:  personal computer desktops, laptops, printers, scanners, LAN equipment, copying machines, phones, palm pilots, cell phones, etc.  EPA is currently in the process of fulfilling an Agency requirement for the  recycling of electronic equipment and properly disposing of Agency electronic assets as part of its ongoing mission to protect the environment.  EPA recognizes that there is a Government-wide need to address an expected avalanche of obsolete electronic equipment in the near future.  In order to  enhance public health and environmental protection, OEI eventually plans to award a Recycling Electronics and Asset Disposition (READ) contract to provide the entire Federal sector with a procurement tool to recycle and properly dispose of excess or obsolete electronic personal property in an  environmentally responsible manner.  According to a study by the National Safety Council, over 30 million personal computers become obsolete each year in the U.S. alone, with higher numbers likely to follow.  EPA anticipates issuing a multiple award contract that will require contractors to perform  one or more of the following functions: (1) Refurbishing and reconfiguring electronic equipment and identifying a market to resell that equipment; (2)  Donating refurbished equipment to educational institutions or other Government Agencies per the requirements of Executive Order 12999;  (3)   Dismantling electronic equipment that has been determined to be beyond an upgrade or refurbishment.  Reclamation of  this type of equipment will involve having the ability to identify which parts can be recycled for possible use in other equipment, which parts can be resold on the market, and which  parts have no useful market value and must be properly disposed or recycled; (4)  For older equipment that has been determined to have no useful market value, the contractor will determine the proper and safe methods for disposal of the equipment, will coordinate with the Agency to obtain approval  for the method of disposal, and will be responsible for the recycling or disposal of the identified equipment; and (5) creating an audit trail on the equipments' components final location and providing certification regarding the final disposition of all electronic equipment handled by the company.   If your company has the capability to provide any of these types of services, please submit a written notification to voss.oliver@epa.gov.   In the near future, EPA will post its plans for fulfilling this requirement at www.epa.gov/oam/hpod under the Sources Sought icon, and will invite comments  on the Statement of Objectives (SOO) developed to fulfill this requirement.

<DESC>The INEEL would like to team with a thermal spray company to develop the industrial design for spraying on the inside of pipes. Recent prototype work has led to the appropriate patent applications. The INEEL is interested in supporting the development of coating the inside of geothermal pipe on a large-scale basis.
At present, titanium and nickel alloy pipe are used in the geothermal industry to meet the operational requirements.  The DOE Geothermal Program is investigating the use of thermal spray coatings on carbon steel as a substitute for alloy pipe.
The INEEL would be interested in developing the fabrication specification and operational requirements for an internal pipe spraying system for the purposes of applying metallic corrosion resistant coatings.  
The spraying capability needs to be flexible so that a choice can be made between wire arc, plasma spray or HVOF mechanisms. The system must remotely apply several layers of coating evenly on the inside of a 10-inch ID pipe that is 80 ft long. This can be viewed as spraying from each end for 40 ft. The system must remotely perform surface preparation before coating and removal of particulate during the spray operation.
The coating must meet standard industrial quality requirements for consistency and durability. The system must be able to operate in a field environment such as at a pipe mill in a timely fashion as to not impact operations. This is approximately 30 minutes for each 80 ft pipe length.
Interested companies that can demonstrate the capital resources for field application should contact Karen Moore, INEEL, PO Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415   (208) 526-8852, E-Mail: gia@inel.gov or David R. Anderson PO Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415, (208) 526-0837, E-Mail: andedr2@inel.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

STATEMENT OF WORK

INTRODUCTION:
This statement of work is intended to provide a high level description of the scope of work and proposed cost for developing software for BLS IVR Applications.
APPLICATION:
Index Scripts, Error Event Script, and Fax on Demand

INDEX SCRIPT:
Write a FTP script, which will allow it to load a flat file (IVR_OUT.TXT) from floppy disks.  This flat file will be used for populating the statistical information throughout the script screens.  Each day at 8:35:00 AM this script will be executed to capture a flat file from floppy disks or designated directory.  The date/time stamp of this file will be checked every minute for the next 30 minutes for any changes.  This data will be loaded into a local Oracle database, which will be used by the scripts.

ERROR EVENT SCRIPT:
The script will be written in case a major event might occur.  The customer will need to execute this to turn on/off the application in order to further continue with the normal procedures or to execute error logic.

INDEX SCRIPT APPLICATION:
This application provides the caller with Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) economic data.  The caller will also have the option to have a copy of the script faxed to them. The caller will be able to navigate via the menu or select an option to speak to an Information Specialist.  Each selection will check the values in the table for positive, negative or no change in the monthly and yearly % change fields and to read the appropriate text message to the caller.  The application will perform a blind transfer to a specified VDN, if the caller opts to get transferred to CSR.

FAX ON DEMAND APPLICATION:
Application will allow callers to provide a 4-digit document code or request a catalog.  A maximum of 4 documents can be faxed per call.  These documents will be faxed to the callers fax number, which would be collected from the caller.
ASSUMPTIONS:
It is the responsibility of the customer to provide files, which will be faxed in TIFF/Text format.  The files will be stored in separate directories on the Conversant in TIFF format.  Directories will contain the code number since most documents are multiple pages.

The information needed by the index script will be available from the local Oracle database.  If another external interface is required, HCI reserves the right to modify the prices accordingly.

The datetab.txt file is updated on a yearly basis.  It will need to be loaded into the application by a script.  

INTERFACE(DIP):
Not applicable, local Oracle databases will be used.
NETWORK:
The IVR will not be place on the LAN.  All documents and files will be loaded from floppy disks.
ORACLE LICENSES:
Licenses for the remote Oracle database(s) are the responsibility of the customer.
LANGUAGE:
The application(s) will be developed in English only.
INSTALLATION:
Installation will be done remotely.  The Conversant system requires a modem and telephone (dial in) line.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions from potential offerors.

Question 1: "Will the unit be operated with depth below the sensor considered shallow water (100 or less below the sensor or thereabouts), or is this intended to be used to collect data in a deep regime as well?"

ANSWER: The 3000 meter depth rating is the maximum operating depth of the Deep Towed Vehicle. The system will be integrated into the deep towed vehicle. The "operating regime" of the system will perform to the limits of a 200Khz system.

Question 2: "Spec 1.d. is misleading. Is this meant to be PRF which is duplicated in spec 1.e. or is this a reference to towed body altitude measurement?"

ANSWER:  Spec 1.d. requires that the received signal be sampled as a function of range (in this case this also means time) at a required rate of at least 10 kHz.  

Question 3: "1.e. asks for a max ping rate of 10 pps. Why would the ping rate be limited to 10 pps?" 

ANSWER: The sonar shall be capable of pinging at least 10 times per second.

Question 4:  (a) "Is there a specific reason for requiring 111 beams in 1.f.?" (b) "You are requiring adjustable sectors and a 2.0x1.5 beam width, so what relevancy does the number of beams have?" (c) "Would 130 be satisfactory given all other parameters are met?"

ANSWER: (a) The focus of this spec is on the number of beams or bathymetric data points per 120 degree sector when the sonar is operating in variable swath width mode (depth below sonar, number of beams control the width of the bathymetric swath). (b) The Government desires 110 to 120 beams over the 120 sectors when operated in this mode. (c) Yes

Question 5: "The ability to maintain all beams as spec'd in 1.j. is a very broad requirement. Will the vehicle be operated at 5000m above the bottom?"

ANSWER: The Government requires the variable swath mode mentioned in response to 4(a) above, and for the system capable of operation in a fixed swath width mode in which the beams are automatically modified to produce a constant swath independent of the depth of the towfish over the sea floor. Reference response to question 1.

Question 6: "A center frequency of 200 kHz is specified. Is this based upon operating depth considerations or feature resolving capability? If the system met all specs at 300 kHz would this violate your specifications?"

ANSWER: The 200 kHz center frequency is based on feature resolving capability and operating altitude (20m to 150m) considerations (sonar range, swath width etc).   It is also based on the fact that specification 1m requires that the multibeam sonar will be operated at the same time as the existing Edge Tech dual frequency (100/400 KHz) sidescan sonar.  A 200 KHz is proportionately further away from 400 KHz in frequency space than a 300 kHz system and thus less likely to interfere with the sidescan.  A 300 Khz system is thus not optimum in the sense that its measurement range is limited and could interfere with the sidescan.

Question 7: "Finally (and forgive me if it's in there) I can't find from the write-up if this is fixed-price or time/materials, etc.?"

ANSWER: This is an acquisition for a commercial item and in accordance with FAR Part 12, it is anticipated that any resulting contract will be firm-fixed-price.

<DESC>100% SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.  

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is planning to issue an RFP for an Indefinite-Quantity, Indefinite-Delivery (IDIQ) Task Order contract for a Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center (SCCC) for the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN).  The RFP will be a 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541710 and the corresponding small business size standard is 500 employees or less.

The NIH, NICHD is the lead Federal agency for the conduct of basic, clinical and epidemiological research to develop new contraceptives and to evaluate existing methods of contraception and reproductive health.  The Center for Population Research (CPR), within NICHD, was established in 1968 by the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare, with the important goal of developing new contraceptives through the use of contracts and grants. Within CPR, the Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch (CRHB) has long supported several preclinical contraceptive testing facilities, as well as facilities for chemical and peptide synthesis.  To further expand their contraceptive development capabilities, in 1996 CRHB established the initial NICHD CCTN in order to conduct Phase I, II, and III clinical trials of new female contraceptive methods.  

The SCCC for the NICHD CCTN is an important component of the CRHB contraceptive development capability.  Products that have undergone formulation and successful pre-clinical testing, either through the CRHB formulation and testing facilities or through outside sources, are candidates for clinical testing in the CCTN.  The CCTN is particularly valuable for providing a venue for testing new contraceptive drugs and devices that have been developed by small companies that lack the resources to support large-scale clinical trials. This acquisition will be a recompetition of the SCCC for the CCTN that has been funded under a Cost plus Fixed Fee contract since 1996. 

The proposed SCCC, operating under an Indefinite-Quantity, Indefinite-Delivery (IDIQ) Task Order contract, will be able to work with the CCTN contractors to rapidly develop protocols and initiate clinical trials shortly after candidate products have completed the necessary preclinical testing.  The resultant IDIQ contract will consist of a one-year base period and six one-year option periods. The SCCC Contractor will provide necessary technical support needed by the NICHD and the CCTN sites, such as the development of research protocols, on-site monitoring of clinical trials, the statistical analysis of data from these trials, and the development of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications and initiation of New Drug Applications (NDA); and for a devices, Premarket notifications 510k, Premarket approvals (PMA), and Investigation Device Exemptions (IDE).

It is estimated that the new NICHD CCTN will consist of approximately 12 sites capable of performing female contraceptive clinical trials and approximately four sites capable of performing male contraceptive clinical trials.  Please be advised that the NICHD is issuing separate RFPs for each CCTN Topic Area (Female Contraceptive Clinical Trials & Male Contraceptive Clinical Trials) and the SCCC for the CCTN in order to better facilitate and coordinate the evaluation of Proposals.  This announcement is for the RFP for the SCCC for the NICHD CCTN, only. 

Small business concerns that believe they have the capabilities necessary to serve as the Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center for the NICHD's Contraceptive Clinical trials Network may access the Request for Proposal(s), RFP-NICHD-2003-01, electronically on the FedBizOpps website, at http://www.eps.gov/spg/HHS/NIH/NICHD/postdate_1.html, on or about December 1, 2002.

Delivery of Upgrades - Notwithstanding the delivery requirements set forth above, initial delivery requirements for upgraded items shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties to this contract at the time the upgrade item is added. The Contracting Officer shall have the right to set the delivery schedule based on the longer of the standard commercial delivery schedule of the item(s) or the contract's standard delivery schedule for similar item(s), if a mutually agreeable schedule cannot be met. After the first 60 days, the original contract schedule for delivery takes effect if it is less than the initial agreed upon delivery time. Identification of Technologically Advanced Products - While the Government reserves the right to independently solicit a proposal from the Contractor under the terms of this clause at any time, potential upgrades will normally be brought to the attention of the Government by the Contractor. Offers shall be submitted on an SF-1449 and are due by close of business on February 10, 2003. Please submit any questions, in writing, by January 30, 2003 to Karen Smith at the following facsimile number - (202) 324-5722.

The required space must be within Prince George's County, Maryland within the following delineated area:

North: Central Avenue - Route 214

East: Largo Road - Route 202

South: Ritchie White Road

<DESC>NA Demonstration of a transcritical carbon dioxide cycle in a packaged-unitary heat pump (ECU) designed for military working conditions, and demonstration of the same transcritical carbon dioxide cycle in the conversion of a government-furnished HMMWV. The U. S. Army requires advanced heating and cooling technology for a variety of equipment applications.  One of these is the military family of Environmental Control Units (ECUs), and another is for light tactical vehicles  such as the High-Mobility Multi-purpos e Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs).  High performance systems with  reduced logistics support requirements and environmentally responsible working fluids are desired.  Of specific  interest is implementing technology for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.   The transcritical carbon  dioxide cycle offers these possibilities.  The scope of the efforts under this proposed effort will include the development of major system components such as compressors, heat exchangers, and controls to the extent required, an d fabrication and test of full-scale demonstration prototypes.  Modeling and simulation and/or laboratory bench testing are acceptable to the degree necessary.  The U. S. Army is interested in receiving white papers outlining proposed research and developm ent of CO2 demonstration systems for both of the above two applications.  the Army intends to obtain R&D for  both applications from a single source.  White papers should be limited to no more than five (5) pages and should  include a summary of related co rporate experience, and a specific development plan for the two desired  applications.  Sufficient technical details should be provided so that the intended technical approach is clearly  evident, including at a minimum the specific thermodynamic cycle to be employed, components to be incorporated, and anticipated performance objectives.  Sufficient scheduling information shall be provided to allow the Army to evaluate timeliness of proposed R&D.  Emphasis will be placed on prospective sources with proven e xperience in building and testing full-scale prototype vehicles with transcritical CO2 systems, AND demonstrated  experience in component design, fabrication, and test for prototype ECUs using CO2 technology.  Experience in performing and/or directing rece nt and relatable laboratory research efforts in CO2 theoretical or experimental  test and evaluation is also desired.  Emphasis will be placed on accelerated program schedules.  The Army desires delivery of the converted HMMWV within 120-days after contrac t award and delivery of the ECUs within 12-months after contract award.  White papers should be submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer at peggy.melanson@cacw.army.mil by 19 February 2003.  All requests for further information must be in writin g or via email, telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.

The services provided to CAFS by the Contractor will be continuous and ongoing.  A schedule will be established that maintains adequate solid waste storage at the facility and meets facility operating requirements. Installation Description; CAFS is located approximately 78 miles southwest of Fairbanks, Alaska on the George Park?s Highway.  The primary mission at CAFS is to collect Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) data.  The secondary mission is to track satellites and space debris.  The facilities at CAFS support this mission.  The facilities at CAFS are shown on Figure 2.  The Composite Area includes administration offices (Building 201 and 202), personnel quarters (Buildings 203-204), supply (Building 250 and 252), CAFS Fire Department (Building 251), and vehicle maintenance (Building 196).  The Camp Area buildings include Civil Engineering offices, shops, and storage buildings, auxiliary dorm buildings, and Security Forces.  The coal-fired power plant produces the electricity and heat for the site and includes Buildings 111 to 115.  The current radar system, the Solid State Phased-Array Radar System (SSPARS), is located in Building 800.  One office in building 101 (PMEL) and one office in building 102 (JRCS) are still occupied ten hours a day by a total of five people each day, Monday through Friday.  Otherwise, buildings 101 through 106 are no longer occupied.  Solid Waste Generation and Storage; CAFS employs approximately 80 military personnel, 50 civil service personnel, and 200 contractors.

Because of the small capacity of the Dumpsters, some areas maintain multiple Dumpsters for solid waste storage.  The Dumpsters are eight-yard flat top, front-loading containers manufactured by the Cascade Container-Fab Company, a Division of McLestkey Enterprises, Inc. and located at 26406 NW 19th Avenue, Ridgefield, WA  98642 (1-800-628-8722).  The Dumpsters have outside dimensions of 80-inch length, 72-inch width, and 75-inch height.  The fork holes run the depth of the Dumpster and are 9 inches high by 4 inches wide.
