<DESC><p>Notice of Intent to Sole Source<br /><br />This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only.</p>
<p>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/WISK Battlefield Airmen Contracting Office, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, intends to award a sole source contract modification to Harris Corporation, RF Communications Division.&nbsp; This proposed action will increase the existing Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract ceiling through the remainder of the current contract period of performance (1 June 2019) to accommodate the continued procurement of AN/PRC-152A hand-held tactical radios and accessories for the Battlefield Air Operations (BAO) Program user group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The applicable NAICS code is 334220, Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing.&nbsp; The size standard as defined by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is 1,250 employees.</p>
<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 United States Code (USC) 2304 (c)(1) as implemented in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The proposed source is Harris Corporation RF Communications Division, 1680 University Ave., Rochester, NY.&nbsp; The reason for lack of competition is as follows:&nbsp; Harris Corporation is currently the only responsible source, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements for a TRL 8-9, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS)-compliant, hand-held radio that is interoperable with fielded radio systems/mission-critical waveforms currently in use in the battlefield, and within size weight and power (SWaP) parameters.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.&nbsp; This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All information submitted should support the respondent's capability to provide the items required, and shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.&nbsp; Responses must be in writing and must provide clear and concise documentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government shall consider responses that are received not later than 12:00 PM Eastern Time, Wednesday, 17 January 2018.&nbsp; All inquiries and responses may be submitted in writing (phone calls will not be accepted) to amber.taylor.9@us.af.mil.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed-price&nbsp;contract to&nbsp;the University of Hawaii&nbsp;for the analysis of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) whole body, proximal femur, anterior/posterior lumbar spine, instant vertebral assessment scans of lateral spine and anterior/posterior spine using Hologic, Inc. software and hardware for compatibility with DXA data previously collected. <br /><br />This is a request for a sole source procurement to obtain the services of the University of Hawaii&nbsp;for analysis of whole body, proximal femur, anterior/posterior lumbar spine, instant vertebral assessment DXA scans of the lateral spine and&nbsp;anterior/posterior spine using Hologic, Inc., The Hologic Discovery A fan beam X-ray bone densitometers have been used to measure bone density in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) since 1988 and total body composition since 1999. Due to compatability and consistency of&nbsp; methods, codes, and their unique QA and QC procedures over the years, the Univeristy of Hawaii&nbsp;has the only experienced principal investigator&nbsp;who meets the government's requirement for valid, reliable, reproducible, rapid, and reportable results.<br /><br />This contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested entities may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received by 10:00 AM EST on 01/29/2018&nbsp;as a result&nbsp;of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Any quotation/response should be emailed to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:hbish@cdc.gov">hbish@cdc.gov</a> &nbsp;by the response deadline.<br /><br />The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Program, administered by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), collects information on the health of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Each NHANES includes interviews in respondents' homes, and private interviews, laboratory assessments, and physical examinations in mobile examination centers (MECs). Each MEC is comprised of four interconnected trailer units. The MECs are owned by the Federal government and staffed by data collection contractor staff through a separate contractual agreement. <br /><br />NCHS conducted seven NHANES between 1960 and 1994. In 1999 NHANES became a continuous survey. Each year approximately 7,000 individuals of all ages are interviewed in their homes; of these approximately 5,000 complete the health examination component of the survey. While a nationally representative sample of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population is selected each survey year, two or more years of data are necessary to obtain adequate sample sizes for subgroup analysis.</p>
<p>The content of the health examination has varied between surveys. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was included for the first time in the NHANES during NHANES III, 1988-94. Femoral bone mineral density was assessed at that time using pencil-beam bone densitometers (Hologic QDR 1000) in the MECs. In 1999, the DXA component included whole body DXA scans using Hologic QDR 4500A fan-beam bone densitometers. Collection of whole body scans continued through 2005. In 2005, scans of the proximal femur and anterioposterior (AP) or lumbar spine were added. In 2013, instant vertebral assessment (IVA) scans of the lateral spine and AP spine were added. An average of 3,600 persons age 8 years and older complete the DXA component each year, although this number has varied. In 2017 and 2018 DXA component includes whole body, spine and femur scans. In addition to the information provided by DXA, anthropometric data are collected on all examined persons.</p>
<p>The NHANES DXA data are used to examine age, sex, and race differences in body composition (bone mineral, lean soft tissue, and fat mass) during the life cycle and to explore the relationship between body composition and behavioral factors such as diet and physical activity and physiologic factors such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Bone measurements from DXA enhance the evaluation of skeletal health in the U.S. population by providing estimates of osteoporosis and nationally representative data on BMD for ages 8 years and older. Femur BMD and questionnaire fracture history information will be used in a risk assessment model to assess absolute fracture risk. The IVA lateral and AP spine images also will provide information on vertebral fractures and abdominal aortic calcification for participants ages 40 years and older.</p>
<p>Prior to conducting the DXA examination, examinees are screened for safety and medical contraindications (e.g., pregnancy, recent medical tests with contrast material, metal sutures, implanted devices, etc.)</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in support of the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) intends to negotiate on an other than full and open basis the purchase of optical filters (dichroic mirrors and band-pass) manufactured by Chroma Technology Corp, 10 Imtec Lane, Bellows Falls, VT 05101. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR Part 13.501 (a)(1). <br /><br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type of contract. <br /><br />Delivery to Bethesda, Maryland 20814. <br /><br />Period of Performance: One Year from Award Date<br /><br />The VRC currently operates eight Flow Cytometer analyzers that have proven to be uniquely suited to the analytical requirements. The instruments provide 6 separate lasers and 30 detector capabilities, and they have been well-suited to operate by users with minimal facility supervision. These instruments require critical optical filters to measure multi-dimensional parameters in the effort to expand the detector base and to measure the entire spectral curve of all fluorochromes measured by the current configuration. Therefore, the optical filters are critical to the detection of the spectra for each fluorochrome measured in all detectors. These filters will allow the laboratory to select the best configuration for spectral analysis using the violet laser and the tetra-penta detector array. No substitutes allowed. <br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source requirement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 only one source available, no substitutions possible. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. All responsible sources who can provide the same products may submit a response that could be considered by email (subject line to reference NIAID-NOI-18-1883929) to Akilah Bullock at akilah.bullock@nih.gov, by 4:00 pm eastern standard time Wednesday, January 17, 2018. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NIAID to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. All responses received by the closing date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Dear Interested Parties,
<p><br />The United States Agency for International Development in Vietnam (USAID/Vietnam) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a five-year contract for USAID/Vietnam Trade Facilitation Program. USAID intends to use full and open competition for this procurement. The solicitation is anticipated to be released on or about January 31, 2018 and will be made available electronically upon its release to www.fbo.gov. <br /> <br />The purpose of the program will be to support Vietnam to adopt and implement a risk management approach to customs, which will facilitate the implementation of the World Trade Organization's Trade Facilitation Agreement of which both Vietnam and the United States are members. The objectives of the program will be to achieve the simplification, harmonization, professionalization, and adoption and implementation of risk management customs approaches at the national and provincial levels to expedite cross-border trade and to enable Vietnam to implement WTO TFA commitments. To implement risk management approaches, there needs to be simplified policies and procedures across GVN units, stronger linkages between national and provincial levels, and improved coordination and implementation at the provincial level. Further, to effectively implement a risk management system, GVN needs to strengthen trust and communication between the GVN and private sector.<br /><br />Prospective Offerors are advised that this procurement is subject to internal USAID approvals and the availability of funds. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and in no way obligates the US Government to issue an RFP/IFB and/or award a contract. This notice satisfies the synopsis requirement in FAR 5.2. If a solicitation is issued, all necessary information will be supplied at the time it is posted at www.fbo.gov. Questions/requests for information will not be responded to until RFP issuance. Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website and solicitation number for updates concerning this procurement. <br /><br />Sincerely,<br />/s/<br />Michael Capobianco<br />Contracting Officer</p>

Upgrade/Modification to MX series of sensor systems (MX-8, previously purchased MX-10 systems only, MX-15, MX-20 and MX-25) that meet the following objectives:<br /><br />The contractor shall modify each class of NDI MX Sensors with laser designator (MX-8D, previously purchased MX-10D systems only, MX-15D, M-20D, and MX-25D) to address obsolescence and or capability improvements. These upgrades/modifications can be made to software and hardware of existing systems; however, the Government desires they be made without significant changes to the current size, weight and power of the existing sensors. The Government is also interested in the industry's ability to provide alternative EO/IR systems and or approaches to meet the upgrade/modification objectives. These upgrade/modifications may include the following:</p>
<p>1. Advanced Video Tracker: Enhanced target auto tracker function that can acquire and lock onto multiple man and vehicle sized targets.</p>
<p>2. Embedded Moving Target Indicator (MTI): An MTI tracking mode embedded into the systems that provides acquisition of multiple man and vehicle sized targets and provides moving tracks of the target.</p>
<p>3. Low Cost Miniaturized HD Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) Imagers: Reduce Size, Weight, and Power + Cost (SWaP+C) high sensitivity uncooled SWIR imagers for systems. SWIR imagers provide day/night imaging capability, through obscurants and laser spotting capability to solider systems.</p>
<p>4. Dual-Band Infrared Focal Plane Arrays: Affordable production-ready, high yield, dual-band MW/LW III-V IRFPAs for Improved Forward Looking Infrared B-kit with improved performance</p>
<p>5. Automated Geo-registration/Metric Sensing: Design or leverage a software/firmware-based geo-registration tool capable of automatically geo-referencing aerial images in all spectral bands. The software should perform the following:</p>
<p>a. Automatic orthorectification/geo-registration of motion imagery and still images.</p>
<p>b. Pixel-level geo-registration accuracy.</p>
<p>c. Real or near real time post-processing.</p>
<p>d. Automatic geo-registration: Feature-based and direct methods.</p>
<p>6. Military Specification Global Positioning Systems (GPS): Secure anti-jamming and anti-spoofing GPS receivers as in addition to providing precision location it plays a crucial role in the success of military operations by providing precise time and frequency to communication systems.</p>
<p>7. Turbulence Mitigation: Turbulence mitigation reduces heat distortion effects (primarily seen in long-range EO video).</p>
<p>8. Picture in Picture (PIP): PIP allows user to simultaneously, within a single user interface, view multiple sensor (EO or IR) outputs.</p>
<p>All modifications require production testing performed by the contractor to verify performance.</p>
<p>G. Maintenance and support of MX-8D, MX-10D , MX-15D, MX-20D and MX-25D sensors that meet the following objectives:</p>
<p>Depot level capabilities must include depot level and lower levels of diagnosis, repair, and functional/conformance testing that can address part failures during normal utilization of the sensors as well as non-standard repairs such as damage during shipment, crashes, aircraft hard landings or battle damage. Support capabilities must be tailorable to a range of systems' Operational Availability (Ao) levels that meet the threshold of 95%. Approaches must also address the ability to support an expanding fleet of MX sensors, with multiple sensor or platform configurations, in locations around the world.</p>
<p>Depot level capabilities must include an overview of the vendor's ability to facilitate an organic depot capability through a public/private partnership (P3). This will include necessary data, training, materials, and equipment required to implement a depot-level repair program at a U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) organic depot to support a peacetime workload scenario.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only at this time and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Purpose of this Request for Information 

The Department of Veterans Affairs Network Contracting Office (NCO) 10, Service Team #4 is seeking interested sources (contractors) for a near-future solicitation and procurement to provide all parts, materials, labor, and supervision for the repair of the RYTEC Garage Bay Door 2 of the Warehouse of the Ann Arbor VA Medical Center, located at 2215 Fuller Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48105.

Project Description: 

Department of Veterans Affairs Warehouse, located at 2215 Fuller Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48105, requires the repair of one spiral door. The door was hit by a tractor and was bent. The garage remains in use, causing further damage to parts that allow the garage door to function properly. The garage door has not been able to close properly, which is particularly troublesome in negative degree weather. Additionally, safety and security issues are impacting the use of warehouse space. All bent/broken parts need to be repaired/replaced, and the door must be returned to an operational condition so that it functions as designed.  

Because this is a RFI announcement, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents.  No solicitation exists. Therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.

The duration of the construction will be limited to 120 calendar days during the projected Hoover 2019 Outage Season beginning on or about Oct 1, 2018 and end on or about Jan 31, 2019.

<DESC>The items in the attached spreadsheet are being considered for a multiyear program. Anyone wishing to participate in the program should contact the primary point of contract. PLEASE SPECIFY WHICH ITEM OR ITEMS YOUR COMPANY IS INTERESTED IN PROVIDING.<br /><br />The program is designed to sustain/improve readiness for the following vehicles 1) Abrams Main Battle Tank, 2) Stryker Family of Vehicles, 3) Light Armored Vehicle Family of Vehicles, 4) Cougar, 5) Buffalo, and 6) RG-31.<br /><br />The initiative also provides for improved Obsolescence/Configuration Change Management, helps maintain a viable supply chain, and improves DLA's visibility to the lowest levels of the supply chain through enhanced communication with the awardee for items the Government has identified as critical parts in support of the above listed vehicles. This element of the program will be supported through periodic item Obsolescence/Configuration Change Management reporting to the Government along with an accompanying meeting to discuss the report.<br /><br />Additionally, the program supports Production Lead-time Reductions through "Inventory Programs" which provide the Government the opportunity to reduce inventories while responding to customer demands in a timelier manner.

<DESC>Small Business Sources Sought (SBSS) Notice Number:  NIH-NICHD-SBSS-2018-17<br />Agency/Office:  National Institutes of Health<br />Location:  Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)<br />Key Dates:  Release Date: January 12, 2018<br />Response Date:  January 29, 2017<br />Purpose of this Announcement:  This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; (a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.  Your responses to the information requested will assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible.  An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.  This requirement is assigned a code of 541711 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the small business size standard for such requirements is 1000 employees or less. <br />Background and Project Requirements: Newborn screening programs currently screen more than 4 million U.S. infants per year. The intent of newborn screening is to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions in newborns, thereby providing a window of opportunity for early treatment, often while the child is still asymptomatic.  This public health program has saved countless lives through the identification of infants who are at risk for congenital disorders for which early interventions and treatments have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality.<br />In 2006, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) developed newborn screening guidelines that recommend that all newborn infants be screened for 29 "core conditions" and that 25 secondary conditions identified during the core evaluations are to be reported. These recommendations have been accepted by the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) (originally authorized by the Children's Health Act of 2000), and the Secretary of HHS. This panel now includes 34 core conditions and 26 secondary conditions that form the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP). Most states now use this or very similar panels for newborn screening.  There has been broad acceptance of these screening guidelines by state screening laboratories, and interest in adding new tests that have been appropriately vetted to the recommended panel. In addition, under the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2007 and reaffirmed under the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2014, the Hunter Kelly Newborn Screening Research Program within NICHD is authorized to carry out, coordinate, and expand research in newborn screening.<br />Currently, policies related to newborn screening are determined through analysis of the severity and incidence of each condition under consideration, the specificity and sensitivity of the screening test, the natural history of the disorder, and the efficacy, safety, and effectiveness of treatments available for the disorder. <br />To date, there are thousands of rare disorders that have been identified and hundreds that could potentially benefit from newborn screening.  However, research in this arena, where many of the disorders are rare diseases and states have varying rules and regulations related to newborn screening, has been challenging for investigators.  <br />To address this problem, the Newborn Screening Translational Research Network (NBSTRN) was established to provide infrastructure support and scientific guidance to researchers working to:  a) Identify, develop and test promising new screening technologies; b) Increase the specificity of newborn screening;  c) Expand the number of conditions for which screening tests are available; and/or d) Develop experimental treatments and disease management strategies for additional newborn conditions, and other genetic, metabolic, hormonal and or functional conditions that can be detected through newborn screening for which treatment is not yet available.<br />The purpose of this solicitation is to hold an open competition to maintain and enhance the infrastructure resources within the NBSTRN.<br />Objective: <br />Maintain, administer and enhance the NBSTRN and provide technical, regulatory, statistical, scientific, and administrative support to carry out the tasks specified below:<br />1)  Address the needs of biomedical investigators throughout the country to effectively share and have access to dried bloodspots and other samples including possibly enrolled patients in a site-independent manner for research. <br />2)  Facilitate evaluating the predictive value of biomarkers through early phase clinical/epidemiological studies.<br />3)  Encourage collaboration and rapid dissemination of information to ensure progress and avoid fragmentation of effort.<br />4)  Facilitate research on the development of new methods and technologies.<br />5)  Facilitate research on screened and treated patients to define effectiveness of treatments and long-term outcomes.<br />Anticipated Period of Performance:  The anticipated period of performance is five years, from September 2018 - September 2023.<br />Capability Statement/Information:  The NICHD is seeking Small Businesses capable of meeting the criteria listed below.  Small Business organizations must submit Capability Statements in response to this notice. To be deemed capable of developing and maintaining the NBSTRN, the offeror must submit a written capability statement that clearly demonstrates their experience and ability to:  <br />1.

Maintain and enhance a network of centralized and institutionally-enabled infrastructure to support the capture and managed storage of longitudinal clinical data from individuals following newborn screening.<br />4. Maintain a data repository that securely houses long term follow-up genomic data, materials metadata and key phenotypic data for subjects followed within the long-term follow-up dataset. <br />5. Establish, maintain and administer a web-based interactive resource related to the ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) relevant to Newborn Screening for investigators. <br />6. Facilitate, through collaborations with other Federal entities and interested stakeholders, the development and use of common data elements and standardized language for newborn screening disorders and disorders that may benefit in the future from newborn screening.<br />7. Support active and future newborn screening research projects, including pilot studies for conditions with the potential to be added to the RUSP.<br />8. Facilitate the timely dissemination of research findings in the form of written publications, web-based materials, and presentations at newborn screening-related in-person or virtual meetings, such as the annual ACMG meeting and the Association of Public Health Laboratories newborn screening symposium to a variety of stakeholders.<br />9.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK<br />VAQUITA PORPOISE REFERENCE GENOME SEQUENCE</p>
<p>I. Introduction<br />The vaquita porpoise (Phocoena sinus) is the most endangered marine mammal, with an estimated population of &lt;15 individuals remaining in a small region of the northern Gulf of California, Mexico. In November, 2017, an adult female was captured as part of an effort to bring vaquitas into captivity for breeding and protection. The female died in captivity, and a complete necropsy was completed with collection of multiple tissues for cell culture and genomic analysis. The current project goal is to use the high-quality DNA available from the cultured cells from this vaquita to generated the complete reference genome sequence of the vaquita. In order to meet the standards of a reference genome, multiple sequencing and DNA mapping technologies and analytical methods need to be employed, providing long and short-read DNA fragments and chromosome anchors to allow a de novo assembly, and sequencing of cDNA from expressed genes in the cultured cells to aid in gene identification and annotation. The completed reference genome will be a public resource representing the porpoise lineage of cetaceans, and allow for completion ongoing genomic research of the vaquita to understand its unique evolutionary history, issues relevant to conservation of the species, and genetic diversity important for conservation and studies of evolution and population genetics of cetaceans.</p>
<p>II. Background: <br />Previous genetic analysis of vaquita porpoises have indicated little or no genetic diversity, suggesting potential increased risk of genetic issues as the population declines. As genomic technologies have become available, we have begun genomic analysis of vaquitas, based on historical samples in the SWFSC genetics collection. Initial mitochondrial genome analysis indicates that there is more diversity than previously thought. High-coverage genome sequences have been generated for 20 vaquita samples collected between 1985 and 2017, but these sequences are limited to short fragments that need to be aligned to a reference genome for appropriate organization and analysis. No porpoise reference genome currently exists, so the goal of this project is to generate the first complete reference genome for a porpoise. Recent collection of fresh tissues from a vaquita, and successful culture of cells from the tissue, provide the first opportunity to obtain sufficient quality and quantity of DNA to generate the reference genome.</p>
<p>III. Period of Performance: <br />From receipt of cultured cells, sample preparation, sequencing, mapping, assembly and annotation of the reference genome is expected to take 3 to 6 months from date of award. The project will be considered complete when both the raw data and annotated reference genome sequences are made publicly available through public genome databases (US NCBI GenBank, European Ensembl Genome Browser).</p>
<p>IV. Technical Specifications: <br />The goal is to generate a reference genome that meets internationally agreed standards of high-quality, error-free, near gapless, chromosome-level, haplotype-phased, and annotated reference genome assembly. Cultured cells will be shipped to the genome sequencing laboratory for DNA and RNA extraction, multiple genomic library preparations (for each of the sequencing and mapping technologies), genomic sequencing and mapping, and de novo assembly of the reference genome. The required technologies include PacBio long-read and Illumina short-read sequencing, 10X Genomics, Hi-C, and BioNano scaffolding, and IsoSeq RNA sequencing for gene annotation). RNA sequencing will allow direct identification and organizational annotation of a portion of the vaquita genes, and multiple analytical pipelines will be used to further annotate all genes. Multiple bioinformatics and analytical techniques are required to complete the de novo assembly and annotation. Both the raw data and the completed reference genome will be made publicly available through arrangement with a public web-hosting organization and through public genome databases in the US and Europe.</p>
<p>V. Description of Work and Services:<br />&bull; Task 1. Extraction of DNA and RNA from cultured cells <br />&bull; Task 2. Construction of appropriate DNA libraries for sequencing <br />&bull; Task 3. Multiple sequencing and genome mapping technologies to generate data. <br />&bull; Task 4. De novo assembly and annotation of the reference genome <br />&bull; Task 5. Public web hosting of raw data and reference genome</p>
<p>VI. Deliverables:<br />A complete reference genome sequence will be made available to the project leader as soon as it is completed, to aid in ongoing assembly and analysis of multiple vaquita genomes. All raw sequence data will be made available to the public through a web-based data server, and complete annotated reference genome will be made available through the international genome databases GenBank (US NCBI) and Ensembl Genome Browser (EU).</p>
<p>VII. Required Knowledge and Experience:<br />Selected individuals must have the following qualifications:</p>
<p>&bull; Expertise in next generation sequencing techniques (specifically with the Illumina, PacBio, BioNano, 10x Genomics, Hi-C, and RNA IsoSeq platforms), and genomic library generation for the respective techniques.<br />&bull; Expertise in processing next generation sequencing data.<br />&bull; Expertise in de novo genomic assembly, mapping, and genome annotation. <br />&bull; Statistical and bioinformatics analytical expertise.<br />&bull; Access to computing facilities for the above analyses, and ability to permanently provide public access to the raw data, and make the completed reference genome available through international genome databases.</p>

<p>Summary of Scope:</p>
<p>&bull; Project Description:<br />Fort Point is a large third system Civil War fort constructed of brick and granite. It is listed as a contributing structure in the Presidio of San Francisco National Historic Landmark (NHL) District, identified as a nationally significant on the National Register of Historic Places when created in 1970. <br />It is the sole purpose for the creation of Fort Point National Historic Site. Fort Point, along with the fortification of Alcatraz Island, was constructed to protect gold shipments through the Golden Gate. It is the only Civil War Era Fort on the West Coast. As a NHL, Fort Point is to be given the highest level of protection providing under the National Historic Preservation Act and the federal regulations (36 CFR Part 800) that govern NPS procedures under the law.<br />The annual visitation to the fort is 500,000 including school children, tour groups, visitors to the Bay Area, and local residents. Activities include cannon demonstrations, a video presentation, ranger programs, and an audio tour. Fort Point is a specific destination in the Bay Area for those who are interested in the surprising Civil War history of San Francisco and California. If a major earthquake occurs in the Bay Area, Fort Point will be closed, and could be lost forever. These predictions are based on a recent structural evaluation, and on USGS statistics on the likelihood of a major earthquake (75 percent over the next 20 years). <br />Fort Point is the only fort of its type on the West Coast. It is the preeminent place to tell the story of the struggle for California Confederacy. For most of the school children as well as other visitors to the fort, this may be their only direct contact with Civil War history. The project directly supports Fort Point's enabling legislation, and also the National Historic Preservation Act, which requires the NPS to provide special protection of National Historic Landmark contributing structure.</p>
<p>Currently the rain water is infiltrating the casemates of the Fort from the barbette tier and is causing damage to the brick, mortar, as well as to the casemate finishes. Without stopping the infiltration of the water from the barbette tier (roof of the third tier casemates), re-pointing the mortar will not last and the brick will come loose. The fort is a masonry load bearing structure that depends on the masonry being in good condition for its structural strength. The mortar is in serious need of repair and replacement. The maritime weather conditions and the alga growth on the exterior walls are causing the deterioration of the brick and mortar. The repairs described above are needed to help preserve and maintain this National Register Property which is a contributing structure to both the Presidio of San Francisco National Historic Landmark District and a potential Seacoast Fortification National Historic Landmark District. Fort Point National Historic Site was created in 1970 by an Act of Congress to "preserve and interpret for future generations the historical significance of Fort Point." The work is also necessary to maintain the masonry vaults and facings in good condition to protect the public and employees from falling hazards of loose brick and mortar. Additionally, the fort is in a high seismic hazard zone and has survived three major earthquakes, although with damage requiring repair. Masonry structures are extremely vulnerable to seismic events especially if their masonry is not in good condition. The risk to the public and staff is from falling hazards due to falling masonry and/or structural collapse. The public will be much better protected if the masonry is maintained in good condition..</p>
<p>Contractors should address the following Criteria in their capability statements:<br />1) Experience performing the following work:<br />a. Masonry and masonry re-pointing<br />b. Horizontal and structural concrete work<br />c. Site Civil (including excavation and hauling of overburden)<br />d. Brick Masonry<br />e. Working within harsh wind/rain conditions<br />f. Masonry washing and cleaning in an environmentally sensitive area<br />2) Relevance of Project Experience to this Project:<br />a. Historic and Natural resource protection<br />b. Work for National Park Service or projects with similar requirements<br />c. Culturally-Sensitive projects<br />d. Work or rehabilitation on large brick masonry projects.<br />e. Work with large scaffolding structures</p>

<CONTACT>Michelle L. Johnson, Phone 2154306717, Email Michelle.L.Johnson@hud.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. IT IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY SERVICES, AND HUD DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED.
<p><br />The purpose of this notice is to conduct a market survey to determine if there are adequate Small Businesses, HUBZone, 8(a), Women Owned, Economically Disadvantaged Women Owned, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business contractors that can provide Personal Assistance Services (PAS) for Qualified Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) employees with targeted disabilities at HUD Headquarters; as well as, all program offices and telework locations nationwide.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 624120 - Services for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities. The business size standard for NAICS Code 624120 is $11M.</p>
<p>On January 3, 2017, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC or Commission) issued a final rule amending 29 CFR 1614.203 to clarify the affirmative action obligations Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 imposes on federal agencies as employers. In relevant part, the final rule requires federal agencies to provide personal assistance services (PAS) to employees who, because of targeted disabilities, require such assistance in order to be at work, to telework, or to participate in work-related travel.</p>
<p>Please visit the following site for detailed information regarding Federal Agencies' Obligation to Provide Personal Assistance Services (PAS) under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act:</p>
<p>https://www.eeoc.gov/federal/directives/personal-assistance-services.cfm</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK:</p>
<p>Personal Assistance Service (PAS) provider means an employee or independent contractor whose primary job functions include provision of personal assistance services. PAS are not the same as services that help the individual perform job-related tasks, such as sign language interpreters for individuals who are deaf or readers for individuals who are blind or have learning disabilities. These services are already required as reasonable accommodations under the Rehabilitation Act that prohibits discrimination based on disability, so long as the provision of such services does not impose an undue hardship. Although a PAS provider may provide sign language interpreter and/or reader services, the PAS provider must provide personal assistance services.</p>
<p>PAS differs from medical services and services that are typically performed by someone who often has the job title of "personal assistant." Personal assistance services are non-medical services such as helping an individual take off and put on a coat, eat, and use the restroom. These services are needed by individuals whose specific disabilities make it difficult for them to perform such activities on their own. Skilled medical care, which involves personal use items/services is not required to be furnished by an employer in the workplace.</p>
<p>The Contractor will provide and manage a pool of qualified personnel to assist HUD employees department-wide/nation-wide, including Hawaii and Puerto Rico. with targeted disabilities who need Personal Assistance Services (PAS) to perform the following personal care, office, and other work-related functions typically expected of employees without disabilities. The PAS provider shall assist with but not limited to the following needs while at work, in a duty status, and or while on official Government travel:</p>
<p>A. General Office Tasks: Assistance with general office tasks , including, but not limited to: copying and collating; retrieving dropped items/work materials that are out of reach; checking available conference rooms to assess whether there is adequate space to reasonably and comfortably accommodate the employee when attending meetings (and rearranging the conference room if needed); assembling and preparing documents and reports; filing and organizing; printing; typing; answering the telephone; retrieving dropped items, and carrying items to and from meetings; taking notes; filling out forms, shredding, faxing, and scanning documents; and, lifting and moving work materials/documents;</p>
<p>B. Transportation/Travel Management: Assistance with transportation/travel management (excluding driving) that could include en-route travel, destination only travel, and/or overnight travel; showering and dressing employees while on travel; transferring employees from a wheelchair/scooter to a vehicle; and retrieving personal items of the employee from luggage/purse/wallet; government travel regulations will apply.</p>
<p>C. Evacuation: Assistance with building evacuation during evacuation/shelter-in-place drills and emergencies (per the evacuation process outlined by the respective HUD agency/building);</p>
<p>D. Personal Care: Assistance with personal-care related needs while on the job or on work-related travel (e.g., removing and putting on clothing (e.g., coats, hats, snow boots, scarves), feeding, and helping the employee in accessing the restroom/using the lavatory);</p>
<p>E. Assistive Technology: Assistance in the use of computer technology, when appropriate; and <br />Under no circumstances is the PAS provider to perform any of the employee's essential or non-essential job duties. The PAS provider is only permitted to provide access to otherwise inaccessible aspects of the job or personal care.</p>
<p>Since each employee who uses Personal Assistance Services (PAS) has a different need, the unique combination of PAS provided to each employee will be determined after their individual limitations and accommodation needs are assessed. Specific employee needs will be provided to the contractor so that the PAS provider is capable and qualified to meet the employee's specific PAS needs.<br /><br />RESPONSE REQUIREMENT:</p>
<p>Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested Small Business, HUBZone, <br />8(a), Women-Owned Small Businesses, Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned, or Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business contractors should submit a narrative demonstrating their experience in similar scope, complexity and value (for reference purposes, use $150,000.00/year) within the last three (3) years. Moreover, demonstrate their ability to successfully complete these services nationwide. If nationwide is not possible, provide a description of available regions. Capability statements should include size/classification of your firm, details of similar projects (scope, complexity and value), completion dates, references and contract amount. Narratives shall be no longer than FIVE (5) pages. Responses should be sent to Michelle L. Johnson at <br />Michelle.L.Johnson@hud.gov to reach this office on or before January 18, 2018.</p>
<p>This is for market research purposes only and IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). It does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP).   <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.
<p>The Open Period for February* is February 1, 2018 to February 7, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to keep current offers, modify or withdraw those offers.  <br /> <br />This RLP is effective immediately and will apply to all requirements competed through the AAAP program through the remainder of FY 2018 or until it is replaced.</p>
<p>DELINEATED AREA: All properties offered to the Government pursuant to the RLP Number 18-REG01 and must be located within Region 1 (New England).</p>
<p>To view the states and territories within the region, refer to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/22227.</p>
<p>Delineated areas are clarified further in the RLP posted on the AAAP website and may be restricted further when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:  Up to 15 years. Lease term may be further defined when specific space requirements are developed and a project specific advertisement is posted.</p>
<p><br />* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.<br /></p>

BACKGROUND:
VA has an imminent requirement with potential impact to VA and its mission. VA requires experience in program management, project management, and business process reengineering specific to the HSPD-12/PIV environment.  Given this enterprise-wide transformational change, business process and technical complexities, this initiative will require highly skilled resources with extensive demonstrated knowledge and expertise with HSPD-12/Personal Identity Verification (PIV).  
The NextGen PIV solution will need to align with current VA PIV, to include governance, architecture, procedures, as well as the current VA PIV operational entities across the VA enterprise.
The vendor must have demonstrated knowledge of VA current s PIV operations, current as-is state, the VA PIV future-state, and VA enterprise structure.  Specific tasks include:  Strategic Planning, Program Startup, and Assisting with program planning.  In September 2016, senior VA officials determined that VA will begin to transition to a Next Generation (NextGen) PIV solution, which will be a Federal shared services through the General Services Administration (GSA) USAccess Management Service Agreement.
Due to a PKI certificate expiration issue, approximately 500,000 VA PIV cards issued by the current Card Management System (CMS) expire on or before August 6, 2018.  This is an enterprise-wide crisis and VA must expedite the reissuance of PIV cards.  In order to meet the 2018 reissuance goal, VA requires a contractor staff that can provide expertise in VA policies, advisories, directives and guidance for both the current CMS as well as USAccess.
The contractor shall provide Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) who have demonstrated project management as well as technical HSPD-12 experience with VA s current CMS.  This demonstrated experience will support activities associated with the enterprise-wide deployment of VA s NextGen PIV.
SPECIFIC CRITERIA INCLUDES:
Demonstrated experience and knowledge of VA s current PIV governance, the VA PIV as-is state, the VA PIV future state, VA PIV enterprise wide deployment and applications.

Demonstrated experience with VA NextGen PIV solution development, planning, and implementation to rollout a hybrid approach of VA CMS and USAccess.

Demonstrated experience with GSA USAccess as VA s NextGen PIV solution.

Demonstrated experience conducting workforce and PIV card analysis using VA s CMS to include a correlation between VA s human resources databases and VA s Active Directory data.

Demonstrated understanding of the over 200 VA PIV Issuance Facilities (PCIF) to plan for deployment of a NextGen solution to include detailed challenges/risks and complete contingency plans. 

Developing a governance structure and establish an Executive Steering Committee, an Integrated Project Team (IPT) structure, and associated Tiger Teams for the VA NextGen PIV solution.  

Providing administrative support for the IPT and Tiger Teams, including but not limited to developing and distributing meeting agendas, coordinating working group calendars and meeting invitations, coordinating contributions and feedback of work products, and facilitating collaboration and exchanging of ideas and meetings.
It is requested that the contractors respond to the following questions:
Provide a Technical Capabilities Statement not to exceed 20 pages detailing relevant experience/expertise and capability relevant to ALL above stated criteria (1-7).
Detail your company s ability to meet the PIV issuance requirement within 45 days from contract award.
Small businesses should also include information as to:
the intent and ability to meet set-aside requirements for performance of this effort, if applicable
information as to available personnel and financial resources
Information as to proposed team members, the percentage of work each is to perform and which PWS requirements are planned to be subcontracted
SDVOSBs must indicate whether at least 50% of the cost of effort is planned to be expended for prime employees or employees of other eligible SDVOSB firms. This should also include the prime planned percentage and if under 50%, the names of the potential team members that may be used to fulfill the 50% SDVOSB requirement.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION<br /><br />The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager Close Combat Systems (PM CCS), is issuing this sources sought notice as a means of conducting market research to identify potential sources that have an interest and industry technologies available to share their knowledge of an emerging munitions requirement for a Close-Range Terrain Shaping Obstacle (CTSO). The CTSO seeks to deny the enemy terrain and freedom of action while allowing friendly forces to maneuver freely within the same battlespace. The Area Denial capability will be required to provide Man-in-the-Loop (MITL) controlled scalable effects against mounted and dismounted enemy forces that disrupt, turn, fix, or block their ability to maneuver. Some areas of interest are munitions, munitions emplacement, sensors, data management, command &amp; control, and communications. Munition capabilities include networked munitions, low collateral self-destruct, and breaching deterrents, identification and classification of targets.

<DESC><p><br /><br />S/SVT INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Combined Arms Center for Training (CAC-T), Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, will conduct an Industry Day on 22-23 January 2018 at the Frontier Conference Center on Ft Leavenworth, Kansas. The objective of this event is to communicate the S/SVT concept to Industry partners and Academia, and to address any questions or concerns interested parties may have regarding the effort.</p>
<p>Solider/Squad Virtual Trainer (S/SVT)&nbsp;reflects a combination of the Squad Immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT)&nbsp;and the Solider Virtual Trainer (SVT) efforts.&nbsp; If you have previously registered for the SiVT Industry Day, your registration is still valid and you do not need to register again. <br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND/PURPOSE:</span></p>
<p><br />The Army lacks an integrated Soldier and Squad simulation training capability for close combat, multi-domain battle in diverse complex operational environments. Moreover, there are virtual training shortfalls for qualification and certification of precision targeting with precision munitions, replication and integration of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and counter UAS operations, as well as the conduct and clearance of fires and airspace de-confliction. The Army seeks to develop the next generation virtual training capability through the S/SVT effort to fill those gaps and advance weapons skill development, call for fire, and use of force training.</p>
<p>To address the gaps identified above, the Army/USMC requires a scalable, transportable, Soldier/squad close combat simulation trainer that provides:</p>
<p>- Realistic and tailorable OE and Acceptable equipment form, fit, and function that allows squad dismounted operations<br />- Provides training at the Point of Need<br />- Scalable from the individual to squad <br />- Software engine agnostic <br />- Intelligent tutor that captures and builds upon each repetition to accelerate skill acquisition<br />- Provides user feedback/AAR capability<br />- Soldier enabled capability that reduces overall setup time for increased training throughput</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDUSTRY DAY DETAILS:</span></p>
<p>Industry Day participation is available on a first come, first serve basis. Pre-registration is required (see information below on registration process, "How To Register").

<DESC><strong>Synopsis:</strong> <br /><br />NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. <strong>NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses.</strong><br /><br /><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: <br /></strong><br />Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a thrust actuating device for a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft. The technology is unique because no mechanically driven actuation is required to transition from hover flight to wing born flight. The result is lower aircraft empty weight and robust aircraft that has a benign response to wind gusts and shear. In addition, the aircraft fuselage can be designed for exceptional pilot visibility. This novel thrust actuating device includes several innovations in the aerodynamically stable tilt actuation of propellers, propeller pylons, jets, wings, and fuselages, collectively called propulsors. The propulsors rotate between hover and forward flight mode for a tilt-wing or tilt-rotor aircraft. A vehicle designed using this technology can transition from a hovering flight condition to a wing born flight condition with no mechanical actuation and can do so without complex control systems. This results in a reduction in system weight and complexity and produces a robust and naturally stable hovering aircraft with efficient forward flight modes. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent pending.<br /><br />To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to LARC-DL-technologygateway@mail.nasa.gov with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information. Please also provide how you foresee using the technology along with a brief background of your company. Additionally, please identify any non-US interests/subsidiaries in your company as well.

When ice forms on aircraft surfaces, it affects performance by increasing weight, creating drag, and reducing lift. The coating, which is applied to the surfaces of the plane, minimizes the need to apply deicing agents and is always responsive to an ice event. This coating works by mimicking the anti-freeze proteins (AFPs) found in certain fish and amphibians. The general characteristics of AFPs include reduction in freezing point, ice recrystallization inhibition, and ice structuring (change in ice crystal morphology). The result is ice growth inhibition and ice formation prevention via an adsorption mechanism. The chemistry is based on results showing that terminal group chemical composition and chain length of polymeric coatings effected ice adhesion shear strength more than chain flexibility. These coatings are applicable to commercial aircraft, general aviation aircraft, wind turbines, or any deicing of metal surfaces to prevent corrosion, i.e. roofs, automobiles and similar structures.

<p><strong>THE TECHNOLOGY: </strong></p>
<p>Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed an inexpensive, long endurance vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that is a modification of a conventional single-prop aircraft design. The addition of vertically oriented, stow-able tail rotors and an articulating forward rotor, capable of pivoting from a horizontal to vertical orientation, enables VTOL capabilities. It is capable of flying for 24 hours, landing in a 50 x 50 zone, and can be loaded into the back of a cargo van for easy transport. In addition, it can land in an either horizontal or vertical flight configuration. The design avoids the compromises in performance that are typically made in development of dedicated VTOL or conventional aircraft by combining the speed and fuel efficiency of fixed wing aircraft with the hover-ability and flexibility of rotary aircraft. The vehicle can be used in any application where UAVs are needed to take off from, or land in, an unprepared landing area. It can take off and land vertically, as a helicopter would, without any support equipment such as a catapult launch or capture nets. It's high aspect ratio wings result in 24-hour endurance, which is unmatched in the industry. Military applications include intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. This design is also well suited for commercial applications where extended mission UAV capabilities are beneficial, such as law enforcement, firefighting, crop surveys, pipeline surveys, or oil field management. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially in the United States. US Patent pending.</p>

<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Gentec-EO USA, Inc. for the purchase of Ultraviolet Calibration Standards to be applied by the U.S. Military (Army and Navy), for the Physical Measurements Laboratory (PML).    The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>The UV Calibration Standards required were developed at NIST to operate and calibrate the Variable Output LED-365 Irradiance Source being developed in collaboration with the Army.  NIST has previously purchased several similar detector standards from Gentec-EO USA. The devices currently required are modified and improved versions of the previously purchased versions, that have been modified for NIST requirements.  They will be used at the U.S. Army along with the previously purchased devices.</p>
<p>Therefore, the unique compatibility with the previously purchased devices is a must to satisfy the current construction, calibration, and application requirements.  The devices that are currently necessary for procurement shall be used as NIST traceable standards to perform broadband linear irradiance measurements of the tunable output LED-365 UV source developed at NIST. The calibration methods and steps must be identical as those used on the existing devices fabricated by Gentec-EO USA.</p>
<p>These devices are necessary to perform irradiance measurements and calibrations in a wide range, produce equal irradiance increments and to transfer the NIST traceable integrated irradiance to test UV sources and meters in field applications.</p>
<p>Since these UV irradiance standards were fabricated by Gentec-EO USA, calibrated by NIST, and applied by the U.S. Military (Air Force and Nav), consistent fabrication is necessary for consistent measurement results.   Therefore, only Gentec-EO USA is uniquely qualified to fabricate their current versions of the devices for use at the US Army for the same applications.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and shall be in accordance with the Contractors established contract lead times.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334515, and the size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by established due date/time set forth in this notice. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to joni.laster@nist.gov . No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA, OIEP or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the appropriate personnel at Riverside Indian School in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

All questions shall be submitted via email to Margie M. Robinson at margie.robinson@bia.gov. NO PHONES CALLS PLEASE. Please reference solicitation number 140A0318Q0005 in the subject line of the email. 

The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Southern Plain Regional Office intends to award a firm-fixed price contract in response to this Request for Quote (RFQ).

PROVISION FAR 52.212-1 -- INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS, applies to this acquisition.  
FAR 52.212-2 - EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS 

(a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award will be made using a Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) approach; the Government will award to the lowest priced offeror that is determined technically acceptable.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Factor 1: Personnel Qualifications 

Factor 2: Past Experience

Factor 3:  Past Performance

All evaluation factors, when combined, are equal to cost or price.  

(b)	Factor 1: Personnel Qualifications

1.	The offeror shall submit qualifications to perform Occupational Therapy services.  Submit resume including any degrees or certifications that support qualifications to perform services.  The factor will be rated as "Technically Acceptable" or "Technically Unacceptable."
2.	"Technically Acceptable" is defined as the item offered to the Government that meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation. 
3.	"Technically Unacceptable" is defined as the item offered to the Government that does not meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.

(c)	Factor 2: Past Experience

1.	Occupational Therapy services for Special Education Programs at least two (2) years within the five (5) year period immediately preceding the release of the RFQ.   

(d)	Factor 3:  Past Performance

1.	The offeror's quote will be evaluated to determine the extent to which its past performance demonstrates the likelihood of successful performance in providing requirements similar in size, scope and complexity to the requirements identified in the RFP. The evaluation will consider both the relevance and quality of past projects.  The Government may choose to evaluate publicly available reports, and/or data from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS).   The Government may use present and/or past performance data obtained from a variety of sources. The information gathered for past performance may also be used in the responsibility determination. An Offeror without relevant past performance will receive a neutral rating (i.e., neither acceptable nor unacceptable).   

The evaluation of Past Performance will reflect the consideration of all relevant agency/customer information that is available to the Government, including both the information received from the offerors references and information obtained from other sources.

(e)	AWARD PROCESS: 

1.	The Government will first evaluate all quotations to ensure the quotation complies with all material aspects of the request for quotation thereby being determined as either "Responsive" or "Non-Responsive." 

2.	 Responsive quotes will then be submitted for Technical Evaluation to determine those that are either "Technically Acceptable" or "Technically Unacceptable."

3.	"Technically Acceptable" quotations will be then ranked according to Price.

4.	The lowest priced offeror who is technically acceptable will receive the award.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.</p>
<p>(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any <br />Government authorized end user to such clause.</p>
<p>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.</p>
<p>(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>

<DESC>The HIV/AIDS Team Leader is responsible for managing a large and diverse HIV portfolio covering prevention, care, and treatment, including orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) interventions. The HIV/AIDS Team Leader also oversees all HPN tuberculosis (TB) programming. These activities are carried out by over 40 local and international implementing partners operating through both acquisition and assistance mechanisms nationwide valued at over $317 million annually, including over $100 million annually for the procurement of anti-retroviral drugs and other commodities.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The HIV/AIDS Team Leader provides technical leadership and assistance in all areas under the HIV/AIDS portfolio. Additionally, the incumbent serves as a linkage to and advocate for integrated development programs supporting the HPN Office's other technical teams as well as the Mission at large. The incumbent has a direct leadership role in the development of the annual PEPFAR Country Operational Plan, including serving as a high level reviewer of Kenya's plan and monitoring its implementation over the course of the fiscal year. The HIV/AIDS Team Leader also plays a key role in monitoring the financial management (mortgage and pipeline) of the USAID PEPFAR portfolio, ensuring timely obligations, accruals, and financial compliance. S/he acts as a senior representative of USAID in formal and informal settings related to the position, and as a member of the diplomatic community.</p>
<p>The incumbent assists with strategic planning and design of development activities, intermediate results, and measures of achievement, as well as conceptualizing the design, documentation, and management of the HIV/AIDS and Health sector activities in Kenya. S/he supports the HIV/AIDS sector by researching, reviewing, and analyzing data to provide technical assistance and advice on sector issues to both internal and external audiences, including senior level GOK officials. The incumbent provides day-to-day oversight and management of 21 professional and administrative staff responsible for program implementation, compliance, and reporting.</p>
<p>The HIV/AIDS Team Leader is one of four senior technical advisors, and one of 56 HPN team members. S/he will report to the HPN Chief, who provides overall operational oversight and supervision. Given the integrated nature of HPN, there is heavy emphasis on interagency collaboration, and strong linkages with the GOK, civil society, and the private sector. It will be essential for the incumbent to demonstrate strong technical and managerial skills, complemented by outstanding communication and interpersonal skills. Donor collaboration is, equally, a critical and vital function under this position.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 12.6,  Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items,  as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a separate written solicitation document will not be issued.

This solicitation is a request for quotations (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular [FAC 2005-95, effective 19 Jan 2017].

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541611, with a small business size standard of $15 million.

The Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) is seeking the services of a qualified vendor in order to assist the VA in the preparation of the Major Construction Financial Review. Please see the Performance Work Statement and submission instructions below for details.

All interested companies shall provide a quotation for the following:

Services
PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT    See ATTACHMENT 1   PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

Evaluation of Offers 

Award shall be made to the offeror whose quote offers the best value to the government, considering technical capability, past performance, and price. The government will evaluate information based on the procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.106-2   Evaluation of Quotations of Offers using the following evaluation criteria: 

1) Technical Evaluation   The evaluation process will consider whether the proposal demonstrates a clear understanding of the technical features involved in meeting the requirements of the solicitation.  

2) Price    The contractor s quote shall include their proposed labor categories, rates and number of hours by task, together with associated delivery dates and sub milestone dates (if any). The Government will evaluate offers by adding all line item prices - the Total of All CLINS will be that sum. 

3) Past Performance   The Vendor s quote must include a summary description of at least three but no more than five prior contracts/orders per team member/sub-contractor for projects completed within the last five years with organizations with similar mission and functional domains, and of comparable size, complexity and scope.  These references must also include:
Contract/Order Number, brief description of the project, type of contract, amount of the contract
Contracting Officer s Name and Phone Number, Government agency
Contracting Officer s Representative Name and Phone Number

The contractor must indicate whether they were the prime contractor, sub-contractor or other teaming arrangement. Prime shall indicate which aspect they are directly responsible for of this requirement. 

The Offeror is required to provide references for the above projects.  In the event the company itself does not have relevant past performance, references may be submitted on contracts performed by the Key Personnel of the company.  The VA reserves the right to contact all the references that the Offeror lists.  
 
Evaluation Approach

A. All quotes shall be subject to evaluation by Government personnel. The Government intends to award without discussions based upon the initial evaluation of quotes. However, it may be determined necessary to conduct discussions if award cannot be made on the initial quotes submitted. 

B. All Offerors are advised that, in the interest of efficiency, the Government reserves the right to conduct the evaluation in the most effective manner. The Government reserves the right to evaluate all Offerors  technical quotes should it desire to conduct discussions, or otherwise determine it to be in the Government s best interest. 

C. The quote will be evaluated strictly in accordance with its written content. Quotes which merely restate the requirement or state that the requirement will be met, without providing supporting rationale, are not sufficient. Offerors who fail to meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation will be rated Unacceptable and thus, ineligible for award.

D. Unbalanced Pricing - The Government may evaluate whether the Offeror has submitted unbalanced pricing. An unbalanced price is one where the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated and which will result in the Government paying an unreasonably high price for contract performance or otherwise present an unacceptable level of risk to the Government. If the Contracting Officer determines that the risk is unacceptable, then the bid or offer can be rejected.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. There are several benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see Section VI of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Sr. Transition Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations in the field to provide support and guidance for program implementation, staff training and mentoring, assessments, and the development and application of lessons learned. The Sr. Transition Specialist is supervised by an OTI Division Chief (Program Learning, and Innovation Division or Field Programs Division) or his/her designee.  <br />The incumbent for this position will be expected to initially work with the Program, Learning, and Innovation Division (PLI), which develops, oversees, and manages critical processes supporting the implementation of OTI country programs.  In carrying out these responsibilities, the PLI Division engages with local partners (both government and non-governmental) in the country of operation, counterparts in the U.S. Embassy, the USAID Missions, USAID and Department of State Regional Bureaus, the National Security Council, the Congress, and foreign and international donor organizations.  The Sr. Transition Specialist will initially provide regular guidance and leadership for the OTI Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) team in Washington headquarters, including the management and supervision of ABC staff focusing on learning, training, innovation, monitoring and evaluation, and development of technology tools in support of OTI country programs.  The PLI/ABC team supports OTI's mission by facilitating learning within country programs and across the office, providing leadership on the program strategic planning processes that form OTI's business model, identifying best practices and promoting innovation.<br />In order to help ensure successful political transitions overseas in rapidly changing environments, the Sr. Transition Specialist will ensure that OTI staff, implementing partner staff, and other key players have the information and training they need to start up new programs, seek out and work with appropriate beneficiaries in the field, and manage and close out activities effectively and efficiently.  The vast majority of the workload for this position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation.</p>
<p>CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Senior Transition Specialist requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.

The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team.

<p>&bull;	Represent and articulate OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials;</p>

<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p>DUE TO LOCAL CONNECTIVITY ISSUE ON THE LAN-- THE FOLLOWING IS ADDED AND THE AMENDMENT WILL BEUPLOAD AS AMENDMENT 0002 AS SOON AS POSSIBLE-</p>
<p>&nbsp;A. This amendment to the Solicitation is to correct an error in CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT<br />B. This amendment re-incorporates FAR Clause 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014) and FAR Clause 52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998).<br />C. No other changes have been made at this time.<br />Summary of Changes in amendment states:<br />The following have been added by full text: <br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) <br />i. Ability to meet technical capability <br />a. List of hotel amenities with characteristics <br />b. Transportation Plans &ndash; Including Type of Vehicles to be used <br />C. Number of Rooms <br />ii. Price <br />iii. Past Performance <br />a. SAMs <br />As an LPTA evaluation, technical will be evaluated first as acceptable or not acceptable based on the ability to meet/exceed the salient characteristics of the required items before looking at past performance and price. Technical and past performance, when combined, have to be acceptable prior to evaluation of cost or price. If technical and past performance are acceptable, price will be the determining factor. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. (End of provision)</p>
<p>52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)<br />This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.</p>
<p>(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any <br />Government authorized end user to such clause.</p>
<p>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.</p>
<p>(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.</p>

<p>C-1 DESCRIPTION OF WORK</p>
<p>C.01 SCOPE OF WORK<br />1.1 Scope of Contract<br />It is the intent of this Task Order to secure services for planting Government- furnished seedlings in a manner to insure acceptable survival at the specified stocking level per acre. No materials, labor, supervision, or equipment will be furnished by the Government unless specifically identified as Government furnished Property. All work on this project must be complete by March 31, 2018.</p>
<p>1.2 Description and location</p>
<p>The following information is included as an attachment:</p>
<p>&bull; General vicinity map (6 map total)&#61664; Pages 9-14<br />&bull; Area table showing unit numbers, compartment, stand, acres, lat/long coordinates&#61664;Page 8</p>
<p>Location. Oconee Ranger District; Hitchiti Experimental Forest; Compartments 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9; Jones County; Compartment 106, 150, 152 in Jasper County</p>
<p>COR Contact. Kelvin Jackson, 706-584-7110 ext 118<br />Project Manager: Hector Socias, 706-485-7110 ext 107</p>
<p>Acreage. Acreage listed in the table was determined by Global Position System (GPS) and is <br />considered actual acreage and not an estimate.</p>
<p>Boundaries. Where a district stand change doesn't exist along boundary, boundaries will be marked with orange paint or flagging on perimeter trees and brush facing into the work areas.</p>
<p><br />1.3 Order of Work</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to determine the sequence of the areas worked. The Estimated date for starting work will be on or after February 15, 2018. The contract duration will be for 45 days and should be completed by March 31, 2018.</p>
<p><br />1.4 Contractor Furnished Property</p>
<p><br />The Government shall deliver the following materials, supplies, and property at the place and time specified below.</p>
<p>1. Seedlings. Containerized Longleaf pine seedlings will be furnished in sealed bags, bales, or bundles. Contractor shall be responsible for loading and transporting seedlings from the storage site to the planting site. Seedlings will be considered delivered to the Contractor when the Contractor loads seedlings on his vehicle for transporting to planting sites.</p>
<p>Seedlings may only be picked up during the specified hours and days. Not more than one day's supply of seedlings may be picked up on any one day, except a two day supply may be picked up on Friday or the day preceding a Federal holiday.</p>
<p><br />Storage Site: Pickup Time:</p>
<p>Oconee District Work Center 7:30 A.M. to 8:30 A.M.<br />Monday through Friday<br />excluding Federal holiday.</p>
<p>No more than one-day supply of seedlings can be picked up on any one day, except a two-day supply may be picked up on a Friday or the day preceding a Federal Holiday.<br />The contractor will plant all trees picked up from refrigerated storage within twenty-four hours of accepting seedlings, unless otherwise agreed to by the Forest service. When the Forest Service determines that conditions are unsuitable for planting, the Contractor will return unplanted trees to the refrigerated storage unit for delay.<br />Seedlings are perishable and have limited viability during storage. Survival of seedlings is greatly reduced when stored for too long. Seedlings stored beyond 21 days are considered unacceptable planting stock. The Contractor will be responsible for coordinating and estimating seedling needs based on crew size and order seedlings accordingly. The Contractor will be responsible for the cost of replacing expired seedlings (stored for more than 21 days) when seedlings have been ordered and stored based on contractor's schedule but were not planted prior to their storage expiration date, when within the Contractor's control. Seedling cost is shown in section 332.<br />2. Crew Organization. The contractor shall provide a competent foreman for each crew. A crew should not exceed 7 people. The foreman shall be with the crew at all times while they are working. Each crew will perform work as an individual working unit and during normal work operations will not be separated into smaller working groups, unless agreed to by Forest Service. If Contractor continues to employ a planter who continually mishandles or improperly plants seedlings, a Suspend Work Order may be issued for the entire crew.<br />C.02 TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS</p>
<p>2.1 Planting Conditions<br />Seedlings may be planted any time weather conditions are satisfactory based on the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Ground not frozen<br />&bull; Air temperature between 32 degrees and 75 degrees F.<br />&bull; Winds less than 15 MPH disregarding occasional gusts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />2.2- Spacing</p>
<p>Plant containerized seedlings at the spacing designated for the area (shown on attached table) to achieve the prescribed stocking level. Plant trees evenly over the entire area in identifiable rows. Vary spacing when necessary due to ground conditions provided however tree seedlings must be planted within a tolerance not to exceed 10 percent plus or minus the prescribed trees per acre. Minimum and maximum trees planted per acre are based on properly planted seedlings. When planting longleaf, try and space the new trees between the already existing longleaf. You can ignore the loblolly pine, as these will likely die in subsequent burning.</p>
<p>Stocking Level - tree per acre<br />Designated Minimum-- Maximum<br />Spacing (see Prescribed 10% below 10% above<br />Area Table) (Rx) Rx level Rx level</p>
<p>8 x 8 689 620 758<br /><br />NOTE: All seedlings will be planted on 8 X 8 ft spacing. Sites are previous pine beetle outbreaks areas that have been salvaged. There are some areas inhabited by existing planted longleaf and loblolly pine vegetation. Contractors are to plant within these areas and between existing pine vegetation. Any additional Site-specific information may be obtained from the Contracting Officer Representative contact in Section 1.2.</p>
<p>2.3 - Un-plantable Seedlings</p>
<p>Seedlings furnished will be "bed-run" and will contain an unknown amount of Un-plantable seedlings. Un-plantable seedlings include seedlings without lateral roots, roots less than 6 inches, stem diameter less than 1/8 inch, stems less than 6 inches, and broken stems.</p>
<p>Un-plantable seedlings are NOT to be planted. Any un-plantable seedling used will be counted as improperly planted.</p>
<p>Do not sort or cull seedlings prior to actual planting time. Cull un-plantable seedlings only when the individual seedling is removed from the planter's bag for planting. At that time, drop the un-plantable seedling on the ground. Unusual amounts of plantable seedlings that are discarded will be counted as wasted seedlings. A payment deduction will be made in accordance with Section 332.</p>
<p>2.4 - Pruning</p>
<p>Seedling roots shall NOT be pruned or cut by the contractor.</p>
<p>2.5 - Planting Instructions</p>
<p>2.51 General Instructions</p>
<p>One seedling will be planted per trash-free hole.</p>
<p>A trash-free hole for planting may be created only after the area has been cleared of surface debris to the extent that when the planting hole is created no debris can fall into the hole preventing an air tight seal. Trash such as leaves, litter, duff, etc. will be removed in the area surrounding the planting hole.</p>
<p><br />The Contractor shall supply the planting tools appropriate to the plug length being planted.</p>
<p>Seedlings shall not be planted if ground is frozen or if air temperature is below 32 degree F, or if the air temperature is above 75 degree F, unless otherwise agreed to by the Forest Service.</p>
<p>Soil moisture must be present to a depth of six inches.<br />Plant seedlings in a manner to prevent twisting of roots, "L" roots, "J" roots, or balled roots. <br />Seedlings should be firmly packed around the roots to eliminate air pockets and ensure the entire root system is in contact with the soil without damaging the seedling.<br />All planting spots in and adjacent to surface obstructions such as windrows, tree tops, ad or rocks will be planted. All along log landings and skid trails shall be planted unless directed by Forest Service not to.</p>
<p>Seedlings shall not be planted within the clearing limits of any designated system road or powerline right-of-way or within fifteen feet of a fence, existing tree line, or designated property boundaries.</p>
<p>Do not plant seedlings in standing water.</p>
<p>Seedlings shall not be planted within 12 inches of large mounds of dirt, or stump holes large enough to hamper root growth of seedling.</p>
<p>Seedlings will not be culled in the field without agreement by the Forest Service. The following criteria shall be used to determine if a seedling is un-plantable:</p>
<p>Minimum Quality Measure<br />Needles: 6-10 inches if clipped; 8-12 inches unclipped;<br />Dark green in color</p>
<p>Roots: Root collar diameter at least &frac14; inch; root light brown with numerous white tips; lateral roots abundant</p>
<p>Plug Firmness: Stay intact when extracted and when handled; remain firm when held horizontal</p>
<p>Plug Moisture: Plug has always remained moist</p>
<p>Pest: No presence of weeds or pests</p>
<p>Winter Buds: Present</p>
<p>In addition, seedlings with forked tops, have evidence of disease or other undesirable traits will not be planted. Un-plantable seedlings are NOT to be planted. Any un-plantable seedling used will be counted as improperly planted.</p>
<p>Do not sort or cull seedlings prior to actual planting time. Cull un-plantable seedlings only when the individual seedling is removed from the planter's bag for planting. At that time, drop the un-plantable seedling on the ground. Unusual amounts of plantable seedlings that are discarded will be counted as wasted seedlings and subjected to financial penalties.</p>
<p>2.52 Detailed Instructions</p>
<p>Correct planting of containerized seedlings, step by step, is as follows:<br />Step 1 At the proper spacing within the row, pick a location and scalp (remove leaves, litter, duff, etc.) a suitable planting spot to mineral soil;<br />Step 2 Insert the entire usable tip of the planting tool straight down into the soil at the center of the planting spot;<br />Step 3 Place the containerized seedling in the hole so that the root collar is located at the ground level but not more than &frac12; inch below the scalped ground level; ensure that the terminal bud is equal to or slightly above the surface of the scalped ground. Do not shake off or remove soil that is contained within the seedling plug.<br />Step 4 After inserting and compressing the tree seedling, fill depression with &frac12; of soil to cover the growing medium at the top of the root plug, This will prevent the root mass from "wicking" or drying out . This step is essential for satisfactory planting. Be careful not to step on the seedling during this operation.<br />2.6 - Care and Handling of Seedlings</p>
<p>The Contractor must protect the seedlings and take precautions to prevent damage to them from the time they are received by the Contractor until they are planted. This shall include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>Seedlings shall be protected at all times from drying, heating, smothering, freezing, crushing, drowning, abrasion, rapid temperature fluctuations or contact with injurious substances, i.e. gasoline, oil, or diesel fuel.</p>
<p>Boxes/bags/bundles of seedlings must be kept in the shade in the open air while in the field. The Contractor will provide, as a minimum, a light colored, heat reflective tarpaulin to cover seedlings during transport and field storage. Seedlings shall not be stored in a closed vehicle.</p>
<p>Do not build a warming fire within 100 feet of area where seedlings are stored or handled.</p>
<p>Boxes/bags/bundles of seedlings should not be thrown, stepped on, sat on, or otherwise abused at any time.</p>
<p>Boxes/bags/bundles of seedlings must stay sealed prior to planting, and only one box/bag/bundle shall be open at a time. Quickly remove only enough seedlings to fill planting bags to be carried by planters; seedlings should not be exposed to the elements for more than two minutes. Partial boxes/bags/bundles must be resealed to prevent moisture loss using a clamp, cord or by other effective means. Damaged or torn boxes/bags. Bundles must be immediately repaired to prevent moisture loss.</p>
<p>Planters shall not carry more than a one-hour supply of seedlings in their seedling bags. Planting bags should not be over-filled to the point where "packing" occurs.</p>
<p>Contractors supplied planting bags to be carried by planters, shall be of a light color, should not retain water or heat, have a minimum depth of 15 inches, be free of defects or contaminates, and should be constructed to allow easy and unrestricted extraction of tree seedlings, one at a time. Planters shall not carry any seedlings in their hands between planting spots. Seedlings should only be removed from the planting bag when a hole for the seedling has been made.</p>
<p>If any of the conditions are outside of the following range of preferred weather conditions, then the Contractor will take additional precautionary measures as directed by the Forest Service when handling, transporting, and while on site in the project area:</p>
<p>Air Temperature: 33 - 75 degrees F <br />Relative Humidity: 30 - 50 percent <br />Wind Speed: no more than 15 miles per hour</p>
<p>All seedling bags, wrappers, boxes, empty container or other debris resulting from the Contractor's planting activity shall be removed from the project area and transported back to the Forest Service Work Center for proper disposal.</p>
<p>2.4 Equipment Requirements</p>
<p>Equipment used must be a dibble bar style plug cutter, not a solid shank, capable of creating a hole that containerized seedlings can be planted in as described previously in section 2.52 Detailed Instructions. Hodads, sticker bars or any other similar planting tools will not be permitted for use.</p>
<p>2.5 Access</p>
<p>Any vehicular use of closed roads must be approved by the COR. The contractor is responsible<br />for repair of any damage (rutting, excessive soil exposure, etc.) caused by vehicles.</p>
<p>2.6 Debris Removal<br /><br />All slash deposited by the contract crew(s) shall be removed from all roads within and out of the project areas.</p>
<p><br />C.03 INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for inspecting his own work and correcting any deficiencies (reference FAR Clause 52.246-4 Inspection of Services). Government inspections are for the purpose of determining areas accepted for payment. Government Inspection of work performance under this contract shall be made by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) or the designated inspector as the work progresses at such intervals as are necessary to insure compliance with the contract specifications and provisions.</p>
<p>All contract areas will be sampled to determine the number of seedlings properly and improperly planted. Sampling will consist of 1/100th acre plots taken at a minimum rate of one per acre on a grid basis over the entire area. Natural seedlings and seedlings planted in a previous season will not be counted. The total number of properly planted seedlings per acre will be derived from the average of the results of the sample plots taken in the area.<br />Upon completion of work on an area, the contractor shall notify the COR that work on the area is completed and the COR shall make an overall inspection of the work completed. If the work completed is accepted, the Contractor shall proceed with work on the next area. If the work is not accepted by the COR, the Contractor shall complete any remedial work required prior to commencing work on the next area.</p>
<p>An area will be accepted for payment when the number of property reported seedlings per acre is between the minimum and the maximum number for the designated spacing as shown in Section 220. The spacing seedlings must also be adequately uniform over the entire contract area before the area will be accepted.</p>
<p>3.1 Unsatisfactory Work</p>
<p>In the event any or the work does not meet the specifications through the fault or negligence of the Contractor, such work shall, upon request of the COR, be made to conform to specifications by the Contractor at his expense. Cost of re-inspection by the Government will be charged to the Contractor.</p>
<p>3.2 Basis of Payment</p>
<p>3.21- Payment for Completed Areas</p>
<p>Full payment at the unit price bid will be made for all areas accepted in accordance with Section C.03.<br />An area may be accepted for reduced payment if the number of properly planted seedlings per acre is at least 90 percent of the minimum stated in Section C-.02. A payment reduction of 1 percent from the unit price will be made for each percentage that the number of properly planted seedlings falls below the minimum. An area will not be accepted if the number of properly planted seedlings falls below 90 percent of the required minimum per acre.<br />Payment will only be made for completed and accepted areas. No payment will be made for partially completed areas.<br />3.22 - Deductions<br />A deduction at the rate of $48 per thousand for Longleaf will be made for:</p>
<p>1. Dead, Damaged, lost, stolen, or wasted seedlings, excluding un-plantable seedlings.</p>
<p>2. Seedlings planted in excess of the maximum number per acre.</p>
<p>3. Unplanted seedlings kept in storage longer that the acceptable viability period. This deduction will be made when seedlings have been ordered and stored based on the contractor's schedule, but have not been planted due to delays within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>A deduction based on replacement cost to the Government will be made for government furnished property (other than seedlings) not returned at the end of the contract performance.</p>
<p>See FAR Clause 52.246.4, Inspection of Service, regarding deductions for work not conforming to contract requirements.</p>

<p>Cost/Price is of equal importance compared to the technical criteria which includes the experience with this type of work, past performance and key personnel. However, the importance of price may become greater as the difference between price and the technical criteria decreases. Where the technical evaluation criteria are substantially equal, price may control award. All technical criteria are essentially equal in importance to each other.</p>
<p><br />Bidders must provide information identified in Section B</p>
<p>PRICE REASONABLENESS <br />All offers must include reasonable prices. The Contracting Officer may reject all offers containing prices determined to be unreasonably low.</p>

If this contract is covered by the EO, the contractor must provide employees with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work, up to 56 hours of paid sick leave each year. Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their own illness, injury or other health-related needs, including preventive care; to assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is ill, injured, or has other health-related needs, including preventive care; or for reasons resulting from, or to assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is the victim of, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections under the EO is available at<br />www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.<br />ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $4.41 per hour or $176.40 per week or $764.40 per month</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE EO 13706: $4.13 per hour, or $165.20 per week, or $715.87 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or successor, 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (See 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, <br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR<br />4.174)</p>
<p><br />** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract (either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear" materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p><br />** NOTES APPLYING TO THIS WAGE DETERMINATION **</p>
<p>Under the policy and guidance contained in All Agency Memorandum No. 159, the Wage and Hour Division does not recognize, for section 4(c) purposes, prospective wage rates and fringe benefit provisions that are effective only upon such contingencies as "approval of Wage and Hour, issuance of a wage determination, incorporation of the wage determination in the contract, adjusting the contract price, etc." (The relevant CBA section) in the collective bargaining agreement between (the parties) contains contingency language that<br />Wage and Hour does not recognize as reflecting "arm's length negotiation" under section 4(c) of the Act and 29 C.F.R. 5.11(a) of the regulations. This wage determination therefore reflects the actual CBA wage rates and fringe benefits paid under the predecessor contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition (Revision 1), dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE<br />Standard Form 1444 (SF-1444)</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(i)). Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees (See 29 CFR<br />4.6(b)(2)(ii)). The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iv)(C)(vi)). When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE)for each proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of <br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination.<br />FSAR 4G52.222-701 Employment of Eligible Workers (DEC 1999)</p>
<p>Section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USC 1324a) makes it unlawful for an employer to hire unauthorized aliens. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has established the Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification Form, as the document to be used for employment eligibility verification (see 8 CFR 274a).</p>
<p>The contractor is required to (1) have all employees complete and sign the I-9 Form to certify that they are eligible for employment; (2) examine documents presented by the employee and ensure the documents appear to be genuine and related to the individual; (3) record information about the documents on the form, and complete the certification portion of the form; (4) retain the form for three years, or one year past the end of employment of the individual, whichever is longer.</p>
<p>It is illegal to discriminate against any individual (other than a citizen of another country who is not authorized to work in the United States) in hiring, discharging, or recruiting because of that individual's national origin or citizenship status.</p>
<p>Compliance with Section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a) is a material condition of the contract. If the contractor employs unauthorized workers during contract performance in violation of section 274A, the Government may terminate the contract, in addition to other remedies or penalties prescribed by law.</p>
<p>For further information on the requirements of the Act, contractors should contact the Employer and Labor Relations Officer of their local INS office.</p>
<p>FSAR 4G52.222-702 Labor Standards for Contracts Involving Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers (DEC 1999)</p>
<p>(a) General. This contract is subject to the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Protection Act (MSPA) (29 U.S.C 1801-1872) and to Department of Labor regulations implementing MSPA (see 29 CFR 500). The purpose of MSPA is to eliminate activities that are detrimental to migrant and seasonal agricultural workers, to require registration of farm labor contractors, and to assure necessary protections for the workers. In addition to traditional farm labor activities, the Act applies to predominately manual forestry work including, but not limited to, tree planting, release, pre-commercial thinning, and site preparation and wildland fire fighting.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions.</p>
<p>"Migrant Agricultural Worker" and "Seasonal Agricultural Worker", as used in this clause, mean individuals employed in agricultural (including forestry) work on a seasonal or temporary basis. A worker who moves from one seasonal activity to another is employed on a seasonal basis even though the worker may continue to be employed during a major portion of the year. Migrant workers are required to be absent overnight from their permanent place of residence. Seasonal workers are not required to be absent overnight from their permanent place of residence. Members of the contractor's immediate family are not considered to be either migrant or seasonal workers. "Immediate family" includes only (1) spouse; (2) children, stepchildren, or foster children; (3) parents, stepparents, or foster parents; and (4) brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>"Farm Labor Contractor", as used in this clause, means an individual who, for any money or other valuable consideration, paid or promised to be paid, performs any recruiting, soliciting, hiring, employing, furnishing, or transporting of any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker.</p>
<p>(c) Registration Requirement. Any contractor who provides or hires migrant or seasonal workers to perform agricultural or manual forestry work shall first obtain a Certificate of Registration from the Department of Labor or an authorized State agency. The contractor shall carry the Certificate at all times while engaged in contract performance, and shall display it upon request. Any of the contractor's employees who also perform any one or more of the activities defined for a "Farm Labor Contractor" in paragraph (b) must have their own Farm Labor Contractor Employee Certificate.</p>
<p>(d) Worker Protections. The contractor shall comply with the following protections and standards related to wage disclosure, recordkeeping, vehicle safety, and housing:</p>
<p>(1) The contractor shall display and maintain at the place of employment the MSPA poster provided by the Department of Labor.</p>
<p>(2) Wage and Payroll Standards</p>
<p>(i) The contractor shall disclose in writing to each worker in a language common to the worker the full terms of their employment, including workers compensation information, at the time they are recruited or hired. The Department of Labor provides an optional form WH-516 for contractor's use in disclosure.</p>
<p>(ii) The contractor must keep the following payroll records for each employee: name, address, social security number, basis for wages (i.e. per hour, per tree, per acre), number of units earned if paid on a per unit basis, hours worked, total pay, withholdings and purpose for each, and net pay. Payroll records shall be retained for three years.</p>
<p>(iii) Payments must be made no less frequently than every two weeks or semi-monthly. At the time of each payment, the contractor shall provide to the employee a written itemization of the information listed above and which shall include the employer's tax identification number.</p>
<p>(iv) If paid on a piece rate basis, the employee's wage must be at least equivalent to the required hourly wage for the hours worked, including overtime differential for time in excess of 40 hours per week.</p>
<p>(3) Motor Vehicle Safety</p>
<p>(i) The contractor must be registered to transport employees, unless employees provide their own transportation or carpool by their own arrangement in one of their own vehicles. The authorization to transport employees must appear on the contractor's certificate. If the contractor directs or requests employees to carpool, the registration requirement is still applicable. Any driver who transports workers for a fee or at the direction of the contractor must be registered as a farm labor contractor or a farm labor contractor employee.</p>
<p>(ii) Any vehicle under the ownership or control of the contractor shall comply with safety standards applicable to that vehicle. Generally passenger vehicles or station wagons must comply with Department of Labor regulations at 29 CFR 500.104. Vehicles other than passenger vehicles or station wagons which are driven more than 75 miles must comply with Department of Transportation Regulations at 29 CFR 500.105. All drivers must have a current, valid State driver's license.</p>
<p>(iii) Each vehicle under the ownership or control of the contractor which is used to transport any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker shall be covered by vehicle insurance of $100,000 per seat (maximum $5,000,000). A workers compensation policy which covers the workers while being transported plus an additional property damage policy for $50,000 for loss or damage in any one accident to the property of others may be substituted for the vehicle insurance requirement.</p>
<p>(4) Housing</p>
<p>(i) The contractor shall house workers only in a commercial establishment or a facility that has been certified by a health authority or other appropriate agency. The contractor must post the certificate of occupancy at the housing site.</p>
<p>(ii) The authorization to furnish housing, other than commercial lodging, must appear on the contractor's certificate.</p>
<p>(e) For further information on the requirements of the Act, contractors should contact their local Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor.</p>
<p>FSAR 4G52.222-703 Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act Registration (DEC 1999)</p>
<p>The Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) (29 U.S.C. 1801-1872) and implementing regulations issued by the Department of Labor (29 CFR 500), require any employer who hires or anticipates hiring employees subject to MSPA to obtain an MSPA registration number.</p>
<p>If the contractor employs or anticipates hiring employees subject to MSPA, the contractor shall provide a valid U.S. Department of Labor MSPA Registration Number to the Contracting Officer within 10 days after notification of award of the contract.</p>
<p>The Government may demand that the contractor display MSPA registration at any time during contract performance if it appears that the contractor is employing workers subject to MSPA. On demand, the contractor shall display its MSPA registration or state why it is exempt from MSPA.</p>
<p>Compliance with MSPA is a material condition of the contract. If the contractor fails to provide a valid MSPA number in accordance with this clause, or falsely states that it is exempt from the MSPA, the Government may terminate the contract, in addition to other remedies or penalties prescribed by law.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Division of Intramural Research (DIR) and Vaccine Research Center (VRC) require qualified and experienced personnel to support a full-range of activities, including new and in-progress research projects, program deployment and implementation, ongoing management and operations, and other activities necessary to conduct the business of the NIAID's research program. NIAID conducts and supports basic, translational and clinical research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. Infectious diseases include global killers such as human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), tuberculosis (TB), and malaria; emerging and re-emerging threats such as influenza, novel pathogenic coronaviruses (e.g., Middle East respiratory syndrome), Ebola, Zika, chikungunya, multidrug-resistant bacteria (e.g., multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB); and "deliberately emerging" threats from potential agents of bioterrorism. Immune-mediated disorders include autoimmune diseases such as lupus and type 1 diabetes; asthma; allergies; and graft rejection and other problems associated with tissue and organ transplantation. <br /><br />For more than 60 years, NIAID research has led to new therapies, vaccines, diagnostic tests and other technologies that have improved the health of millions of people in the US and around the world. The scope of NIAID research portfolio has expanded considerably in recent years in response to new challenges such as bioterrorism, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, and the increase of asthma prevalence among children in this country. <br /><br />The Government intends to increase the current ceiling of contract HHSN272201500015I by $49,000,000.00 from $130,023,570.00 to $179,023,570 for services in support of the NIAID DIR and VRC. It is estimated that a follow-on contract for the services described below will be solicited and awarded no later than September of 2018. <br /><br />This is a non-personal services contract to provide Professional, Scientific, and Technical Support Services for the DIR and the VRC. <br /><br />The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, other items and non-personal services necessary to provide technical support in the areas as defined in the Performance Work Statement except for those items specified as Government-furnished property and services; 1) Scientific research and analysis support; 2) Bioinformatics and computational biology; 3) Scientific and technical writing; 4) Scientific and medical domain expertise; 5) Scientific and research data management; 6) Laboratory management and support; 7) Scientific project management; 8) Information systems support; and 9) Clinical support services. <br />The contractor shall perform to the standards in this contract. <br /><br />The contractor must demonstrate the ability to, upon immediate request, recruit and maintain a stable, highly specialized and experienced staff with advanced degrees (M.D. and Ph.D.) in biomedical research in metropolitan Washington, D.C. as well as rural regions such as Hamilton, Montana. In addition, the contractor must demonstrate the ability to quickly provide staffing for research in high containment BSL (Biosafety Level) 3 and BSL 4 environments. The contractor must demonstrate prior experience in supporting clinical trials within the US as well as Africa, India and other countries. When needed, the contractor is required to attract and retain foreign scientists and must demonstrate the ability to sponsor work visas and provide permanent residence assistance for employees and their families. The contractor will need to demonstrate prior experience in all requirements stated above and in supporting employee growth and development by providing training and education assistance as well as supporting attendance and participation at scientific conferences. Administratively, the contractor is required to demonstrate the ability to provide a dedicated program management staff with experience and skill in similar activities of comparable scope and complexity as well as a corporate infrastructure to accommodate a contract of this size and complexity. <br /><br />The NIAID intends to negotiate, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306.302-1, on a sole source basis, with Medical Science and Computing, Inc., an increase the current ceiling of contract HHSN272201500015I by $49,000,000.00 from $130,023,570.00 to $179,023,570.

<div><br /><br />-Note #1:</div>
<div>NOAA currently receives R&amp;D HPCC systems integration services through Contract No. DG1330-10-CQ-0014 with CSRA, LLC. The current contract period expires May 06, 2018, with an additional one (1) year transition option available for support from May 07, 2018 - May 06, 2019. Similar to the anticipated follow-on contract, the current contract is a single-award IDIQ with FFP and T&amp;M task and delivery ordering capabilities.</div>
<div><br />-Note #2:</div>
<div>In Spring 2016, on the basis of Market Research, NOAA engaged vendors in the HPC industry to obtain feedback concerning the prospect of combining NOAA's follow-on R&amp;D HPCC and operational HPCC acquisition requirements into a single contracting vehicle. Historically, NOAA has issued separate contracts to support these programs. NOAA hereby advises that a combined acquisition approach, wherein the R&amp;D HPCC Program and the Weather and Climate Operational Supercomputing System (WCOSS) Program are supported through one (1) contract vehicle, WILL NOT be pursued at this time. Therefore, unless otherwise stated, the R&amp;D HPCC Program and the WCOSS Program will be supported via separate contracts for their respective follow-on efforts.</div>

<p>Fort Point National Historical Site<br />Repair Leaks in North Barbette Tier and Repoint North Exterior Wall and Interior Casements</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 238140</p>
<p>Estimated Cost Range: $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00</p>
<p>Estimated Period of Performance: Spring 2018 - Spring 2019</p>
<p>Project Description<br />Fort Point is a large third system Civil War fort constructed of brick and granite. It is listed as a contributing structure in the Presidio of San Francisco National Historic Landmark (NHL) District, identified as a nationally significant on the National Register of Historic Places when created in 1970. <br />It is the sole purpose for the creation of Fort Point National Historic Site. Fort Point, along with the fortification of Alcatraz Island, was constructed to protect gold shipments through the Golden Gate. It is the only Civil War Era Fort on the West Coast. As a NHL, Fort Point is to be given the highest level of protection providing under the National Historic Preservation Act and the federal regulations (36 CFR Part 800) that govern NPS procedures under the law.<br />The annual visitation to the fort is 500,000 including school children, tour groups, visitors to the Bay Area, and local residents. Activities include cannon demonstrations, a video presentation, ranger programs, and an audio tour. Fort Point is a specific destination in the Bay Area for those who are interested in the surprising Civil War history of San Francisco and California. If a major earthquake occurs in the Bay Area, Fort Point will be closed, and could be lost forever. These predictions are based on a recent structural evaluation, and on USGS statistics on the likelihood of a major earthquake (75 percent over the next 20 years). <br />Fort Point is the only fort of its type on the West Coast. It is the preeminent place to tell the story of the struggle for California Confederacy. For most of the school children as well as other visitors to the fort, this may be their only direct contact with Civil War history. The project directly supports Fort Point's enabling legislation, and the National Historic Preservation Act, which requires the NPS to provide special protection of National Historic Landmark contributing structure.<br />Currently the rainwater is infiltrating the casemates of the Fort from the barbette tier and is causing damage to the brick, mortar, as well as to the casemate finishes. Without stopping the infiltration of the water from the barbette tier (roof of the third tier casemates), re-pointing the mortar will not last and the brick will come loose. The fort is a masonry load bearing structure that depends on the masonry being in good condition for its structural strength. The mortar is in serious need of repair and replacement. The maritime weather conditions and the alga growth on the exterior walls are causing the deterioration of the brick and mortar. The repairs described above are needed to help preserve and maintain this National Register Property which is a contributing structure to both the Presidio of San Francisco National Historic Landmark District and a potential Seacoast Fortification National Historic Landmark District. Fort Point National Historic Site was created in 1970 by an Act of Congress to "preserve and interpret for future generations the historical significance of Fort Point." The work is also necessary to maintain the masonry vaults and facings in good condition to protect the public and employees from falling hazards of loose brick and mortar. Additionally, the fort is in a high seismic hazard zone and has survived three major earthquakes, although with damage requiring repair. Masonry structures are extremely vulnerable to seismic events especially if their masonry is not in good condition. The risk to the public and staff is from falling hazards due to falling masonry and/or structural collapse. The public will be much better protected if the masonry is maintained in good condition..</p>
<p>Bonding Capability <br />Interested firms MUST provide a letter from their bonding company to confirm their bonding capacity.</p>
<p>Capability Statements will be evaluated on the following Evaluation Criteria: <br />1) Experience performing the following work<br />a. Masonry and masonry re-pointing<br />b. Horizontal and structural concrete work<br />c. Site Civil (including excavation and hauling of overburden)<br />d. Brick Masonry<br />e. Working within harsh wind/rain conditions<br />f. Masonry washing and cleaning in an environmentally sensitive area<br />2) Relevance of Project Experience to this Project<br />a. Historic and Natural resource protection<br />b. Work for National Park Service or projects with similar requirements<br />c. Culturally-Sensitive projects<br />d. Work or rehabilitation on large brick masonry projects.<br />e. Work with large scaffolding structures</p>

The notification will include whether the contractor's Standard Form 330 (SF330) will be used, or if the government requires unique experience or qualifications to be submitted for the task order evaluation. Specialized experience and technical competence, professional qualifications, past performance, capacity, and knowledge of locality will be considered for task orders to determine which firm is best qualified to accomplish the work. In the event two firms are technically equal based on the previously listed selection criteria, secondary criteria will be considered.</p>

<DESC>Single Source Justification for SAP under $150K

OFOC SOP Revision 03   Page 1 of 1
Revision 03 Date: 10/27/2014
 JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
640-18-1-5051-0027
1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
640-18-901
1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$20,000.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

This is a construction project retrofit of the existing main water piping system in the Defender s Lodge, Building 9 at the VA Palo Alto Healthcare System.  The contractor shall perform work to complete repair of the building s main water system.

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

Due the urgency of this requirement, solicitation is no longer warranted for competitive procedures.  Temporary measures were implemented to stabilize the water pressure and stop the water leak from the broken pipe.  Permanent corrective actions are required to prevent complete loss of water pressure to the building.  Per VAAR 819.7007 and VAAR 819.7008 allows COs to award a contract to verified SDVOSB or VOSB using other than competitive procedures.

4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
The Defender s Lodge is highly utilized in this facility.  Loss of water pressure will prevent use of the facility for the veterans seeking care in the VA hospital. The prolonged competitive solicitation will delay the corrective actions needed.  Per VAAR 819.7007 and VAAR 819.7008 allows COs to award a contract to verified SDVOSB or VOSB using other than competitive procedures.

5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
GSA search for local SDVOSB and VIP list of SDVOSB and VOSB.
6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
 
Signature:                                                                              Date: 01-12-2018

Additional support is not anticipated during the extension period. These contractors provide highly specialized expertise in a variety of professional acquisition capabilities which cannot be obtained from the Government's current and limited organic resources. The types of services include but are not limited to a full spectrum of Acquisition Support, Project Management, Technical Evaluation, Master Planning and Scheduling, Source Selection, Training, Resource Management, Data Manager, and Administrative support. The acquisition advisory assistance and support services encompass all stages of systems life cycle from capability-based analysis and concept development through deployment, sustainment, and production activities.</span></p>

Any loss in PASS II contractor support would negatively impact the execution and schedule of initiatives supporting SAF/AQ, SAF/FM, SAF/A4, and Air Force Materiel Command, ultimately putting the mission and war-fighter at risk. HIC support to the acquisition, financial, logistics and other communities is vital in maintaining needed support as well as developing defense business systems to replace outdated legacy systems.</span></p>
