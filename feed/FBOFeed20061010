<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement #DTPH56-07-BAA-0001
Welding and Joining Research and Development


This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) seeks white papers on Research and Development projects addressing pipeline safety program areas described more fully below. 

Background

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) conducted a Government/Industry Advanced Welding and Joining Technical Workshop at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado on January 25-26, 2006.  The 2.5 day event included approximately 65 representatives from Federal, State and international government agencies, public representatives, research funding organizations, standards organizations, and pipeline operators from the U.S. and Canada.  The workshop led to a common understanding of current research efforts, a listing of key challenges facing government and industry, and a compilation of potential research areas whose exploration can help meet these challenges and should therefore be considered in the development of new research and development (R&D) applications.  Only topics described in this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and identified at the workshop will be addressed.  Not all topics identified at the workshop may fit within PHMSA?s mission and may not be represented in this BAA.  PHMSA?s R&D Program is focused on quantifying research in development of technology, strengthening consensus standards and providing general knowledge.  This BAA seeks projects advanced beyond proof-of-concept with a projected path to market in a short term (1-3 years) as the outputs are transferred to end users. Further details on the solicited research topics can be found in the R&D forum proceedings and technical report-out presentations.  To view the R&D forum proceedings and technical report-out presentations, please visit: http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/rd/mtg_012506.htm .
 
To gain a historical perspective of the PHMSA?s Pipeline Safety R&D goals, strategy and several previous pipeline stakeholder events as well as descriptions of all awarded research, visit the PHMSA Pipeline Safety R&D Program webpage at: http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/rd/ .


GENERAL INFORMATION

PHMSA is seeking white papers on individual projects and on consolidated R&D programs that address the solicited pipeline safety program areas identified in this BAA.  The research team members could include technology developers, construction organizations, appliers, pipeline operators and, if appropriate, standards development organizations.  A consolidated R&D program white paper is a white paper submitted by a team lead organization and identifies opportunities for integrated R&D involving contributions from several organizations whose combined expertise will contribute greater efficiency and effectiveness to R&D in the proposed program areas.  Details of the intent of the listed projects can be located in the workshop proceedings and technical report-out presentations, shown at: http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/rd/mtg_012506.htm.  Examples of program and project focus within the desired program areas are as follows:

1. Improving Weld Design in High Strength Steel Pipe

A project or program could develop a comprehensive set of testing methods for mechanical strength properties to include: deciding what data is necessary for Weld Material (WM) and Base Material (BM); defining what process is used to attain that data; procedures that demonstrate validation of data acceptability by specific industry standards; and making judgments on the value of test data based on that collected data.  A proposed project or program must also:
?	Develop acceptance criteria for establishing required inputs and information for different design methodologies; 
?	Develop acceptance criteria for filling in gaps in available Engineering Critical Assessment technologies to determine flaw acceptance criteria; 
?	Be stress-based to address Under-Matching and Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) softening in pipe steels in weld areas; 
?	Be strain-based to include methodologies for all steel grades; and defining limits of applicability;  
?	Develop testing methods for fracture toughness properties to get more relevant fracture data than standard Crack Tip Opening Displacement tests provide for HAZ and WM; 
?	Demonstrate a relationship between laboratory tests and full-scale tests; and
?	 Develop the essential variables required to update current welding standards covering qualification procedures for modern welding techniques and to ensure property consistency.

2. Developing Construction Practices for Welding High Strength Steel Pipe

A project or program could develop comprehensive fabrication standards for high strength steels.  The standards must address: the impact of using multiple batches to supply large projects with pipes; Engineering Critical Assessment technologies to determine fabrication flaws and flaw acceptance criteria for automated joining such as laser hybrid welding or Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAC) technology; the impact and importance of pipe end preparation; consumables; speed in which field welding can proceed; and path(s) forward to optimize joint design, automation of process monitoring and seam tracking technologies.

3. Weld Inspection, Assessments, Repair and Maintenance Methods for High Strength Steel Pipe

The project or program could develop advanced technologies or techniques to validate and implement methodology and/or Reliability Based Design and Assessment standards to quantify automated ultrasonic testing (AUT) systems and develop operator procedures for weld inspection applications. Projects could investigate, develop and/or quantify image capture capabilities; and establish guidance documents for AUT systems.  The research scope should quantify any advancement over existing technology or techniques.  Field tests using realistic operating conditions could be employed to benchmark application of the proposed technology or technique.  

4. Improving Joint Integrity and Assessment for Nonmetallic Materials

The project or program could collaborate with joint imagery technology under development and develop processes to improve current joining technologies for all joining types (saddle, butt, electro).  The project or program could improve process validation for equipment, and/or mitigate human error, and/or enhance communications between nonmetallic pipe manufactures and applicators in the field.  The project or program must also develop quicker methods or testing practices for accurately predicting the integrity/residual life of older PE pipe joints.  A key goal is technology or process application under field conditions.

WHITE PAPERS

PHMSA is seeking white papers on individual projects or consolidated programs that address the above specified pipeline safety program areas.  Interested parities must submit separate white papers for each proposed individual project.  Multiple individual projects are not to be combined into a single white paper.  A consolidated R&D program white paper from a team?s lead organization should identify opportunities for integrated R&D that could involve contributions from several organizations whose combined expertise will contribute greater efficiency and effectiveness to R&D in the proposed program areas.  

A response to this BAA must clearly identify the ultimate goals of the proposed program or project. Responses could contribute technology or knowledge to organizations that supply technology in the field or to organizations seeking to develop or update industry consensus standards. 

If a white paper reaches the full proposal stage, the proposal must include cost sharing contributions of at least fifty percent of the proposed project's cost to be considered. 

Each white paper must include the following contact information: point of contact, organization name and complete street address, organization DUNS number, organization Tax Identification Number (TIN), telephone number, fax number, and email address.
The entire white paper submission package, including the White Paper itself (5 pages maximum), and all attachments, appendices and backup materials, should not exceed a total of fifteen (15) pages.

The evaluation team will only read the first five (5) pages of each white paper and will evaluate the papers using the selection criteria listed below.   The offeror must address the selection criteria by providing sufficient information and by keeping the entire paper within the five (5) page limit.  Specifics on the selection criteria are as follows:

1.  Relevance to PHMSA?s mission and state of understanding.

?	Is the proposal relevant to PHMSA?s mission of safety and or environmental protection? 
?	How well does the proposal describe the challenge and or state how the approach will resolve the challenge? 
?	How well does the proposal describe related work done by others, status of any related technology developments or consensus standard revision done by others? 
?	How well does the proposal address related work done by the offeror either previously or currently?

?	How appropriate are costs to address objectives and deliver products within the proposed timeline? 
?	How appropriate are proposed levels of travel? 
?	How well is the project schedule defined? 
?	How appropriate is the schedule matched with the desired deliverable or output? 

4.  Coordination and collaboration of work scopes and deliverables?

?	How much does the proposal build upon previous or current work? 
?	How well does the proposal identify the deliverable type (i.e. technology development or standard development or general knowledge)? 
?	How well does the proposal identify who would use research results (i.e. end users)? 
?	How well does the proposal involve end users of the deliverable type into the work scope? 
?	How appropriate is the technology or knowledge transfer plan? 
?	How much discussion is provided whether the deliverable or output satisfies a current challenge or are additional tasks necessary before completion of project?
?	How well does the proposal identify management of a program area and the capability of the proposing organization to carry out the proposed program?

5.  Consolidated Program Justification (This criterion will be used during full proposal evaluation of Consolidated Programs only)

?	How well does the offeror define program goals and project objectives? 
?	How well does the offeror justify increased scientific and technical merit under their leadership? 
?	How well does the offeror articulate technical interrelation between individual projects? 
?	How well does the offeror use efficiencies of scale or organization structure as a technical or other advantage? 
?	How much more success is likely because a challenge is addressed through the proposed consolidated program versus individual projects?
  
All evaluation factors are of equal importance.

A technical evaluation panel will only review white papers received that address solicited topics in this BAA.  An offeror providing a white paper deemed worthy of further consideration and meeting the criteria of this BAA will be notified with possible suggestions for change in scope and detailed guidelines for submitting a full proposal for either individual or consolidated proposals.  The evaluation panel will again evaluate the proposal against the listed criteria.  

A proposal must include cost sharing contribution of at least fifty percent of the proposed project?s total cost to be considered.  A white paper only needs to include a ?ballpark? estimate including work force and cost share breakdown.  A full proposal must include detailed cost sharing contribution documentation including cost analysis and certified letters of commitment from project or program participants.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Army Communications-Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) Acquisition Center, Fort Monmouth, NJ 07753, on behalf of the US Army Project Manager, Distributed Common Ground System- Army (PM, DCGS-A), intends to acquire services and materials for further research and development of the imaging automated target cueing (IMaG-ATC) capability for broad area search for selected objects (targets) using multi-spectral imagery. The Department of Defense (DoD) has developed a conc ept and mandated a single, cohesive, multi-Service Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) Enterprise.  A key capability of the DCGS is the ability to receive and process imagery from multiple sources such that objects and potential targets can be quickly identified and reported into the Command and Control structure for further action.  In order to achieve this capability while reducing the operator workload and improving target detection requires imagery automated target cueing.  PM DCGS-A is moving rapid ly to field the DCGS-A system however the current automated target cueing technology cannot provide the necessary capability.  The proposed acquisition is intended to be a Research and Development Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (Level of Effort) type contract to be i ssued on a sole source basis to Susquehanna Resources and Environment, Inc., 84 Oak St, Binghampton, NY, 13905-3717.  SRE developed the propriety imagery algorithms of the IMaG-ATC. SRE is the owner of the applicable patents for the automatic imagery chang e detection algorithms for the software that performs the automatic imagery change detection.  The anticipated effort will be a one-year contract, with two (2) one (1) year options.  The solicitation number assigned to this effort is W15P7T-07-R-M201.  The  US Army C-E LCMC has established the IBOP website as a part of the Armys Single Face to Industry, to allow electronic posting of solicitation for Request for Proposals (RFP), Request for Quotations (RFQs), and Invitations for Bids (IFBs) from  C-E LCMC  to industry.

*       Helping children to develop and reach their full potential
*       Promoting health and well-being among people of all ages with disabilities
Activities for which task orders may be issued:
1. Development and Implementation of Training Programs

a.       Training Programs, relevant to the NCBDDD mission, would include development and delivery of Professional Education programs, Public Education Programs, Orientation and Skill-based programs to providers.     

b.       More specifically, the Contractor shall be required to perform the following types of training activities:

(1)     Develop course curriculum, including training materials, for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

(2) Provide qualified Instructors and/or Facilitators for specified topics as specified in individual Task Orders.

                   (10) Develop and implement a plan for evaluating the training materials/program


2,     Scientific Forums

NCBDDD serves as a convener and facilitator to bring many sectors of society together to solve problems related to the mission.     Sectors that NCBDDD routinely interacts with include other government agencies, health care professionals, business/industry, educational professionals, nongovernmental organizations, and advocacy groups interested in specific disease conditions or health topics.     NCBDDD wants to ensure that events/conferences are planned, implemented, and evaluated to achieve purposes that are aligned with its mission.     Scientific Forums on NCBDDD?s topics must involve constituents and scientists who may have     disease conditions and/or disabilities that the Center studies.     This often requires involvement of specialist interpreters (with scientific training) and/or technology aids that are not usual and customary in typical conference logistics contracts. The role of contract holders under this contract is to coordinate the activities surrounding the identification of potential conference/forum attendees and speakers and assisting in the development of topical materials/agendas, etc.

The Conference logistics will not be provided under this contract, but will be provided through vendors holding HHS conference support/event planning Blanket Purchase Agreements. Conference logistical support includes managing of events and meeting logistics including inviting participants and managing registration, travel, etc.; arranging for audio-visual and other special equipment, facilities arrangements including set up, back drop, sound systems, etc.

3. Preparation of Health Education Products

a.       The Contractor shall provide support for the preparation and production of materials as specified in individual task orders.     Support for any given item may range from simply typing and editing recorded, handwritten or draft-type materials to conducting all stages of development, including research, original writing, and design.     Capabilities to produce camera-ready copies and presentation slides of materials will be necessary.

b.       Because some tasks will require the collection of large amounts of information and user-friendly access to that information once collected, some initiatives may require development of small databases.     Both paper (camera-ready) copy and computer diskette files shall be made available for all documents in the format and computer program specified in the task order.     Examples of specific types of materials required by the Government may include meeting minutes and reports, guidance documents, policy reports, manuscripts, and other documents.

4. Services in the Planning and Development of Workshop, Conference and Other Presentations

The Contractor shall provide support services in organizing NCBDDD sponsored meetings, workshops, conferences, and other presentations as specified in individual task orders.

Services may include working with partners and/ or providers to develop curricula and materials, locating and arranging for qualified instructors, coordinating and providing exhibit materials, securing audio visual equipment, securing sign language interpreters and TDDY equipment for hearing impaired attendees; making other necessary accommodation for visually and physically impaired attendees, etc., when required by the task order.  Conference logistics will be provided by others.

<DESC>Q1:  Is there an applicable NAICs code?  What is it? A1:  Currently, the Government is only surveying the broad market for viable technologies. Should this survey ultimately result in the Government developing and issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) for respondents, a NAICS code will be assigned. Q2:  To whom should questions of a technical nature be directed?  Is there a program manager whose contact information you can provide? A2:  Any technical queries should be directed toward the posted point of contact. Q3:  Am I correct in assuming that any future contract resulting from any future procurement pursuant to this RFI would be a new requirement and thus have no incumbent contract? A3:  This is a new requirement and no incumbent exists. Q4:  Under GENERAL REQUIREMENTS section a) The proposed system can not be one that is already in use by the U.S. Government for protection of U.S. military personnel... We request further information, specifically are variants or modifications of systems which are currently protecting US Forces acceptable? A4:  Any proposed system that utilizes the same technical architecture as an existing United States Government system will be considered an unsuitable response to the RFI.  Q5:  If variants are acceptable, are variants/modifications with better performance desired if they are not currently being used to protect US Forces? A5:  Consistent with the previous answer, variant systems that are not 100% similar to a current USG system are acceptable. Q6:  If variants/modifications are not acceptable, please provide additional guidance as to what is considered to be a new system verse a variant of a current system. I.e.; percentage reuse of a current system, CPI etc. A6:  Given that an exact percentage break out of new vs. existent key components has not been identified, it is recommended that you speak with your service sponsor regarding the acceptability of your proposed/prospective variant. Q7:  Are Systems which are being evaluated for 2.1 which are currently which are not currently protecting US Forces acceptable? A7:  Yes, provided the current 2.1 system under evaluation is not 100% similar to a current USG system. It is recommended that you speak with your service sponsor regarding the acceptability of your proposed/prospective variant. Q8:  Could you please clarify whether the RFI, Solicitation Number: N0002407R6301, is associated with the United States JCREW spirals that were discussed at industry day on 26 Sept 06? Or is this a different acquisition just for Nations besides the United States? A8: No, this is a different acquisition. Q9:  Is this project the same as the one discussed at an unclassified portion of an Industry Day in Maryland?  A9: No, this is a different project.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Replacement Optical Encoder
<SOLNBR>RFI-001DT
<RESPDATE>103106

<CONTACT>Doris Turner, Purchasing Agent, Phone (303) 497-3872, Fax (303) 497-3163, Email doris.p.turner@noaa.gov
<DESC>This modification to RFI-001DT is to extend the response date to October 31, 2006.

The National Weather Service (NWS) is conducting market research for the replacement of the Optical Encoder in its NEXRAD Weather Surveillance Radar WSR-88D. The Optical Encoder provides elevation and azimuth position information for the WSR-88D antenna/pedestal assembly and is contained within the pedestal. The existing Optical Encoder is approaching obsolescence of its critical components. The existing Optical Encoder is model A1625H-14NB manufactured by Sequential Electronics Systems, Inc. The purpose of this RFI is to gather information from Encoder manufacturers relating to the availability of compatible Optical Encoders in the commercial market. The following are the pertinent characteristics of the existing Optical Encoder.

The Optical Encoder provides an output consisting of a 14 Bit (0.02 degree) resolution, 13 Bit (0.04 degree) accuracy providing absolute angle data in a serial natural binary format with the Least Significant Bit (LSB) first out.  A bite bit of Logic "1" in the Most Significant Bit (MSB) + 1 indicating normal operation and a Logic "0" to indicate an encoder failure.  A binary "1" is indicated by a minimum of 2.5 VDC at -20 mA. A binary "0" is indicated by a maximum of 0.5 VDC at 20 mA.

The inputs (read,clock) must have differential input impedance of 180 ohms minimum, a pulse width minimum of 0.5 micro-sec, an interrogation rate minimum of 5 kHz, a shift frequency minimum of 2.0 MHz. The rotation, for increasing count, should be clockwise facing the mounting surface or shaft end.  Power should be +5 Vdc +0.25/-0.50 Vdc at 1500 mA maximum.

The mechanical data should include solid shaft, self-contained electronics, and a starting/running torque of 1.5 oz-in maximum (@ 25 degrees C).

Once the encoder receives the read pulse, the time to the first data bit output (LSB) should not exceed 104 micro-seconds.

GENERAL: The NWS will not fund the development of a new design to support this requirement.  Responses to this market survey should only include products that support all stated requirements in a current commercially available configuration, or could be made fully compliant through minor modifications.  Responses to this market survey must include the device manufacturer, a product description with performance parameters, a statement regarding current availability, a statement describing any required modifications, and the estimated cost of the product including any required modifications. These cost estimates must include any non-recurring costs along with the cost for manufacture of 400 production units. This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotes. The NWS will use the results of this RFI to estimate expected cost and identify possible sources to support this future requirement. All information should be submitted to the following: Doris Turner, U.S. Dept. of Commerce/NOAA/ Mountain Region Acquisition Division, Fax: 303-497-3163 or e-mail: doris.p.turner@noaa.gov.  Responses should be received on or before October 31, 2006.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SS-ES-07-02
<RESPDATE>102306
<ARCHDATE>11062006
<CONTACT>Patrick Barbour, Contract Specialist, Phone 919-541-7596, Fax 301-451-5597, Email barbourp@niehs.nih.gov
<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO CHANGE THE RESPONSE DATE IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH TO REFLECT OCTOBER 23, 2006.

This notice is a revision of Reference No. SS-ES-06-08.
The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is requesting information to determine the availability of interested parties to provide support and interpretation of multimodality imaging capability, including but not limited to micro-CT, digital subtraction angiography, micro-PET, two-photon/one-photon confocal microscopy, and ultrasound imaging as well as operate an MRI and multimodality imaging facility for small rodent species in support for the NIEHS and the National Toxicology Program (NTP).  Based upon the location of the appropriate equipment, the contractor may be required to work off-site.

The Offeror shall provide support to:
1.  Operate a Government-furnished 7 Tesla MRI system which consists of a 210 mm bore Magnex Scientific superconducting magnet with shielded gradients, a GE Medical Systems EXCITE console, and RF subsystems specific for imaging small laboratory rodent species. 

2. Maintain and extend the capability of this system as required by the NIEHS for extended capabilities such as increased spatial resolution, specific tissue contrast, and high specimen throughput.

3.  Perform MR imaging of rodent tissue specimens at a spatial resolution that is more than 300,000X greater than that routinely used on clinical imaging systems. The field of view for imaging may be directed at observations of the whole animal (e.g. mouse embryos or fetuses) and specific functional systems and /or organs (e.g. mouse brains, heart, lungs). This will entail; a.) The use of specialized tissue preparation methods for specimen fixation (use of alternate contrast agents, perfusion fixation), b.) Manufacture of specialized radiofrequency coils, and c.) Integration of unique image acquisition strategies and novel reconstruction methods to allow rapid acquisition (acquisition times of < 3 hrs) of very large high-quality image arrays (> 4 GB/image) with isotropic 3D spatial resolution < 25 microns. Tissue specimens shall be prepared in a manner that would permit subsequent evaluation of tissues by conventional histology following imaging.  Additional modalities for imaging small laboratory rodents such as micro-CT, ultra sound, molecular imaging and other specialized optical modalities may be required. The Contractor shall develop and operate such systems as appropriate for small animal (rodent) imaging in support of NIEHS studies.

4.  Perform longitudinal (in vivo) imaging studies in which the same animal(s) is/are imaged at multiple times to observe the time course and response (temporal pathogenesis and/or recovery) and pathology (development of anatomic features such as tumor growth) associated with exposure to xenobiotics.  Such studies shall require the use of specialized equipment and procedures for animal support structures and anesthesia to minimize motion, careful control of body temperature, and radiofrequency coils adapted to the very high magnetic field environment. 

5.  Provide and/or use a government furnished web-accessible digital electronic system for managing the access, review, downloading, and the archive of digital image data files and collateral documents pertaining to scientific imaging studies. The system must have the capacity to handle an exceptionally broad range of digitized imagery including conventional histology, very large 3D image arrays generated in MR histology, microCT, microPET, power point presentations, scanned images and other imagery, data, and collateral documentation. This scientific imaging management system must include the capability of enabling any user at NIEHS to access the images, data sets, and collateral documents from multiple sites with commonly used personal computers and modes of Internet access. 

6.  Provide expertise/advice concerning rodent magnetic resonance image acquisition strategy, MRI image quality, and its biological and/or scientific significance.  Participate in interpretation of the generated images and/or provide training in sample preparation and/or image interpretation for NIEHS investigators.

7.  The contractor shall maintain compliance with Federal, State and Local laws, and NIH regulations such as the following: 1) The Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-544 as amended in 1970, 1976, and 1985) http://www.nal.usda.gov; 2) Standard Operating Procedures for Laboratory Animal Management that conform to the most recent versions of PHS and other public guidance. 3) NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW); 4) Association For Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC); 5) NIEHS Laboratory Health and Safety Minimum Requirement for Contractors; 6) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC, 1996); 7) FDA Good Laboratory Practices for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies (CFR 21 Part 85).

MANDATORY QUALIFICATIONS: The following mandatory qualification criteria must be met at the time of award:  1) the contractor shall provide an imaging facility, equipment except for magnet and APPROPRIATE staff dedicated exclusively to support of NIEHS/NTP studies; 2) the facility shall be located within a 30 to 45 minute driving time of the NIEHS main campus, 111 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709; 3) the facility shall be accessible to NIEHS/NTP scientists; 4) all components of the Imaging Facility and the support areas including offices, and laboratories and a facility for temporary housing of small laboratory rodents in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act of 1966 (PL89-544) shall be located on one  site.

For estimating purposes the Government estimates the level-of effort at 5,850 direct labor hours per year as follows:  Professional  2,500 direct labor hours; Professional Support  1,000 direct labor hours; Technical  2,200 direct labor hours; Administrative Support  150 direct labor hours. 

INTERESTED OFFERORS SHOULD SUBMIT (5) COPIES OF THEIR CAPABILITY STATEMENT NOT TO EXCEED FIFTEEN (15) PAGES IN LENGTH, EXCLUDING STANDARD BROCHURES, ETC., FOR RECEIPT BY THE AGENCY ON October 23, 2006.  Please submit information to Patrick J. Barbour, Contract Specialist, NIEHS/OM/OA, P.O. Box 12874, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709. Courier address: Patrick J. Barbour, Contract Specialist, NIEHS/OM/OA, 79 TW Alexander Drive, Building 4401, Research Commons, Suite 100, Research Triangle Park, NC  27709 Inquiries will be accepted by fax (301) 451-5597 or e-mail barbourp@niehs.nih.gov

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) intends to solicit a proposal and negotiate a sole source contract with the Desert Research Institute (DRI) of the University and Community College System of Nevada to provide technical research, engineering, and development services to the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Legacy Management (OLM).  The proposed contract effort will involve environment, health, environmental restoration, engineering, chemistry, hydrology, geology, soil science, radiological sciences, environmental transport modeling, development and testing, compliance document support, and community and stakeholder outreach.  The total period of performance for the proposed contract is 5 years.  These services were recently  performed by DRI, under DOE contract DE-AC08-99NV13609. The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this proposed contract is found at Section 303(c)(1) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act, 10 USC 2304(c)(1), and implemented at FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii), which authorizes other than full and open competition when the proposed contract will â€œestablish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other non profit institution or a federally funded research and development centerâ€.  DRI, the not-for-profit research division of the University and Community College System of Nevada, was created in 1959 to conduct basic and applied research aimed at improving the scientific knowledge needed for effective management of Nevada's natural resources. DRIâ€™s current research programs involve many diverse fields of science and engineering, including hydrogeology, hydrologic engineering, atmospheric and biological sciences, and energy and environmental engineering. There are no solicitation documents available for this requirement. Any firm wishing to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates its status in the context of FAR 6.302-3(a)(2)(ii) and its ability to provide the services described above. Interested parties may submit a proposal and rationale as to why they should be considered by October 25, 2006 to: Mr. Randolph Kesling, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Legacy Management, MS â€“K09, 3610 Collins Ferry Road, Morgantown, WV 26507-0880. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive acquisition.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Synopsis is part of an Acquisition Market Research Analysis. The analysis will determine the extent competition will apply to the planned acquisition process. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION.  This is a market research tool to determine the availability, interest, and adequacy of potential sources to perform as the INTEGRATOR of a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) contract for maintenance and overhaul of J85 reparable engine components.  The PBL contract will require a Performance Based Agreement (PBA) establishing a partnership between the integrator and a government maintenance source for performance of the maintenance and overhaul ??touch labor??.

?X	Contractor Furnished Material for the latest configuration components, 
?X	Program unique Contractor Furnished Equipment,
?X	Reliability data collection,  and
?X	Technical analysis and coordination of reliability data with the government program office.  
The value of the anticipated PBL contract is expected to be a minimum of $170 million (FY07 dollars) over a ten year period.  The government plans to distribute equal firm-fixed-price payments per unit time over the PBL contract life.  It is anticipated in an attempt to maximize profits; the integrator will make capital investments on reliability enhancements at the beginning of the contract in order to reduce necessary maintenance expenditures in the later part of the contract.

Firms interested in responding to this announcement shall submit written synopses of their experience and capability to perform the tasks of an integrator as described above.

<DESC>The Ambulatory Care Services (ACS) Department in the Clinical Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland intends to procure on a sole source basis to Omega Travel to continue providing patient travel management services for the period of November 15, 2006 through May 14, 2007.   Requirements for travel services to be provided to patients include, but are not limited to, the following:

?	Must establish a separate onsite reservation center at the NIH Clinical Center, Building 10, in Bethesda, Maryland to service only patient transportation requirements.
?	Must implement a fee-based travel booking system with multiple methods for reservations including fax, e-mail, in person, and telephone.
?	Must provide a 24-hour staffed toll free number available to travelers to perform emergency itinerary changes and emergency services outside regular business hours. 
?	Must comply with established Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) and corresponding HHS and NIH travel and transportation policy and procedures, and with mandatory Government programs for air travel. 
?	Consistent with the constraints of the GSA city-pair contract program (41CFR 301-15), and the Fly America Act, the Contractor must offer to book the lowest publicly available fare.  These could include publicly available sale airfares that may be penalty airfares and publicly available consolidator fares. 
?	Must make reservations and issue tickets for patient travelers worldwide.
?	Must provide lodging reservations to include initiating and confirming reservations and confirming the rate at which the reservation was made.
?	Must use an automated accounting system with direct interface among the reservation, ticketing and accounting elements so that all passenger reports and summary data are automatically generated from point-of sale information.
?	Must be able to deal with a diverse population of patients, many of whom are inexperienced travelers and need to come to the NIH on short notice.
?	Must provide for each patient travel office employee a folder with the following information upon contract award to be readily available in the onsite patient travel office. 
		-	Job Description
		-	Core Competencies for the Position
		-	Annual Evaluation
		-	Documentation of Contractor and NIH Training

The travel needs of these patients and their families vary and can be quite complex.  These complexities include open tickets for return flights back to the NIH for future visits.  A vast majority of these patients interact, in person, with the travel agency staff.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 561599 (small business size standard is $5.0 million dollars).   
  
The contractor providing the services must have the requisite experience in providing the patient travel services as described above. Contractor must demonstrate experience in working with providing these travel services in a research hospital environment to a diverse range of patients who are not only being treated for a variety of diseases (AIDS, cancer, heart disease, neurological problems, hearing and sight problems, etc), but who also have physical impairments as a result of their disease and treatment, and who also may speak different language, including sign language.  Additionally, the contractor is required to have experience in working with patients who are inexperienced travelers with complex travel needs, including potential arrangement of international travel.   

It is believed that Omega Travel is the sole source for this requirement under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only 1 Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements) because of the following: The current Contractor understands the diversity of the patient population, the need to maintain patient confidentiality and the complexities of patient travel.  Each NIH Institute determines its own reimbursement policies and procedures which the Contractor must follow when making travel arrangement. Because each patient travel request is unique, the Contractor must pay particular attention to the details of patient requirements and Institute operational policies and procedures related to processing patient travel requests. The Contractor also understands the mandatory training requirements that are necessary when working in a health care environment and directly with patients. They ensure staff completion of mandatory training upon entry as well as completion of the annual training reviews.  This contractor has to ability and experience to ensure consistent service for patient travel so as to not impact the research mission of the NIH or patient care during the next six months while the five (5) year contract for these services is being established.

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  The capability statement shall be in sufficient enough detail so that the Government can determine the capability of your firm to provide the required services.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and a solicitation document will not be issued.  All capability statements received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed interim purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether ton conduct a competitive procurement.  See Numbered Note No. 22.

<ARCHDATE>12232007
<CONTACT>Mary Ann Mitchell, 410-436-0642
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis ONLY. Requests for copies of solicitation will not receive a response. The Joint Program Executive Officer for Chemical Biological Defense (JPEO-CBD) has a requirement for a Joint Material Decontamination System (JMD S) for use throughout the, U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy to provide the ability to decontaminate chemical and biological warfare agents from sensitive equipment and platform interiors without degradation of the equipment in an immediate, operational and thorough environment.. Sensitive equipment is high value or low density electronic or optic equipment that cannot be decontaminated using existing means without degradation of their functions.  Examples of critical sensitive equi pment are laptops, night vision goggles, and the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System.  Platform interiors refers to the interior decontamination of tactical platforms such as personnel carriers and small aircraft such as a single seat fighter plane, as well  as large platform interior decontamination such as interiors of buildings, ships and large aircraft, e.g., cargo aircraft.  The decontaminant portion of the technology will utilize a decontaminant in a gaseous phase with proven effectiveness against a bro ad spectrum of chemical and biological agents to include VX, GD, and HD, spores, vegetative bacteria and viruses.  The decontaminant formulation will not leave a residue requiring rinsing.  The decontaminant will be compatible with materials consistent wit h those found in sensitive equipment and platform interiors.  The system hardware will utilize commercially available components such as a pump, generator and environmental control that will be integrated to form the JMDS hardware system.  The hardware wil l convert the decontaminant from a liquid to a vapor.  The vapor will be pumped into an enclosure to fumigate/decontaminate the equipment.  The hardware will maintain conditions inside the enclosure to keep the decontaminant in a vaporous state.  The decon taminant will be recycled to circulate the vapor throughout the enclosure. The following Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) are applicable to this requirement and are provided for information purposes only. The format is title of KPP, Developmental Threshol d (DT) and Developmental Objective (DO). KPP 1- Efficacy, Thorough Decontamination.

Equipment degradation  DT-Decontaminated equipment will retain tactical mission capability following decontamination. DO-Decontamination will cause no equipment degradation. KPP 4.  Safety  DT-Equipment, subseque nt to decontamination, will not present a health or safety hazard to personnel. DO-Equipment, subsequent to decontamination, will not present a health or safety hazard to personnel. KPP 5 Decontamination process effectiveness DT- Contamination levels on sensitive equipment will be reduced to the threshold levels in KPP 1 greater than or equal to greater than 95% of the time after one decontamination process. DO-Contamination levels on sensitive equipment will be reduced to the threshold levels in KPP 1 greater than or equal to greater than 95% of the time after one decontamination process. KPP 6 Reliability DT-JMDS system(s) will have a reliability of greater than 0.85 DO-JMDS system(s) will have a reliability of greater than 0.98 Only companies which have the capability to provide the equipment required need to respond to this announcement.

<SUBJECT>Industry Day Announcement for a Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) Program, scheduled for 27 October 2006.
<DESC>This announcement is to invite industry to participate in a Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) industry day on 27 October 2006.  The industry day will be held in the Kossiakoff Center at the Applied Physics Laboratory/Johns Hopkins University (APL/JHU), Laurel Maryland.  Direction to APL/JHU are available at www.jhuapl.edu/newscenter/visitor/.  To register please contact Mr. Jeff Beard at email Jeffrey.Beard@Navy.mil or Barbara Hime at email Barbara.Hime@Navy.mil by 20 October 2006.  The Navy will email a registration list to all registered participants on or before 25 October 2006.  The morning briefings will remain at the unclassified level presenting an overview of future CREW programs, the acquisition strategy, as well as, a detailed discussion of the dismounted and mounted Requests For Proposals (RFPs).  The afternoon briefs will provide detailed requirements information and operational information.  These briefs will be!   classified at the secret level and require each participant to submit a security clearance prior to the meeting.   If you plan to participate in the afternoon discussions please fax clearances to 240-228-6400 by 20 October 2006.  The point of contact for clearances is Mr. David Kubik.   The Department of Defense (DoD) is initiating a spiral development effort to counter both the existing threat posed by radio controlled Improvised Electronic Devices (IEDs) in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the long-term worldwide IED threat.  The Naval Sea Systems Command is planning to execute procurements to address these combined threats.  The DoD will first award one or more contract(s) to design, develop, fabricate, and test both man portable (dismounted) and vehicle mounted (mounted) Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare (CREW) systems.  By incorporating technical advances over existing CREW systems, these systems will address both the urgent requirement for dismounted CREW systems in Iraq and Afghanistan and initiate development and demonstration of the next generation dismounted CREW systems.  These next generation dismounted and mounted systems will provide a technological bridge leading to an integrated system of systems.  The final pr!  ocurement will integrate dismounted, mounted and fixed CREW systems into a single system of systems capable of addressing the future worldwide CREW threats.   The Naval Sea Systems Command plans to initiate procurement of the dismounted and mounted systems with a release of a Request for Procurement (RFP) in 1st Quarter of Government Fiscal Year (GFY) 07 followed by contract award early 2nd Quarter GFY 07.  Industry will have approximately a five to seven month development period leading to a one year Government test cycle.  The Government anticipates awarding production contract(s) in 3rd Quarter GFY 08, requiring initial delivery late the same quarter.   Contract award for the integrated system of systems procurement is planned for 4TH Quarter GFY08 with initial delivery planned for 2ND Quarter FY12.  The DoD will provide specific details of these acquisition strategies during the industry day on 27 October 2006.   The DoD has developed detailed program requirements and specifications for each of these procurements.  Basic requirements will include increased portability (smaller/lighter dismounted systems, reduced vehicle impact for mounted systems), reduced power demands, increased frequency coverage, increased modularity, increased interoperability with other CREW systems, and improved compatibility with other DoD systems.  Specific details of these requirements will be presented during the industry day on 27 October 2006.   Tentative Agenda for Industry Day is as follows:            Joint CREW Industry Day Agenda Time		Event			 0800 		Check-in		 0830		Introductory Remarks	 0900		Spiral 3.1 and 3.2                       Requests for Proposal	 		Goal                  Statement of work 		Section L&M 1000		Quick Reaction Dismounted                   QRD Status including continued studies 		Development BAA 1030		System Testing 					 1100		Break 1115 		Open Discussion and Questions			 1200		Lunch 1300		Analysis of Alternatives				 1400		System Specification					Detailed break down of specification                        requirements 1500		Break 1515		Science and Technology Focus			 1545		Break 1600		Open Discussion / Q&A Period			 1645		Wrap-up & Adjourn

<SUBJECT>A -- Research And Development
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) soliciting information from industry on developing or proven technologies supportive of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).  The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard have defined MDA to be the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime environment that could impact the security, safety, economy or environment of the United States.  MDA involves the collection, fusion, and dissemination of enormous quantities of data and information drawn from U.S. joint forces, U.S. government agencies, international coalition partners and forces, and commercial entities.  The depth of information collected from these various sources is weaved together to enrich a comprehensive common operating picture (COP) that is envisioned to be distributed widely among users with access to data that is classified appropriately.  In short, the purpose of MDA is to generate actionable intelligence for exchange within a global enterprise of analysts as well as front-line military and law enforcement professionals.  Without actionable intelligence, counterterrorist or maritime law enforcement operations are seldom fruitful.  The challenge is to integrate and fuse effectively the various inputs to achieve the synergies offered by a comprehensive situational awareness picture, while being responsive to the information needs of participating agencies.
NRL has multiple ongoing MDA programs.  A three-year effort recently selected is referred to as Maritime Automatic Super Track Enhanced Reporting (MASTER).  MASTER objectives include (1) Aggregating data from multiple sources useful in determining ship movement, current location, and intentions, (2) Further automating the generation and maintenance of tracks of ships of all sizes on a global basis, (3) Associating/linking relevant metadata to ship tracks that assist front-line personnel and analysts in determining track history, current behavior, status, and other pertinent information, (4) Generating and attaching notification, alert, and warning metadata to ship tracks that can be used to flag vessels of interest accurately, and (5) Reporting tracks and metadata to front-line military or law enforcement personnel and analysts at different security levels.  The anticipated capability enhancements will be: (1) Greatly improved maritime situational awareness, (2) Automatic maintenance of a large number of ship tracks per day, (3) A service-oriented architecture (SOA).

Specifically, this RFI seeks information on non-proprietary MDA efforts and technology under contract to a United States Government or foreign government agency.  Such efforts completed and demonstrated within the last year are also of interest as well as commercial offerings (e.g., of vessel metadata).  Data sources, successes, and innovations in the following areas are of special interest: (1) Sensor data from governmental systems and shore-based facilities that provide vessel identification or vessel location, (2) Tracker/correlator/fusion  algorithms for different operating areas (open ocean, littorals, straights, and ports), (3) Multi-source vessel metadata, (4) Detection methods and alerting criteria for ship behavior or metadata deviating from historical norms, published plans, or predictions, and (5) Accredited mechanisms to exchange information dynamically between systems and applications at different security levels.

Vendors interested in responding to this RFI may submit information by mail or email in English no later than October 26, 2006.  Information may be submitted to: Naval Research Laboratory, 4555 Overlook, Ave. S.W., ATTN: Mr. Louis Chmura, Code 8145, 4555 Overlook Avenue, Washington, D.C. 20375, or to email address: nrlmda@kingcrab.nrl.navy.mil.  Submissions should include the following information: (a) Name of current or recent contract effort, (b) Government contract number, (c) Government Program Manager contact information, (d) Vendor Point of Contact, and (e) Summary of effort (two-page maximum).  Submissions at higher classification levels can be arranged upon request.  Submission of a response to this RFI is voluntary.  The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate the NRL to pay or entitle the submitter.  NRL may contact selected vendors for subsequent technical discussions.  Responses received after October 26, 2006 will not be reviewed.

<SUBJECT>A -- Follow up to NEOPAIN, Pain, Morphine and the Developing Brain: School Age Outcomes
<DESC>The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to negotiate with Arkansas Children?s Hospital for a three-year noncompetitive contract to conduct a follow up study of the surviving cohort of preterm infants enrolled in the NEOPAIN Grant study 1-R01-HD036484.  

The Government is interested in obtaining status and information about the role of pain and its long-term effects on the overall health, well being, cognition, academic skill, executive functions, self regulation, attention and school status of the children now reaching ages 6 through 8.  As a result, the NICHD does not have legal rights to the identifying data on the original cohort participants.  Therefore, the cohort could not be transferred to any other contractor by the NICHD.  In order to perform the continued work a new prospective contractor would need access to a comparable cohort of mothers and infants, similar in age, that have been subject to a comparable  assessment from infancy.  With the exception of the incumbent (Arkansas Children?s Hospital), there is no domestic source presently known to the NICHD that has access to such a cohort and ownership of the specific patient population (required for this study) via data from the initial NEOPAIN Grant.  

It will cost the government additional time and effort to duplicate the initial NEOPAIN Grant study 1-R01-HD036484.  All of the above factors, taken together, make Arkansas Children?s Hospital uniquely qualified for carrying out this study. 

Authority:  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this final phase of the study, which provides for longer follow-up and data analysis.  

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there are other sources capable of meeting the Government?s requirements as described.  Contractors are encouraged to submit three (3) copies of their written Capability Statements to Ms. Susan Cortes-Shrank, Contract Specialist, at the address provided within 45 days of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received should document access to a comparable cohort of mothers and infants, similar in age, that have been subject to a comparable assessment from infancy. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Overnight deliveries should be mailed to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, MSC 7510 Bethesda, Maryland 20852.    See Numbered Note 22 ****.     No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

Requirements:

1.0 INTRODUCTION

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Finance Center (NFC), is procuring hotel rooms for NFC shutdown team employees in the event that a disaster impacts the New Orleans area.  The NFC Statement of Work will assure consistent performance and be result-orientated.  The selected contractor will provide hotel room accommodations in accordance with all terms and conditions set forth in the contract.  

2.0 BACKGROUND

Although this need applies to all potential disasters, it is anticipated that the primary reason for utilizing hotel rooms will be a hurricane-related.  Hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30.  In the event of the possibility of a hurricane impacting the New Orleans area, selected employees of the NFC will require housing in a safe location that is away from the current hurricane and potential hurricane hazards and dangers.  At least 36 hours prior to landfall of a hurricane, a team will be deployed to this safe location.  If a storm similar to Hurricane Katrina impacts the New Orleans area, it will require that NFC remain in the safe location for an undetermined amount of time, due to the inability to return to normal operations in the New Orleans area.  

3.0 SCOPE

3.1	Period of Performance
The contract period of performance is for one year with four one-year option periods.  The services will be required on an as-needed basis.  The base and option periods are as follows:

Base Year		DATE OF AWARD  through OCTOBER 1, 2007
Option Year 1:		June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2008
Option Year 2:		June 1, 2008 through May 31, 2009
Option Year 3:		June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010	
Option Year 4:		June 1, 2010 through May 31, 2011

3.2 Quantities
The NFC anticipates the need for 16 hotel rooms and 16 parking spaces.  These numbers may increase or decrease slightly depending on NFC?s needs.  

The total contract minimum guarantee is $2,500.  If the NFC does not occupy hotel rooms during the life of the contract, the minimum guarantee of $2,500 will be paid to the contractor.  If, during the life of the contract, the NFC occupies the contractor?s hotel rooms, the amount paid to the contractor for those rooms will be applied toward the $2,500 minimum guarantee.  The contract will remain in place until May 31, 2011, if the Government decides to exercise the option periods.

3.3 Quality Assurance 
The contractor?s proposal should include a quality control plan for ensuring an acceptable level of quality of the hotel rooms and housekeeping services.

4.0 APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS

The contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, local, and municipal laws, regulations, and requirements (including the Hotel and Motel Fire Safety Act of 1990 (PL101-391)), and all industry standards/references as necessary for the services required herein.

5.0 TECHINCAL REQUIREMENTS

In the event of a major hurricane threat, the safe location is considered to be at least 100 miles and no further than 250 miles from the New Orleans area.  The contractor should supply a list of names, addresses, and distances from the hotel of general support services such as hospitals, commercial airport, pharmacies, etc. 
 
Approximately 16 rooms will be needed as soon as it is known that normal operations will be impossible to reestablish in the New Orleans area.  At a minimum, the hotel rooms must have one queen sized bed, telephone, and television.  The contractor shall specify any additional amenities.
