NAICS: 115310 Size Standard: $7.5M, 100% Set-Aside for Total Small Business under the 115310 NAICS code for Support Activities for Forestry. The Government anticipates award of a single firm fixed price contract.    

An organized site visit is NOT scheduled. Offerors or quoters are urged and expected to inspect the site where services are to be performed and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions and density estimates that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable. IN NO EVENT SHALL FAILURE TO INSPECT THE SITE CONSTITUTE GROUNDS FOR A CLAIM AFTER CONTRACT AWARD

IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:
Period of performance is estimated and based on weather, soil conditions and weed phenology. It is expected that the selected contractor(s) will be available following award and can start the project as soon as weather, ground and weed conditions allow. In addition, project site(s) may need to be sprayed at the same time, or within a very short window; therefore, enough personnel/equipment would be required to perform simultaneous and/or large-scale applications. During the application, access roads may not be passable or will require four-wheeled drive vehicles.   

Questions regarding this project must be submitted to Kim Ferguson, via email to k1fergus@blm.gov , no later than 4pm PT on Friday September 14, 2018.

<p>The solicitation will be issued as a Total Small Business Set-Aside that will result in a firm fixed price contract, Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity Type Contract. This is a Best Value acquisition with Source Selection Procedures. The following factors will be utilized in descending order of importance: Production Demonstration Model (PDM) and Past Performance Confidence Assessment.

The Contracting Officer may conduct the technical evaluation using a two-phase process, as contained in the Addendum to provision 52.212-2, Additional Source Selection Evaluation Procedures (applicable to Commercial Item Acquisitions only) or Section M (applicable to other than Commercial Item Acquisitions only). During the first phase of this evaluation process, all offerors' Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) and proposed prices will be evaluated. Those offerors who have submitted PDMs that are most highly rated and who have submitted price proposals that are realistic and competitive with other offerors who have submitted most highly rated PDMs will then be evaluated in the second phase of this evaluation process for the remaining technical evaluation factors.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to modify its current contract number HHSF223201710592A with Nexight Group LLC., 8405 Colesville Road, 4th Floor, Silver Spring, MD 20910, for Standards Development for Regenerative Medicine Therapies to add a two-day workshop on the development and use of reference materials/physical standards and documentary standards, publish fact sheets on standards development processes as an output of the 2-day workshop and publish summaries of standards relevant to regenerative medicine advanced therapies under development to create awareness and recruit experts to work on these standards. Nexight has already established an organization consisting of FDA, NIST, and stakeholders, coordinated the development and implementation of the processes and identified and prioritize standards that have a high impact on the quality and safety of regenerative medicine products through webinars and written reports. It is imperative that consistent processes from the previous data are followed to ensure the objective of this requirement is met. Having to recreate what Nexight has already commenced would add additional cost to the government.<br /><br />The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<br /><br />The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990-All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services with a small business size standard of $15 million. <br /><br />This is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any interested party that believes it can meet the requirement stated above may submit a written capability statement that clearly supports and demonstrates their ability to perform the requirement. Capability statements must be submitted to Regina Williams at regina.williams@fda.hhs.gov by 12:00 pm Central Standard Time, on or before September 14, 2018. A determination not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. If no responsive statements are received before the closing date and time, an award will subsequently be made to Nexight Group LLC.

<SOLNBR>NASA-GSFC-PHASE-E-EXTENSION-NNG09EK06C-UCLA
<RESPDATE>092518
<CONTACT>Naimah K.  Bhuruku, Contracting Officer, Phone 3012865029, Email naimah.bhuruku@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for the continuation of Contract NNG09EK06C with the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) for the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (DLRE) Investigation on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Mission. UCLA is currently performing both the instrument operations management, which includes instrument operations planning, scheduling, and engineering parameter review and trending, as well as the science operations which includes planning all instrument modes, table loads, calibrations and data dissemination to the co-investigators and to the general scientific community through the Planetary Data System (PDS).
<p>NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to UCLA. The estimated period of performance of this cost-no-fee (CNF) contract extension will be for one (1) year from March 16, 2019 through March 15, 2020.</p>
<p>The UCLA, in conjunction with their partner at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), is the only organization currently qualified to perform the subject requirement for the following reasons: 1) Only UCLA possesses the high level scientific expertise, the detailed knowledge of the Diviner instrument and LRO spacecraft, and the capability to carry out the targeting and operations in a manner in which the scientific operations and the flight operations can be merged. 2) Current Diviner team members are unique in their familiarity with the Diviner instrument design, testing and calibration as well as the LRO spacecraft. From 2005-2009, UCLA and JPL designed, fabricated, calibrated, tested, and integrated the Diviner instrument with the LRO spacecraft, including testing at the Spacecraft level after delivery to LRO. Under contract NNG09EK06C, UCLA has successfully carried out the science operations and science analysis of the Diviner instrument on the LRO spacecraft since LRO launch in June 2009. Dr. David Paige of UCLA, is a leading expert in his field of planetary geophysics, was selected by NASA Headquarters to lead this investigation, based on an evaluation of his proposal submitted under the Announcement of Opportunity for exploration measurements in NASA's LRO Mission (AO NNH04ZSS003O). The Diviner instrument is a state-of-the-art, one-of-a-kind instrument. UCLA developed unique software and processes for: (a) testing the instruments on-orbit, (b) creating the operational table loads, (c) processing the raw data so that scientists can manipulate, display, and analyze the scientific data received, and (d) producing summary data. This effort requires the detailed understanding of the instrument and all related software. Since no other organization was involved with these activities on an in-depth level, no other organization currently has the knowledge and experience to perform the requirement.</p>
<p>Statutory authority for this procurement is 10 U.S.C. 304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source. However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on&nbsp;September 20, 2018. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation. A solicitation document will not be issued and quotations will not be requested.
<p>The Functional &amp; Applied Biomechanics Section (FAB) of the Rehabilitation Medicine Department, Clinical Center, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) currently utilizes a ten-camera passive optical motion capture system from Vicon Motion Systems, Inc. that was purchased in 2009. The motion capture system is central to all of FAB's internal and most of our support research protocols, and is the primary reason other institutes and departments refer clinical patients to our lab. The motion capture system is integrated with other hardware and software such as force plates, treadmill, EMG, virtual reality, and custom software for real-time control and feedback. This system has been approved for CERC replacement.</p>
<p>The motion capture system is the most important research tool utilized by FAB. The current system is nearing ten years of life. There have been some small issues with the current system, and we hope to replace the system now before bigger problems arise. All but one of our internal protocols requires the motion capture system, so downtime would cause significant problems. Technology has also improved over the past ten years so the newer systems should be more accurate, faster processing, and help the staff to be more efficient and productive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Period of Performance for maintenance is a One (1) Base Year Period and Four (4) Option Year Periods.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

This new equipment will expand the CHI capabilities in immunophenotyping. Reducing manual labor to increase staff productivity and quality work. The automated cell staining system design was based on the manual protocol currently used at the CHI. The protocol requires transfer of washed cells from 96 conical tubes into a deep well plate, splitting sample between 4 plates. Following steps include temperature-controlled shaking, incubations in the dark and centrifugations. Having all these steps automated is crucial as user interference can introduce errors, like switching tubes or sample plates. The Fluent 780 platform has incredible deck capacity that allows to accommodate custom rack for ninety-six 15-mL conical tubes, few microplate thermal shakers and multiple plate positions. Incubations in the dark can be done in drawers under the deck. Centrifuge, integrated with the Fluent 780 system, can also be used for incubations, followed by centrifugations. Located on the floor under the deck, centrifuge can be loaded and unloaded by extended robotic gripper arm. All these features allow to configure the instrument for fully automated process. Fluent 780 perform multiple tasks simultaneously with fast, independent, task-specific arms that work in parallel. Tecan's patented Path Finder technology automatically calculates the optimal route for each arm, every time, ensuring that runs are completed quickly and efficiently. In addition to that, Fluent 780 has an integrated barcode scanner for sample tracking. The vendor Tecan U.S. does not have any resellers or distributors in the United States and Tecan U.S. is the only source for the Fluent 780 Cell Staining Workstation.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source requirement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 only one source available, no substitutions possible.

During the execution of the SDD contract, the Prime Contractor performed a trade study and determined that Aechelon Technology provided the best solution for simulating the P-8A Natural Environment and the P-8A Database.
 After the initial selection under the SDD contract, all of the Prime Contractors efforts related to IG and P-8A Databases were completed on a sole source basis to Aechelon.  Market research continues to reveal that Aechelon Technology is the only known source that possesses the required technical expertise and knowledge to complete the IG and Database work procured on the following P-8A training system contracts as a Subcontractor.  The follow-on to the initial SDD selection of Aechelon as a Subcontractor was the LRIP I-III contract N00019-09-C-0022, LRIP IV-FRP I contract N00019-12-C-0112, and the current FRP II contract N00019-14-C-0067.  NAWCTSD is currently seeking to award a Firm Fixed Price contract, directly to Aechelon, on a sole source basis to meet the current fleet deficiency with a dramatically reduced schedule.
Currently, a lack of operationally relevant entities and operational areas is negatively impacting current fleet readiness, successful mission accomplishment, and the fleets ability to use its existing capabilities safely.
 The P-8A database is integral to P-8A training and is required to be upgraded to train for operations against new threats and flight operations from airfields and areas of interest that were not previously delivered or have changed since initial delivery in 2011 and subsequent update in 2014 for the world wide database.  The RAAF-specific P-8A database was then delivered in April 2018 and also requires upgrades.

The P-8A database was developed based on specific P-8A operating areas where aircrews perform simulated missions in operationally realistic areas of the world.  These operating areas were developed for specific Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) and Out-the-Window simulations based on Aechelon-proprietary technology for real-time paging and integrated with the P-8A Host Computational System and NGTS.
 Aechelon runtime format is the only format that will run on P-8A training systems.  Any source other than Aechelon, would result in re-architecture of the P-8A training systems consisting of replacement of the entire suite of IG hardware, re-integration with the P-8A training baseline, and re-procurement of existing database development work.  This would result in the need to replace $35.3M in hardware, perform $3M in non-recurring RADAR database paging development, and re-development of over $32M in existing P-8A databases based on the costs derived from recent procurements with RAAF production training devices, Production Concurrency Upgrade (PCU) 15 and PCU 17 efforts with P-8A.
The P-8A database is extensively utilized on the suite of P-8A Training System devices including:  17 Weapons Tactics Trainers (WTT), 20 Operational Flight Trainers (OFT), 15 Part Task Trainers (PTT), and 8 Deployable Mission Rehearsal Trainers (DMRT).
 These devices utilize Aechelons proprietary data and hardware consisting of:  140 Aechelon IG, 4 Aechelon Unified Storage Systems (USS), and 143 Aechelon RADAR Data Generators (RDG).  These upgraded Aechelon-based training system devices will simulate current up-to-date natural and tactical environments for the warfighter to train on in a simulated environment.
Due to Aechelons intellectual property and data rights, a sole source procurement is necessary and imperative to develop and integrate new and modified P-8A databases with Aechelon.  Aechelon does not sell its intellectual property and data rights, but rather provides licenses or data rights under applicable Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement requirements, as required for the use of its technical data, software, and visual databases.
 Also, Aechelon does not provide manufacturing rights to its IG and other system products.  In order to make the training devices concurrent with the aircraft, in the required timeframe, contracting with Aechelon, on a sole source basis, is necessary.
This pre-solicitation notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  It is a notice that outlines the Governments intent to award a contract on a sole-source basis with Aechelon.  However, interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, ability to obtain P-8A aircrew and maintenance elements and simulation technical data, and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government.
 Detailed capabilities must be submitted by email to Mr. Vance Rosebush at vance.rosebush@navy.mil in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2003, no later than close of business on 26 September 2018.  Small businesses can inquire with Aechelon at (415) 255-0120 or sales@aechelon.com for possible subcontracting opportunities.  Small businesses interested in subcontracting/supplier opportunities are also encouraged to notify the Government POC identified below as well as the NAWCTSD Small Business Deputy at leslie.faircloth@navy.mil.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Responses shall be limited to no more than TEN (10) pages.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.
 Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This pre-solicitation notice is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  No solicitation document is available.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government.  If no affirmative written response is received, a sole source contract will be awarded to Aechelon for the procurement of modifications to the existing Aechelon-to-NGTS P-8A Simulation Interface, new databases consisting of airfields and 3D models, and modify existing databases for the USN and the RAAF P-8A Training Systems.
This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under statutory authority of 10 U.S.C.
2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).  Matters pertaining to this notification may be directed to Vance Rosebush at (407) 380-4867 or via email at vance.rosebush@navy.mil.

Price 

The Phase I evaluation will result in a determination of the most highly qualified Offerors.  These Offerors will be requested to submit a Phase II proposal.  A maximum of five (5) Offerors will be selected to submit a Phase II proposal unless the Contracting Officer determines that a number greater than five is in the Governments interest and is consistent with the purposes and objectives of two-phase DB contracting.
 

THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The RFP will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fbo.gov, and the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) https://www.neco.navy.mil/ on or about April 7, 2017.

Results of Sources Sought
A market survey was completed by posting a Sources Sought under solicitation N4425517MKTG3 on FBO and NECO on November 23, 2016 with a due date of December 7, 2016.   The sources sought requested responses from interested prime contractors and statements of capabilities.   The Government received a total of one response from a small business.  An analysis was made of the response, and the single respondent could not be considered qualified based on the submission.   The sources sought analysis was provided to the SBA with the DD 2579 documentation.  Additionally the Government performed various searches on the dynamic small business search website to identify potential capable small business.
  As a result of the market research, the contracting officer has determined there is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or more responsible small business concerns in accordance with FAR 19.502-2.  The Activity Small Business Office concurs with this decision.

<div>Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane intends to solicit and negotiate a Five-Year, Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ), Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract for the manufacture of AN/SPG-62 Antenna Reflectors (P/N 6778045-50) with General Dynamics Mission Systems, Inc. 150 Johnston Rd, Marion, VA  24354-4324. The Government is contracting without providing for full and open competition under the authority of FAR 6.302-1; General Dynamics Mission Systems, Inc. is the only source capable of manufacturing the highly specialized AN/SPG-62 Antenna Reflector and award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through competition, and would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. <br /><br /></div>
<div>The Government estimates that the IDIQ minimum will be a quantity of 09 (Each) AN/SPG-62 Antenna Reflectors. The Government estimates that the IDIQ maximum is potentially a quantity of 45 (Each) AN/SPG-62 Antenna Reflectors over the course of the Five Year Contract. Delivery Terms will be F.o.b.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), located in Cambridge, MA, intends to issue a solicitation for basic research services to perform a highly thoughtful and foundational examination and synthesis of automotive software development history and practices. The Volpe Center seeks expert knowledge and extensive experience of a Contractor who is very familiar with all aspects of the lifecycle development, production, and maintenance of automotive control system software. The Contractor shall also be very familiar with general software practices in other domains that implement complex, software-intensive control systems. These systems are characterized by advanced, heterogeneous sensors to enable autonomous control capability, and in which connectivity through internal and external networks is leveraged by the software to enhance system performance. The Contractor will produce an original high-quality seminal volume with visionary insight and perspective from career experience, and from a rigorous review of literature and outreach to key academic, industry, and government sources. This seminal volume will be a highly thoughtful examination and study that reflects the Contractor's deep integration of knowledge spanning the automotive control system software build, test and validation activities associated with the lifecycle development, production, and maintenance of automotive software-rather than a recitation of introductory computer science and software engineering concepts.
<p><br />The solicitation will be issued using full and open competitive procedures. In order to meet the Government's needs the contractor must meet the following requirements: <br />1) Have at least 20 years' experience with automotive software.<br />2) Have experience with both prototype and production software.<br />3) Have knowledge of ISO 26262.<br />4) Have supported at least 4 automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers in previous work.</p>

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. It is estimated the solicitation will be issued in 15 - 20 calendar days. A complete Statement of Work will be&nbsp;issued with the solicitation. Proposals will be due about 30 calendar days after the release date of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Interested firms who believe this solicitation should be set-aside for small business must submit a written capability statement to the above named point of contact providing clear and convincing evidence of the firms' capability to provide the required services. Written capability statements must be submitted within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Responses received after fifteen (15) calendar days or without the required documentation will be considered non-responsive and will not be considered. Such documentation will be utilized solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to set this solicitation aside for small business. The Government will not pay for any documentation provided in response to this synopsis and documentation received will not be returned to the sender. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a small business set-aside, based upon responses received to the synopsis, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>NOTE: The Volpe Center uses electronic commerce to issue requests for proposals and amendments. Paper copies will not be made available. The solicitation and any related documents will be issued on the Government Point of Entry knows as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) All contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), located at www.sam.gov, in order to receive an award from a DOT Agency.</p>
<p>Be advised this project may be delayed, cancelled, or revised at any time during the pre-solicitation, solicitation, evaluation, selection, negotiation, and/or final award process.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<p>This is a notice of the Government's intent to solicit, negotiate and award to National Academy of Sciences under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), intends to award a sole source Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) to National Academy of Sciences - Engineering - Medicine, 500 Fifth Street, North West KECK 1051, Washington, DC 20001, to provide all personnel and services necessary to support the following Statement of Objectives and Questions that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Statement of Objectives<br />In the regulation of pharmaceutical products, some National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) are increasingly using mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) to leverage their regulatory resources and remit. The range and approach of these MRAs varies widely: some NRAs may recognize and rely upon other regulatory authorities in the conduct of inspections (GMP inspections), and/or in drugs/medicinal products entering the marketplace that are manufactured in one country and imported in the other country, including active pharmaceutical ingredients and veterinary pharmaceuticals. Some NRAs may use MRAs as one of several factors when determining when to "rely" upon another NRAs regulatory actions or findings. <br />QUESTIONS TO ADDRESS: What is the current global landscape of these types of Mutual Recognition Agreements? And more importantly when MRAs are implemented, what are the public health impacts, resource savings and/or resource redirection, e.g., to areas of higher risks? And over time, what if any are the impacts to an NRA's technical, scientific and regulatory competencies? <br />This announcement is published for informational purpose only. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS OR QUOTATIONS. Request for copies of a solicitation in response to this notice will not be honored or acknowledged.</p>
<p>The anticipated award date is approximately September 30, 2018. Please note that this is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the product/services listed above. Deadline date for the submittals is The response date for the submittals is 9/26/2018 at 12 noon EST.</p>
<p>A determination by the government not to compete this requirement, based on responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>
<p>The closing date for this notice is 9/26/2018 at 12 noon EST. Inquiries should be emailed to the Contracting Specialist at the following address:</p>

<DESC>The New York District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) intends to issue a 1 Step Best Value - Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Request for Proposal (RFP) for the construction of Post-Wide Exterior LED Lighting at Fort Drum, NY.
<p>The work includes installing approximately 3,077 new light emitting diode exterior lighting (with motion sensor controls) and remove existing twenty-year old high pressure sodium (HPS) vapor parking lot, street, and building light fixtures. The LED fixtures will reduce the electricity by up to 80%, reduce maintenance costs, and improve light quality. Existing HPS lighting is 20+ years old. The yellow light from the HPS is of very poor quality. Relamping is required every 5 years. Energy is being wasted while poor quality of light is continued to be provided. The LED lighting provides for a better quality white light then HPS. The LED light is rated for 100,000 hours of life or five times the lamp life of HPS. The fixtures will last 22 years before requiring replacement. <br />The solicitation will be a 1 step best value trade-off solicitation. The proposed evaluation factors include: Past Experience, Past Performance and Price.</p>
<p>This procurement is being solicited as Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set Aside. The contract will be awarded using the Best Value - Lowest Price Technically Acceptable evaluation method. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238210. The magnitude of construction for this project is $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00.<br />The media selected for issuance of Synopsis/Solicitation and amendments shall solely be at the discretion of the Government; accordingly, the media utilized for this project shall be the internet. Paper copies of this solicitation and amendments, if any, will not be available or issued. In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7007, all vendors who want access to the solicitation must be registered with System for Award Management (SAM), located at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ and Federal Business Opportunity (FedBizOpps), located at http://www.fbo.gov, in order to safeguard acquisition-related information for all Federal Agencies.

Market research was conducted to search for a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based COTS Space Management software that will provide geo-locational information supporting asset management, work order tracking, move management, and scheduling and are capable of interfacing with ArcGIS for Server and Portal for ArcGIS v10.4.1 and leveraged in support of the IG&amp;S program, better known as GEOFidelis. The solution would need to be an application-level space management solution that leverage GIS based technology approaches to infrastructure management both outside and inside the buildings with the ability to join geospatial data to other tabular databases such as IBM Maximo (USMCMax) and the internet Navy Facility Asset Data Store (iNFADS); would need to support aggregation, analysis, and query at installation, regional, and global scales and are compatible with the existing GEOFidelis Online system architecture; and would need to leverage ESRI's ArcGIS for Server and Portal for ArcGIS to provide space management solutions that meet MCICOM's requirement for centralized data management, mass multiple simultaneous editors, spatial-temporal analysis, collaboration and markup, scenario planning, enterprise database integration from other authoritative data stores, reporting and analysis tools, web publishing, integration with other databases, supports raster data integration, provides CAD to GIS conversion tools, provides BIM/Revit data interoperability, and supports Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle Spatial Relational Databases. Out of the solutions currently available on the commercial market that meets these criteria found through market research, InVision software meets all of the compatibility requirements and could be installed and configured with the existing GEOFidelis Online System architecture at a fair and reasonable price. The only other solution found that meets all of the technical criteria and compatibility requirements would cost approximately 7.5 times the price of the InVision product. PenBay Solutions are the sole source providers of InVision Software, retaining exclusive rights for software sales and maintenance making the software only available from them.</p>

<DESC><strong>Description:</strong>
<p><strong>Synopsis:&nbsp; <br /></strong>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p><strong>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding:</strong> <br />(1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; <br />(2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and <br />(3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Background:&nbsp; <br /></strong>AHRQ established two patient safety resources - (1) Patient Safety Network (PSNet) and (2) Web Morbidity and Mortality (WebM&amp;M) - in 2004. In 2015 AHRQ combined PSNet and WebM&amp;M into one website to streamline the user's experience; the website is now called PSNet. PSNet is a national, web-based resource featuring carefully selected, annotated resources on patient safety for multiple audiences, including health care providers, policymakers, patients, and educators. The current PSNet offers weekly updates of patient safety literature, news, tools, and meetings and a vast set of carefully annotated links to important research and other information on patient safety. PSNet provides powerful searching and browsing capability, as well as the ability for diverse users to customize the resource to their interests, and is supported by a robust patient safety taxonomy and web architecture.</p>
<p>PSNet includes WebM&amp;M, which is a national, web-based learning program for health care providers. WebM&amp;M relies on user-submitted reports of near misses, medical errors, and patient harm/injury associated with or that are the direct result of health care delivery. WebM&amp;M content includes user-submitted cases of medical errors, expert commentaries, and perspectives on patient safety.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives:<br /></strong>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is looking for firms which have the capability to: (1) Serve as a coordinating agent and national link to relevant domestic and international, public and private sector, patient safety resources and information; <br />(2) Maintain, monitor, and enhance a national, Web-based learning program for health care providers that relies on reports of near misses, medical errors, and patient harm/injury associated with or the direct result of health care delivery; <br />(3) Advance learning about patient safety by providing downloadable slide sets based on a monthly WebM&amp;M case and offering CME/CEU credits, etc., as appropriate for selected categories of professionals and trainees; <br />(4) Develop and maintain appropriate partnerships to enhance and expand content availability.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Project Requirements:<br /></strong><strong><br />Task 1: Develop Web Platform that Houses PSNET and WEB M&amp;M</strong><br />The contractor shall develop a new website to host PSNet that meets the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) memorandum M-16-21 "Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software". The website must also be hosted at an AHRQ facility or by a Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) compliant cloud service provider (CSP) and shall adhere to the requirements of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014.</p>
<p>The website shall have the same functionality as the current website (https://psnet.ahrq.gov/) to the extent possible given the new Federal and HHS source Code policies. For example, the website shall organize the content by major categories such as Primers, Perspectives, Web M&amp;M, etc. The website shall have a search function so that users can search on any topic to find relevant content and all content shall be tagged with key words to facilitate easy searching. Individuals accessing the website shall be able to customize the content that shows up on the website given their preferences for certain topics. Individuals accessing content that provides continuing education credits (CE) shall be able to register to get the CE and be able to track CE credits earned.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once the contract is awarded, the contractor will receive any available source code and/or data files that were developed on behalf of AHRQ along with any installation or maintenance instructions (including an inventory of objects and modules that constitute the PSNet website). The contractor shall use this information to populate the new PSNet website.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2: Provide Patient Safety Content</strong><br />This task and subtasks requires the contractor to provide a library of carefully selected and annotated links to patient safety literature, news and other resources on PSNet (PSNet Collection, PSNet Classics Selection and PSNet Weekly Updates). The contractor shall also produce: Patient Safety Primers that define a key concept in patient safety, offer background on its epidemiology and context, and highlight relevant content from PSNet and WebM&amp;M; Perspectives on Safety, which feature an interview and written essay on a specific patient safety issue of current interest; and Annual Perspectives which highlight recent research in emerging areas or that address the most significant patient safety news that occurred, resources that became available, and emerging areas of interest in the previous calendar year. Contractor shall provide content for WebM&amp;M including expert analysis of medical errors reported anonymously by readers/users, interactive learning modules on patient safety, and perspective pieces. The Contractor shall obtain and maintain the necessary accreditation status in order to be able to provide continuing medical education (CME) and continuing education units (CEU) on WebM&amp;M Spotlight Cases and Commentary.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3: Maintenance and Enhancement of PSNet</strong> <br />The Contractor shall provide system operation and maintenance for PSNet in accordance with all the Federal and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) requirements in laws, policies, and directives. The Contractor shall ensure that PSNet conform to AHRQ's Publishing and Communications Guidelines and that all activities are integrated with AHRQ enterprise systems. Maintenance of the system shall include system monitoring, security and privacy controls and monitoring, quality control (including content review), and configuration/change management protocols. Enhancements are an optional task where the Government may require prioritized changes and/or enhancements that are to be made to PSNet.</p>
<p><strong>Task 4: Promotion of PSNet <br /></strong>The Contractor shall work to increase the uptake and usage of PSNet by developing, implementing, and maintaining a formal plan to promote the availability and utility of PSNet to relevant audiences. The Contractor shall develop a Promotion Plan related to the objectives, benefits, and content of PSNet and on the options for promoting the availability and utility of both resources.</p>
<p><strong>Task 5: Assessment of PSNet</strong> <br />The Contractor shall conduct annual user satisfaction surveys and use the survey data to enhance PSNet. Individual, annual customer satisfaction surveys must be completed before the end of the contract base year and each option year. The Contractor shall be responsible for creating all OMB submission packages necessary for the task, hosting the Web-based user satisfaction surveys, analyzing the data, and preparing and submitting draft and final reports to the COR, and identifying relevant changes/recommendations for improvement derived from the satisfaction surveys.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance:<br /></strong>The period of performance will be a [1] one year base period (March 30, 2019 - March 29, 2020), with [4] four, [1] one-year option periods.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Capability Statement / Information Sought:<br /></strong>Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability statement to address the following:</p>

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command, APG, Natick Contracting Division intends to award a firm fixed price contract under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) to Workflow Interiors of 132 Canal Street #2, Boston, MA 02114. Natick Contracting Division (NCD) was directed to move personnel into Bldg. 32 as soon as possible. In order to comply with the directive, NCD is using a combination of current cubicles and furniture, as well as, supplementing with the purchase of new parts and cubicles. In order to maximize the amount of cubicles we can accommodate in Bldg. 32, the original furniture company who outfitted the office was called in to do an assessment of how to best re-use the furniture they installed in the new building and what parts we would need to purchase in order to reuse the cubicles. The company has the CAD files of the original furniture and therefore, were the only contractor that could quickly turn around the project for NCD. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

STATEMENT OF WORK FOR 
ELECTROSURGICAL GENERATOR 
WITH ARGON BEAM COAGULATION


Introduction and Background

The VA New York Harbor Healthcare System is dedicated to providing quality health care to veterans using the abilities of all employees supported by our commitment to education and research.

We are recognized locally, regionally, and nationally as a leader in quality patient care, positive customer service, medical/allied health education, health-related research and employment opportunities. We seek to be the provider of choice of veterans and the community by offering an efficient, integrated quality health care system capable of providing a full range of primary, specialty and chronic health care services in a system that is readily accessible and responsive to change.

The Surgical Service at New York Harbor Healthcare System provides surgical services for the benefit of veterans that improves their health and well-being with trust, respect, commitment, compassion and excellence through practice, innovative research and unprecedented education. The service offer a full range of outpatient and inpatient elective surgical services, including: specialty clinics in the fields of General Surgery, Plastic Surgery, Cardiothoracic Surgery, and Vascular Surgery. The Surgeons at the VA provide thoughtful consultation to our referring colleagues and state-of-the-art surgical care to our patients. 

Electrosurgery

Electrosurgery is the application of a high-frequency (radio frequency) alternating polarity, electrical current to biological tissue as a means to cut, coagulate, desiccate, or fulgurate tissue. (These terms are used in specific ways for this methodology see below). Its benefits include the ability to make precise cuts with limited blood loss. Electrosurgical devices are frequently used during surgical operations helping to prevent blood loss in hospital operating rooms or in outpatient procedures. In electrosurgical procedures, the tissue is heated by an electric current. Although electrical devices that create a heated probe may be used for the cauterization of tissue in some applications, electrosurgery is refers to a different method than electrocautery. Electrocautery uses heat conduction from a probe heated to a high temperature by a direct electrical current (much in the manner of a soldering iron). This may be accomplished by direct current from dry-cells in a penlight-type device.

Electrosurgery is a term used to describe multiple modalities that use electricity to cause thermal destruction of tissue through dehydration, coagulation, or vaporization. The two types of electrosurgery most commonly used are high-frequency electrosurgery and electrocautery.

Objective

The VA NYHHS PM&R Service is seeking sources to provide a Electrosurgical Generator with Argon Beam Coagulation. The addition of argon gas enables more precise delivery of RF energy to tissue compared to the traditional spray coagulation. Argon gas helps clear pooled blood and can reduce surgeon effort. It also displaces oxygen from the immediate surgical field reducing the carbonization of tissue, blood loss and smoke plume thereby providing adequate visualization of the surgical site. 

The vendor shall be able to provide a brand name HelixAR Electrosurgical Generator with Argon Beam Coagulation from CONMED

STATEMENT OF WORK

BACKGROUND
The James J. Peters Veteran Affairs Medical Center currently has a Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) program that has long-term care patients with limited functionality that do not have the capability to control their surroundings.  The Environmental Control Units (ECU s) provide increased quality of patient care as well a patient safety.  The ECU s allow patients with limited functionality to control their environment and participate in a broad range of activities.  The ECU s have the capabilities to allow patients to control their environment from a tablet device.
In 2014, ECU s were installed in the JJP VAMC in all SCI patient rooms as part of a national contract with Accessibility Services Inc.  Since 2014, the units have become outdated and there are additional features that will provide greater usability for the end users, our Veterans.  For instance, the tablet screens are now larger, the sip and puff technology and eye gaze technology is improved, and the cord that reaches from the wall unit to the bed is longer.  There is an identified need to upgrade the Environmental Control Units (ECUs) throughout the entire SCI program at the JJP VAMC to successfully and effectively provide consistent quality care.
SCOPE:
The Environmental Control Unit is a system that includes a core unit (wall box with a computer, power supply, accessory connections), articulating arm with mounted TV and mounted touchscreen/eye gazed controlled tablet for command functions, wall connection to the patient use a sip and puff or other devices, interface to the nurse call system, and cables.  The upgrade is to replace the wall box components with smaller, more up-to-date components, to replace the tablet with a larger more up-to-date version, to replace the TV, and to replace the wall connections to a single breakaway connection to the bed.
The Contractor shall upgrade 48 ECU s that were taken down during the renovation of the SCI wards in the 1E and 1D wing of the JJP VAMC and reinstall them based on the new bedroom layout.  The upgrade shall include providing 48 new Care Assist AutonoME junction boxes, 48 new wall boxes for AutonoMe Hospital, and 48 new 13 inch or larger tablets with medical specifications communication aid with rugged body integrated amplification, switch, and other USB access, auditory feedback, Servus Environmental Control   Grid 3 software.  The new equipment must be brand name or equal to Accessibility Services Inc. technology for compatibility purposes and upgrade procedures because the existing ECUs are from Accessibility Services Inc.
Each new junction boxes include a custom bed controller Printed Circuit Board (PCB) board, available barb connector for sip and puff input, 3.5mm female port for switch input, embedded pressure switch, a DB25 male termination for bed control, nurse call, switch, 3.5mm Speaker connection for compatible systems, bed connector for specific bed make and model, and 8.5X4.5X2.5 inches- Surface mounted Break away connection.  The new junction boxes are to be surface mounted to the wall behind each patient bed to allow a single break-away connection to the bed through a custom cable (included).
Each new wall boxes include a 17 X17 x4  surface mounted aluminum case, 12 Channel Infrared (IR) relay board, Printed Circuit Board (PCB) phone board, pig tail audio splitter, USB (Universal Serial Bus) data coupler, female DB25 connection, front facing USB coupler, XLR (an electrical connector commonly used in audio equipment) power adapter- female, 2 female 3.5mm plugs, nurse call 1/4" connection- female, nurse call integration and access, ribbon cable for phone number pad, 3.5mm IR emitter female bulkhead connection, 4 power outlet Power Strip, 5 channel USB hub, custom tablet power supply, IR out 3.5mm female connection
microphone 3.5mm female connection, 2 sound cards with audio in and out ports,
USB pressure switch, IR Transceiver with available 3.5mm female jack that is capable of learning new IR devices via direct programming window, and cable management to include cable covering.  These wall boxes are to replace the older, larger wall boxes and are to be surfaced-mounted to the wall behind and above each patient bed.
The new tablets will replace the existing smaller and older arm-mounted tablets.  Each new tablet will include Windows 10 operating system and the newly updated custom patient interface software called Grid 3.
The ECU s will use the existing electrical receptacles and data ports on the wall in proximity of the wall box mounting location to power on and connect to the hospital network.
Once upgraded, the ECU s will have the salient characteristics listed in the following section.
ECU Salient Characteristics
The ECUs and installation hardware shall have the salient characteristics identified.

<p>This notice is to advise all potential <strong>Small Business Contractors</strong> that GSA has received a request for a performance-based services task order for contractor support for updating the public health assessment manual and completing work on Exposure Point Concentration (EPC) Guidance. for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> The main purpose of this project is to assist the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) in updating and enhancing the 2005 PHAGM and completing the updated EPC guidance.</p>
<p>For the PHAGM update, there are 3 requirements of the task 1) conduct survey using ATSDR provided information of ATSDR scientific and state cooperative staff and provide complete summary of findings so as to provide input into the best design and the suggested content of the manual. 2) assist in choosing a web based platform that can be easily updated in the future as new materials and guidance become available and 3) and produce the new manual with the updated and new materials.  Editing the existing guidance to ensure the entirety is written similar in style across all sections.  Updating the manual will ensure that scientists have the most updated guidance and information for conduct of the health assessment process.</p>
<p>For the EPC update, the objective is to complete the updated guidance (beyond what is provided in the PHAGM) for a major part of the public health assessment process and to provide guidance to inform future updates to the Public Health Assessment Site Tool (PHAST). These guidance documents will help to ensure more consistent approaches for both ATSDR, as well as, state cooperative agreement program products.  Training sessions and material developed for these guidance documents will provide current and future health assessors with scientifically valid and consistent approaches to deal with this important aspect of our public health assessment process.</p>
<p><strong>Description of Services:</strong> The scientific assistance provided by the Contractor will enhance the quality of the science utilized in the public health assessment process relevant to evaluating exposures from hazardous waste or other sites (e.g., National Priorities List aka Superfund, petitioned, facilities, or other sites, public health consultation, exposure investigation, community involvement and health education and promotion activities, and/or other Agency actions). The contractor will support ATSDR's public health responsibilities and shall provide expert consultation on design and preparation of the PHAGM.</p>
<p>For the EPC update portion of this project, the Contractor shall:<br />&bull;	Assist ATSDR staff in completing EPC guidance documents<br />&bull;	Determine scientifically defensible approaches for estimating a reasonable EPC for PAH results obtained from a discrete sampling design and develop guidance.<br />&bull;	Provide training material and conduct recorded training webinars for use by current and future internal and external staff who work on or review ATSDR public health assessments.<br />&bull;	Provide final guidance and training materials that will assist a smooth transition of EPC concepts and approaches into future updates to PHAST.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA/OAR/ARL/ATDD, plans to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, with Mr. Francis Parks to provide site support and maintenance for the Smith Island NADP/NTN Site MD 15.  Period of performance:  Requirement is for a base year, plus four option years based on availability of funding as noted below.
<p>Base Year:			September 14, 2018  -  September 13, 2019<br />Option Year 1:  		September 14, 2019  -  September 13, 2020<br />Option Year 2:		September 14, 2020  -  September 13, 2021<br />Option Year 3:		September 14, 2021  -  September 13, 2022<br />Option Year 4:		September 14, 2022  -  September 13, 2023</p>
<p>The Smith Island, Maryland site (lat 37.9925, -lon 76.0345) is one of approximately 250 stations in the National Atmospheric Deposition Program National Trends Network (NADP/NTN), a joint venture between NOAA, EPA, USDA, USGS, and several other state, federal and private organizations designed to determine trends in the nation's precipitation chemistry.  The Smith Island station was chosen to monitor nitrogen and sulfur deposition directly to the central Chesapeake Bay.  Smith Island is one of the very few places where this is possible, and the selection of a site operator was quite difficult given the location of the station and the very few people who still live there.  The Smith Island site meets NADP siting guidelines and has operated satisfactorily since it began operation in 1995.  Current costs are modest; moving the site or changing the site operator will disrupt a working arrangement that was quite difficult to establish - and selected using a competitive process.  More importantly, moving the site will destroy continuity of our data record, the most important consideration in a trend determination process.</p>
<p>Tasks to be performed.</p>
<p>The work to be performed by Mr. Francis Parks Jr. at the Smith island station as part of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network will be to continue monitoring precipitation chemistry on a weekly basis according to the methods specified by the NADP/NTN Central Analytical Laboratory in Madison, WI.  The effort requires the following:</p>
<p>-	Routine (at least weekly) maintenance of Aerochem Metrics precipitation collector and official recording gauge.</p>
<p>-	Collection of all precipitation samples on a weekly basis for the entire year. Follow the weekly Tuesday to Tuesday sample collection schedule and submit samples with a completed Field Observer Report Form (FORF) and rain gauge chart to the Central Analytical Laboratory (CAL) for analysis.</p>
<p>-	Packaging and shipping of samples to the NADP Central Analytical Laboratory according to NADP/NTN protocols at least once per week.</p>
<p>-	Site and equipment maintenance as necessary.</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>The operator shall submit all required documentation and site operations forms, sample collection forms, etc., to NADP/NTN and shall maintain an electronic log for maintenance, calibrations, etc.  The full requirements for site operation are specified in the <br />the National Trends Network Site Operations Manual<br />http://nadp.slh.wisc.edu/lib/manuals/NTN_Operations_Manual_v_2-3.pdf<br />Support is to be performed on Tuesdays to stay within NADP operating protocols for NTN sample collection.</p>
<p>&middot;        SAMPLES are to be sent to:<br />NADP Central Analytical Lab<br />WI State Laboratory of Hygiene - Sample Receiving<br />2601 Agriculture Drive<br />Madison, WI 53718 <br />&middot;        SUPPLIES:   dirty supplies are to be sent to: <br />NADP Central Analytical Lab<br />WI State Laboratory of Hygiene - Supply Receiving<br />465 Henry Mall<br />Madison, WI 53706</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required service.  The announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  A contract will be issued in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR 6.302-1 (C).  The associated FSC Code for this is F999, and the associated NAICS Code is 541690.</p>
<p>Offers will be evaluated based on price, proven technical capabilities, and the factors set forth above.  An award will be made to the entity who can meet the specific requirements and is most advantageous to the Government considering price and other related factors on an all or none basis.  This will be a firm fixed-price purchase order, with payment terms of Net 30.</p>
<p>No other additional contractual terms and conditions are applicable. In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, ALL Vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov)</p>
<p>All proposals are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 11:00 am, EST, on Tuesday, September 11, 2018.  Reference Request for Quotation (RFQ) Number NRMAC100-18-01636 in your quotation.

<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the<br />Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her.<br />Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-176 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p><br />4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the<br />Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.  The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA/OAR/ARL/ATDD, plans to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, with Ms. Grace Norman to provide site support and maintenance for the Newton, MS NADP/NTN Site MS 19.  Period of performance:  Requirement is for a base year, plus four option years based on availability of funding as noted below.
<p>Base Year:	September 14, 2018  -  September 13, 2019<br />Option Year 1:  September 14, 2019  -  September 13, 2020<br />Option Year 2:	September 14, 2020  -  September 13, 2021<br />Option Year 3:	September 14, 2021  -  September 13, 2022<br />Option Year 4:	September 14, 2022  -  September 13, 2023</p>
<p>The Newton, Mississippi station (located 2.6 miles west of Newton, Mississippi; 32.3269/-89.2086) is one of approximately 250 stations in the National Atmospheric Deposition Program National Trends Network (NADP/NTN), a joint venture between NOAA, EPA, USDA, USGS, and several other state, federal and private organizations designed to determine trends in the nation's precipitation chemistry.  The Newton, MS site meets NADP siting guidelines and has operated satisfactorily since it began operation in 1986.  Current costs are modest; moving the site or changing the site operator will disrupt a working arrangement that was quite difficult to establish - and selected using a competitive process.  More importantly, moving the site will destroy continuity of our data record, the most important consideration in a trend determination process.  Past difficulties have been encountered in recruiting individuals to perform weekly site tasks 52 weeks/year.  Efforts have been made to recruit additional individuals, however, after a time the individual quit providing support on a part-time basis.</p>
<p>Tasks to be performed.</p>
<p>The work to be performed by Ms. Grace Norman at the Newton, MS station as part of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network will be to continue monitoring precipitation chemistry on a weekly basis according to the methods specified by the NADP/NTN Central Analytical Laboratory in Madison, WI.  The effort requires the following:</p>
<p>-	Routine (at least weekly) maintenance of Aerochem Metrics precipitation collector and official recording gauge.</p>
<p>-	Collection of all precipitation samples on a weekly basis for the entire year. Follow the weekly Tuesday to Tuesday sample collection schedule and submit samples with a completed Field Observer Report Form (FORF) and rain gauge chart to the Central Analytical Laboratory (CAL) for analysis.</p>
<p>-	Packaging and shipping of samples to the NADP Central Analytical Laboratory according to NADP/NTN protocols at least once per week.</p>
<p>-	Site and equipment maintenance as necessary.</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>The operator shall submit all required documentation and site operations forms, sample collection forms, etc., to NADP/NTN and shall maintain an electronic log for maintenance, calibrations, etc.  The full requirements for site operation are specified in the <br />the National Trends Network Site Operations Manual<br />http://nadp.slh.wisc.edu/lib/manuals/NTN_Operations_Manual_v_2-3.pdf<br />Support is to be performed on Tuesdays to stay within NADP operating protocols for NTN sample collection.</p>
<p>&middot;        SAMPLES are to be sent to:<br />NADP Central Analytical Lab<br />WI State Laboratory of Hygiene - Sample Receiving<br />2601 Agriculture Drive<br />Madison, WI 53718 <br />&middot;        SUPPLIES:   dirty supplies are to be sent to: <br />NADP Central Analytical Lab<br />WI State Laboratory of Hygiene - Supply Receiving<br />465 Henry Mall<br />Madison, WI 53706</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Evidence must be provided of ability to provide the required service.  The announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  A contract will be issued in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR 6.302-1 (C).  The associated FSC Code for this is F999, and the associated NAICS Code is 541690.</p>
<p>Offers will be evaluated based on price, proven technical capabilities, and the factors set forth above.  An award will be made to the entity who can meet the specific requirements and is most advantageous to the Government considering price and other related factors on an all or none basis.  This will be a firm fixed-price purchase order, with payment terms of Net 30.</p>
<p>No other additional contractual terms and conditions are applicable. In order to comply with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, ALL Vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov)</p>
<p>All proposals are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 10:00 am, EST, on Wednesday, September 12, 2018.  Reference Request for Quotation (RFQ) Number NRMAC100-18-01556 in your quotation.

<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the<br />Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her.<br />Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-176 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p><br />4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the<br />Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.  The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

<p>a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the<br />Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her.<br />Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-176 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p><br />4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the<br />Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.  The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

Registration with Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System 
As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42.15, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluates Contractor past performance on all contracts that exceed $150,000, and shares those evaluations with other Federal Government contract specialists and procurement officials. The FAR requires that the Contractor be provided an opportunity to comment on past performance evaluations prior to each report closing. To fulfill this requirement VA uses an online database, CPARS, which is maintained by the Naval Seal Logistics Center in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. CPARS has connectivity with the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all Federal agencies. PPIRS is the system used to collect and retrieve performance assessment reports used in source selection determinations and completed CPARS report cards transferred to PPIRS. CPARS also includes access to the federal awardee performance and integrity information system (FAPIIS). FAPIIS is a web-enabled application accessed via CPARS for Contractor responsibility determination information.
Each Contractor whose contract award is estimated to exceed $150,000 requires a CPARS evaluation. A government Focal Point will register your contract within thirty days after contract award and, at that time, you will receive an email message with a User ID (to be used when reviewing evaluations). Additional information regarding the evaluation process can be found at www.cpars.gov or if you have any questions, you may contact the Customer Support Desk @ DSN: 684-1690 or COMM: 207-438-1690. 
For contracts with a period of one year or less, the contracting officer will perform a single evaluation when the contract is complete. For contracts exceeding one year, the contracting officer will evaluate the Contractor s performance annually. Interim reports will be filed each year until the last year of the contract, when the final report will be completed. The report shall be assigned in CPARS to the Contractor s designated representative for comment. The Contractor representative will have sixty (60) days to submit any comments and re-assign the report to the CO.
Failure for the Contractor s representative to respond to the evaluation within those sixty (60) days, will result in the Government s evaluation being placed on file in the database with a statement that the Contractor failed to respond; the Contractor s representative will be  locked out  of the evaluation and may no longer send comments.

<DESC>Mark your calendars and don't miss the first in a series of Air Force Global Strike Command's two Nuclear and Airfield Security Workshops in the fall of 2018 and spring of 2019!  This technology engagement is seeking senior-level technical participants from industry and academic research organizations.  Industry includes both large and small businesses, and the academic community includes all government sponsored and public/private institutes of higher learning.
<p>The 2018 Nuclear and Airfield Security (N&amp;AS) Challenges and Concepts Workshop #1 is the first of two workshops in the Nuclear Deterrence Operations Innovation Summit series.  The primary purpose of this workshop series is to allow communication between AFGSC and other Air Force and DoD partners, industry, academia, and trusted partners (Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs)) on the topic of N&amp;AS updates and potential technology options.  These events will help shape non-DoD investments and bring needed technology options to address DoD N&amp;AS challenges.  Workshop #1 is a two-day event that will occur at the Cyber Innovation Center (6300 East Texas Street, Bossier City, Louisiana) and allows the opportunity for senior government leaders and officials to provide relevant updates and information to interested industry contractors, program managers, and experts at the Secret level.  Workshop #1 will establish an information baseline through government briefings concerning N&amp;AS status as well as current and future technical challenges.  Question and answer sessions are included at the end of each brief to allow industry, academia, and trusted partner (non-DOD) attendees to ask questions for clarification or further explore the topic information from the event.  Workshop #2 (spring 2019) in this Innovational Summit series will provide an opportunity for non-government organizations to submit white papers and possibly be selected to return to AFGSC and brief future technology options to address challenges discussed during Workshop #1.  Additional details concerning Workshop #2 will be provided in a follow-on FBO announcement.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Notice of Intent to award a single source contract. The U.S. Air Force, 42d Contracting Squadron intends on negotiating and issuing a single source firm fixed price (FFP) contract to obtain (10) ten ATI-ES C130-08930-1000-03 NVG Kits for use at Maxwell AFB, AL. The NAICS code used for this requirement is 336413 with a size standard of 1,250 people. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The C-130 H-2 model aircraft at Maxwell AFB require Night Vision Goggle (NVG)-compatible filters due to Mission Capability requirements for operational and training missions. These filters provide for safe NVG use in legacy aircraft, so that aircrew personnel are able to see the instrument panels when NVG's are use. NVGs did not exist when the C-130 H-2 models were manufactured, and many of its instruments are backlit which interferes with NVG technology. Avionics Technologies Incorporated (ATI) Engineering Services LLC is the only known source to create the Night Vision Goggles (NVG)-Compatible Filter Covers Kits for the C-130 H-2. Previous C-130 H-2 NVG Filter kits purchased from ATI are no longer usable and need to be replaced. There is no maintenance correction to fix the instrument problem, nor will there be a future fix because newer model C-130s do not have the NVG compatibility problem. Failure to replace these NVG filter kits would pose a significant risk to both the Air Force and its mission due unacceptable time delays that would result in aircrew members losing flying currency if they are not able to perform quarterly NVG take-off, landing, formation, and airdrop requirements which must be accomplished as part of readiness training for each aircrew member. </span></p>

REQUIRED SERVICES:

STATEMENT OF WORK

BACKGROUND
The James J. Peters Veteran Affairs Medical Center currently has a Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) program that has long-term care patients with limited functionality that do not have the capability to control their surroundings.  The Environmental Control Units (ECU s) provide increased quality of patient care as well a patient safety.  The ECU s allow patients with limited functionality to control their environment and participate in a broad range of activities.  The ECU s have the capabilities to allow patients to control their environment from a tablet device.
In 2014, ECU s were installed in the JJP VAMC in all SCI patient rooms as part of a national contract with Accessibility Services Inc.  Since 2014, the units have become outdated and there are additional features that will provide greater usability for the end users, our Veterans.  For instance, the tablet screens are now larger, the sip and puff technology and eye gaze technology is improved, and the cord that reaches from the wall unit to the bed is longer.  There is an identified need to upgrade the Environmental Control Units (ECUs) throughout the entire SCI program at the JJP VAMC to successfully and effectively provide consistent quality care.
SCOPE:
The Environmental Control Unit is a system that includes a core unit (wall box with a computer, power supply, accessory connections), articulating arm with mounted TV and mounted touchscreen/eye gazed controlled tablet for command functions, wall connection to the patient use a sip and puff or other devices, interface to the nurse call system, and cables.  The upgrade is to replace the wall box components with smaller, more up-to-date components, to replace the tablet with a larger more up-to-date version, to replace the TV, and to replace the
