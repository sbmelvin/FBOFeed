<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with Dr. David Penn to provide theoretical support critical to the development of metrology for advanced advices in the electronics and magnetics industries.  This work involved extensive knowledge of, and skill in, methods of condensed matter theoretical physics as applied to metrology, specifically involving electron tunneling and spin polarization.  Dr. Penn has a unique collection of knowledge and skills in this very narrow area, having worked on such topics for approximately 30 years and is considered the only available source for these services.  The Contractor shall solve, using computer codes, the Boltzman equation for transport of spin polarized electrons in GMR magnetic material and perform studies using condensed matter theory to understand the experimental methods of:  spin polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, atom manipulation using scanning tunneling microscopy, and ferromagnetic- insulator/vacuum-superconductor tunneling.  During the second year of the purchase order, the Contractor shall perform studies using condensed matter theory to understand:  the experimental methods leading to observation of Landau quantization in noble metal surface states using scanning tunneling microscopy, experimental methods of observing indirect exchange coupling mediated by magnetic impurities using spin polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, new and novel experimental methods of scanning tunneling microscopy, and Landau quantization in the InAs 2D electron gas system using scanning tunneling spectroscopy.  The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price purchase order on or about August 12, 2002.  The proposed requirement is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, the Government will consider all capability statements received by August 12, 2002.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to enter into a sole source purchase order with the Georgia Institute of Technology to provide technical assistance to the Optical Technology Division.  Professor Zhoumin Zhang of the School of Mechanical Engineering of Georgia Tech is the world's expert in the areas of radiative transfer and optical properties modeling, heat transfer, and rapid thermal processing (RTP) temperature measurement metrology.  Additionally, Professor Zhang has particular knowledge of the NIST RTP testbed and research.  The contract will allow NIST to acquire capabilities to predict optical properties (reflectivity, emissivity, transmissivity, etc.) for a variety of material of importance to semiconductor manufacturing.  The optical properties prediction computer program and associated database to be delivered as part of this effort will be validated by measurements at NIST.  The Contractor shall undertake a systematic and critical investigation of the optical constants of semiconductor materials to include: Si, SiO2, and Si3N3, and doped Si for integration into an optical constant database.  Additionally, the Contractor shall develop a theoretical model and interactive computer program which uses the database from the previous task to calculate the emissivity, reflectivity, and transmissivity as a function of wave length and temperature of wafers with single and multiple thin film layers of viable thickness as found in semiconductor manufacturing.

<DESC>The Department of Justice, Environmental and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) and the Tax Division, have a continuing requirement for a contractor to provide various nonpersonal administrative support services such as copy, file, and supply room operations, scanning and faxing services, interbuilding mail messenger services, and copy machine maintenance.  The contract is available for use by all DOJ components, but its focus is on the ENRD and Tax Divisions.  The contractor shall be responsible for providing and supervising sufficient qualified staff (est. at 45-65 positions), providing and maintaining equipment, vehicles, and supplies, in order to successfully perform these tasks for ENRD and Tax at fixed unit prices per month, fixed price per piece, and on a labor hour (t&m), ID/IQ basis.  The predominant place of performance is the Washington, DC metropolitan area, with some staffing to be provided in Denver, CO, and copy machine maintenance to be provided in other cities such as Sacramento and San Francisco, CA, Seattle, WA, and Anchorage, AK.  The anticipated period of performance is October 1, 2002 through September 30, 2003, with four additional option years available to extend the term of the contract through September 30, 2007.  The current contract (DOJ No. 97-C-0037) providing these services expires 09/30/2002 but may be extended if needed.  This RFP will be a "full and open" competition for a single contractor to provide the entirety of the requirements; accordingly any proposals to provide only parts of the requirements will not be considered.  No advance information or meetings regarding the RFP are available at this time - it is anticipated that the RFP will be uploaded to the EPS not later than June 5, 2002.  This contract is subject to the Service Contract Act of 1965 and large business offerors will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan.  However, this RFP requirement is not a set-aside of any type.

<DESC>This is the re-establishment/re-posting of the synopsis which first appeared on May 2, 2002. The revised estimated RFP issuance date is July 29, 2002.  Thank you for your patience on this matter. Repeat of original synopsis:
The Department of Justice, Environmental and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) and the Tax Division, have a continuing requirement for a contractor to provide various nonpersonal administrative support services such as copy, file, and supply room operations, scanning and faxing services, interbuilding mail messenger services, and copy machine maintenance.  The contract is available for use by all DOJ components, but its focus is on the ENRD and Tax Divisions.  The contractor shall be responsible for providing and supervising sufficient qualified staff (est. at 45-65 positions), providing and maintaining equipment, vehicles, and supplies, in order to successfully perform these tasks for ENRD and Tax at fixed unit prices per month, fixed price per piece, and on a labor hour (t&m), ID/IQ basis.  The predominant place of performance is the Washington, DC metropolitan area, with some staffing to be provided in Denver, CO, and copy machine maintenance to be provided in other cities such as Sacramento and San Francisco, CA, Seattle, WA, and Anchorage, AK.  The anticipated period of performance is October 1, 2002 through September 30, 2003, with four additional option years available to extend the term of the contract through September 30, 2007.  The current contract (DOJ No. 97-C-0037) providing these services expires 09/30/2002 but may be extended if needed.  This RFP will be a "full and open" competition for a single contractor to provide the entirety of the requirements; accordingly any proposals to provide only parts of the requirements will not be considered.  No advance information or meetings regarding the RFP are available at this time - it is anticipated that the RFP will be uploaded to the EPS not later than June 5, 2002.  This contract is subject to the Service Contract Act of 1965 and large business offerors will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan.  However, this RFP requirement is not a set-aside of any type.
