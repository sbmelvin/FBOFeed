Underplanting Sites: The following areas consist of commercial sized trees with natural openings and openings created by logging activity. Openings that are greater than 80 feet in diameter will be planted using primarily Douglas-fir or white pine.  Cedar, hemlock and grand fi r will be planted around the edges of openings greater than 80 feet in diameter.  Cedar, hemlock and grand fir will also be planted in openings smaller than 80 feet in diameter.  All open areas will be planted on an 8x8 spacing where possible.  An 8x8 spac ing will not be possible in many areas due to natural regeneration, brush, slash piles or other obstacles.  When obstacles to planting exist, seedlings will be planted on the smallest spacing that is possible without getting closer than 8 feet to another s eedling, and without planting under brush that would hamper seedling survival. Seedlings will not be planted within 12 feet of trees over 15 feet tall. Large parts of the stand in between canopy gaps will remain unplanted. Tree planters can expect to cover  less than half of the total acreage when planting and looking for planting spots.  Acreage covered varies from site to site.

·	Quality Control/Performance Standards:  SOW must be performance based and include measurable performance metrics with a list of proposed inspection methods and proposed acceptance levels. 
·	Corporate Experience/Past Performance and Key Personnel Experience:  Contractor should list all relevant corporate experience.  Contractors past performance and sub-contractor’s past performance should be listed.  Resumes of all key personnel should be listed.


4.  Down Select and Discussions

The Government reserves the right to conduct a proposal down select and only hold discussions with the offeror(s) who best meet the solicitation evaluation criteria.  Discussions will not be held with any offeror eliminated during the down select.  The Government also reserves the right not to hold discussions with any of the offerors if the Contracting Officer determines that discussions are not necessary for this requirement.


5.  Basis for Award

The Government plans to award a contract to the offeror whose proposal is most advantageous and is the best value to the Government.  Technical excellence is more important than cost/price and the Government reserves the right to award to other than the low bidder. 

Each technical evaluation factor and cost realism, and reasonableness will be given an Adjectival Rating of Outstanding, Very Good, Average, Poor or Not Applicable.

6.  Evaluation Criteria

The technical evaluation factors for award, in descending order of importance, are as follows:

·	Corporate Experience/Past Performance
·	Technical and Management Approach
·	Organizational Conflict of Interest
·	Key Personnel

·	Corporate Experience/Past Performance.  The Government will evaluate the relevance and applicability of the offeror's corporate experience and past performance to the successful completion of the requirement.  Relevant past performance information of the contractor and proposed subcontractors must be included. 
·	Technical Approach and Management Approach.  The Government will evaluate the offeror's SOW for the technical and management approach that best satisfies the performance measurement requirement that were listed in the SOO.  The technical and management approach will receive two adjectival ratings.  The first rating will be for the initial phase of the project (line item 0001) and the second rating will be the offeror’s conception of subsequent phases of the performance measurement project.  There should be a SOW chapter for the technical and management approach during the initial phase of the project and a separate chapter for technical and management approaches during subsequent phases of the project.  Offerors are reminded that part of the technical and management approach should be a project timetable with important milestones for both completing the project and milestones for proposed project deliverables.
·	Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI).  The Government is concerned that the contractor awarded this contract could have the opportunity to obtain proprietary information that could effect financial transactions of the Bank and might also effect private sector competition.  Page 2 of the RFQ lists Clause H-101.  The clause states, “In accordance with FAR 9.504, the Contracting Officer has determined the potential for perceived or actual Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) issues related to this acquisition.  Specifically, the potential OCI issue involves access to proprietary information, including confidential business information submitted to Ex-Im Bank by outside parties.  To the extent possible, Ex-Im Bank intends to limit the successful offeror's access to such information.  Nonetheless, as part of their offer, each potential source must identify potential OCIs and must provide an OCI mitigation plan that addresses, in detail, how they plan to mitigate these issues.  An example of a potential mitigant would be to agree to limit the interchange between the organizational unit that is performing the work under the contract and those units that ordinarily interact with Ex-Im Bank.  Mitigation plans will be evaluated as part of the basis for award.  Proper implementation of an adequate OCI Mitigation Plan is considered critical to the performance of the contract work.  The contract award will contain the requirement to implement the approved, agreed OCI Mitigation Plan.”  Each offeror must submit an OCI mitigation plan that addresses how they will mitigate any potential for gaining an unfair competitive advantage in future contracts or financial transactions with Ex-Im Bank.  Each offeror’s OCI mitigation plan will be evaluated for quality, technical soundness, and feasibility.  
·	Key Personnel.  The Government will evaluate the offeror on the experience, skills and qualifications of the proposed Key Personnel to successfully complete the requirement.  The Government will evaluate the proposed Key Personnel's ability to successfully complete the requirements based on their recent past success and productivity on relevant projects.

7.  Data Release Restrictions

·	No offeror shall disclose any technical or programmatic information that they receive about the Bank or its systems (not already available to the public) without the specific approval of the Contractor Officer.  All offerors shall submit certification of their agreement not to disclose this information as a condition of award.  The successful offeror will be required to sign the Bank’s standard non-disclosure form.

·	Offerors submitting restrictive data shall mark it in accordance with the FAR Clause 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors—Competitive Acquisition.


 
Statement of Objectives: Performance Measurement Project

1.   Background:  In support of the President’s Management Agenda to make government more market-driven and citizen centered, The Export-Import Bank of the U.S. (Ex-Im Bank or Bank) reorganized in October 2002.  The general objectives of the reorganization were to enhance productivity and customer service. As a result of the reorganization, two former single-product divisions, the Insurance Division and the Trade Finance Division, were merged into for a single unit that provides all Bank products and manages customer relationships.   A new business unit was created to focus solely on credit and risk management, including credit underwriting of transactions. 

2.    Purpose.  With the new organizational structure established, Ex-Im Bank has begun a program to enhance its business processes to support the objectives of the reorganization.  As an initial step, the Bank recently adopted operational performance measures to improve: (i) transaction efficiency and cycle time, (ii) resource utilization, and (iii) customer satisfaction.  The Bank seeks to use a disciplined process methodology with demonstrated success in a financial services institution to guide its process improvements and meet its performance goals.  The initial phase of this project is process enhancements that will be of significant value to the customers of the Bank focusing on methods to shorten the cycle time for Medium Term products.  These methods would result in “low impact process changes” (see Glossary).  Loan disbursement is not a part of the initial phase of this requirement.

3.   Status of performance measurement at Ex-Im Bank. 
(a)  The Bank has adopted performance measures and measurement methods.  
(i) 	Transaction efficiency and cycle time.  Transaction efficiency will be measured by the number of labor/hours per transaction, or component of transactions.  Cycle time will be measured by the number of business days between selected milestones of the transaction process.
(ii) 	Resource utilization.  Resource utilization will be measured as a percentage of the level of authorizations committed per fiscal year compared with the budget authority made available by Congress.
(iii) 	Customer satisfaction.  Customer satisfaction will be measured by a survey.  The Bank periodically performs customer satisfaction surveys.  However, measurement of transaction volume or of repeat business is not part of that survey.
(b)  The Bank’s initial focus will be on cycle time reduction.  Based on discussions with a range of Bank customers, including exporters, buyers, brokers and lenders, reducing transaction cycle time is the improvement of most significant and immediate value to customers.  As the Bank implements performance measures, its initial goal is to put into service a plan for measuring, reporting, and managing cycle time.  
(c)  The Bank has begun a pilot program to reduce cycle time for its medium-term transactions.  
(i) 	Performance goals. The Bank’s medium term products (loan, guaranty, and insurance) comprise about 500 transactions annually.  The Bank has adopted two cycle-time performance goals: 
·	approving 80% of requests within 20 business days of application (compared to a historical average 63% within 20 business days.); and
·	as a subset of the above cycle, completing the credit underwriting component of 80% of the medium-term transactions within 15 business days. 
(ii) 	Reporting The Bank has begun monthly performance reporting to groups of its most active customers. To support these improvements, the Bank has simplified and streamlined its application process and clarifying its credit information requirements.
(iii) 	In reviewing the application process, the Bank discovered that it was not collecting the correct information in some cases, and in other cases significant portions of the information needed was not requested in the application.  Underwriting developed a supplement to the official application to obtain the additional information needed for application processing.

4.   Scope of initial phase.
(a)  The Bank will approach the project in phases, with the first phase focused on refining and operationalizing the medium-term prototype from receipt of application to approval, focusing on near-term, low-impact process changes that will assist us in meeting the two cycle-time goals.  The transaction application process has five sequential components: (1) mail room; (2) the central applications and process unit for the initial review for completeness; (3) Trade Finance & Insurance (TF&I) for a more in depth completeness review; (4) Underwriting; and (5) return  TF&I to be put in final form for approval.  The approval level depends on the amount of the transaction.
(b)  Constraints.  This project will be subject to the following constraints:
(i) 	For the initial phase, the two cycle time goals for the medium-term products will remain constant.
(ii) 	For the initial phase, no substantive changes will be made to the application forms.
(iii) 	The initial phase will result in recommendations, not implementation of any changes.
(c)  For the proposal, we expect the contractor to design a Phase 1 work plan, using a disciplined process methodology, focusing on the metrics, processing improvements, analysis and reporting procedures for the medium term transactions.  The successful contractor will be expected to implement their proposed Phase 1 Work Plan upon award of the contract.  We expect that Phase 1 would result in recommendations in 60-90 days.  At the end of Phase 1, we will review the program and decide on the scope and sequence of follow-on phases. 
5.   Scope of subsequent project phase:  Depending on the success of the first phase, additional closely related phases, not yet defined, are anticipated and may be awarded to the successful offeror without additional competition.  Each offeror’s SOW will present proposed methodologies for subsequent phases to this requirement.
6.   Technical approach
(a)  Project Plan.  The Bank seeks to use a disciplined process methodology with demonstrated success in a financial services institution to guide its process improvements.  The Bank envisions that the complete plan will encompass answers to the following questions:
(i) 	Performance metrics and indicators for cycle time and efficiency.  
·	Definition.  Do the proposed performance indicators align with the goals?  Do they measure the improvements that are most valuable for the customer?  For example, should the Bank’s cycle time goal include the time from transaction approval to disbursement?  How can variability in the transaction process be eliminated?
·	Measurement.  Do the Bank’s information and management systems  have the capability to provide complete, accurate, and timely measurements for these performance indicators?  In other projects Ex-Im Bank is working on an enterprise architect requirement and also on other IT projects.  We are interested in IT solutions that may help with this process, but we do not believe that an IT solution alone will fully address our performance measurement requirement.  Attachment 1 to this SOO is an enterprise architecture chart.  It is attached for informational purposes only.  The Bank does not currently have an automated work flow process but one is being developed under a collateral project.
·	Analysis and Reporting.  What is the best way to analyze and report this information to management, employees, and customers?
(b)  Improvements.  How can the performance measures be used to enhance the Bank’s capabilities and effect changes of benefit to customers?  How can the Bank institutionalize its capabilities to support continuous improvement in its business processes?
(i) 	Automation and streamlining.  How could standardization and automation of forms and requirements for information improve the clarity, speed, and accuracy of transactions for customers?
(ii) 	Improving support for multiple products.  As part of moving from a product-based to a customer-based structure, how could the Bank enhance its capabilities for one-stop shopping and service for all its products?
(iii) 	Cost ROM/ROI.  What is the rough order of magnitude (ROM) of the cost of implementing the recommended changes and what return on investment (ROI) could be expected?
7.   Glossary Terms:
·	Bank’s Products: Loans, loan guarantees, and insurance policies issued to financial institutions and exports of U.S. goods and services.
·	Low-Impact Process Changes: Changes that do not require Bank reorganization and retraining efforts or major technical changes.
·	Medium Term Products: Loans, loan guarantees, and insurance policies with financed amounts up to $10 million and repayment terms less than seven (7) years.
·	Medium Term Transactions: Transactions involving the Bank's Medium-term Products.
·	Resource Utilization: The percentage of the level of authorizations committed per fiscal year compared with the budget authority made available by Congress
·	Transaction: The processing, approval, documentation, and servicing of a request for a loan, loan guarantee, or insurance policy.  For the purpose of Phase I of the project, the definition of a transaction will be limited to the application processing and approval components of the process.
·	Transaction Efficiency: The number of labor/hours per transaction, or component of transactions.

<CONTACT>Mr. Michael Cunningham,  buyer, (781) 377-0462, Michael.Cunningham@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>COTS SW AND WEB-SERVICES EVALUATION AND NIAP/COE TESTING. This notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Margaret Corasick (781) 377-9372.   I. INTRODUCTION. The Air Force Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Software Infrastructure Program Area Directorate is soliciting proposals from  Not For Profit Organizations or Non-profit Organizations to expand the knowledge of evolving software, software security, and software for research and development (R&D). This includes concepts and prototype implementation in the area of Web-Services, and Commercial Off the Shelf/Government off the Shelf (COTS/GOTS) SW testing and compliance evaluation.   Concepts for testing and evaluation, lab implementations and organizational interfaces proposed may represent novel dedicated technologies and/or dual use of new emerging commercial SW technology. Significant work has been accomplished to date through the National Product Line Assessment Center (NPLACE) efforts, and the Government seeks to build and expand on this repository of COTS/GOTS knowledge, which will continue to be accessible to the public. 		II. Background.  The purpose of NPLACE is to apply technical models for evaluating software products against COE and National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) for evaluating Information Technology Security Products (NIST) criteria for software development and security.  This evaluation venue is best provided by a not for profit organization or a non-profit organization with no financial interests in the software evaluation results.  NPLACE tests evaluates COTS/GOTS and software products under various procedures and criteria to include utilizing Common Operating Environment (COE) compliance testing for Department of Defense (DoD) use and National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) certification testing for information technology security products.  Under this agreement, between the selected offeror and the Government, NPLACE will expand its expertise in four areas:  First, suitability testing to minimize the confusion associated with using COTS software in a system environment by testing against pre-defined criteria and presenting appropriate decision-making information in an interactive web-based repository.  Second, COE compliance testing to ensure a product provides the common software infrastructure, which the COE software, databases, and applications execute.  Third, National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) certification testing to determine if products meet the security testing, evaluation, and assessment needs of both information technology producers and consumers, will be a key evolving COTS/GOTS issue.  Finally, web services implementations will be analyzed and prototyped.  		The decision to fund a full proposal will be based on funds availability, overall scientific and technical merit, and potential contribution to the Air Force, Defense Department agencies, and State and local Governments. The Government anticipates one award, but reserves the right to make no selection. The Proposal identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the complexity of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between all parties, and other factors. Anticipated award will be 12 months. The award period may be extended an additional 48 months based upon proposed effort and availability of funding. Presently we anticipate funding to be $3-4 million/year.  Any awards are subject to the continued availability of appropriations. There is no commitment by the Government to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award.  No request for proposal (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made. 		III. Required Submittals.  Submit Full Proposals in two (2) volumes:  		1.	 VOLUME I  TECHNICAL PROPOSAL, not exceed twenty-five (25) single sided pages (excluding graphs and charts) with no smaller than 10 font.  Submit electronic copies to Mr. Cunningham in MS word format.  The technical proposal should include the following three sections: Section 1 - Executive Summary: Provide a brief technical and business description of the contents of the proposal. The technical area should address the proposal's technical goals, approach, and expected results. The business area should address business and/or commercial applications of the proposed technology. Section 2 - Technical Issues: Detail the technical approach, objectives, staffing and resources relating to the development of the proposed technology for military and commercial (if applicable) use; discuss specifically in realistic terms the technical objectives of this proposed effort; a concise Statement of Work (SOW) and Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) that discusses the specific tasks to be accomplished, tied to the specific approach and goals of expanding the COTS/GOTS knowledge base and responsive to the SOO provided; discuss deliverable items such as software test plans, descriptions and other essential documentation; discuss methods of disseminating this knowledge; provide resumes for Principal Investigator(s) and other key research personnel; describe the current and planned facilities and equipment to accomplish the research objectives; and, give a description of past performance on similar efforts within the last 3 years (including references); discussion interface with other non profit and not for profit organizations, educational institutions.  Section 3 - Business Issues: Discuss the business issues relating to the commercial applications of the proposed development and its impact on the market; detail benefits to the Department of Defense (DoD).  Section 4 - A roadmap that expands on the efforts to date and present a clear and concise plan to further COTS/GOTS SW evaluations to aid government and industry. 		2.	VOLUME II - COST/FUNDING PROPOSAL. Cost/funding proposals are not restricted in length, have no specific page layout requirements, and should address funding periods of performance. Formal work breakdown structures and certified cost or pricing data are neither required nor desired, however, ESC reserves the right the request this information for proposals using FAR/DFARS type contracts. Organize Cost/Funding proposals in the following order: Total Project Cost: This section will give a detailed breakdown of costs of the project. Cost should also be broken for each task appearing in the proposed Statement of Work and, if applicable, cost shared by the offeror including In-Kind costs from the non profit or not for profit organization, State and local agencies or affiliated small businesses.   Present the following information for each phase of the effort: total cost of the particular project phase; total offeror cost share, if applicable; funding requested from the Government; and elements of cost (labor categories and applicable rates, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, and cost of money). Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, subcontractor proposals/quotes, equipment purchases, fair market rental value of leased items, and the method used for making such valuations.  		Full proposals will be considered to be either selectable or non-selectable based on their evaluation in accordance with the criteria as follows. Offerors will be promptly notified of the evaluation results.  		Evaluation of proposals will be performed using the following criteria:  1) The technical merits of the proposed processes, with the ability to accomplish COE and NIAP efforts; 2) The potential to broaden the existing technology base; 3) Accessibility and contacts with software providers and users; 4) The qualifications, capabilities, experience, past performance, and present accomplishments of the key personnel who are responsible for the project; 5) The proposed infrastructure (experimental, computers, administrative) to accomplish the objectives of the proposals; and 6) Budget realism and reasonableness of cost; 7) The impact to HUB zone; 8) Affiliation with minority businesses, large businesses, educational institutions and interactions with State and local Governments; 9) Cost realism and reasonableness of the initial award; 10) Cost reasonableness for cost plan associated with the Roadmap.  		IV. Notification and Required Certifications.

<DESC>NAICS Code 236220 - This sources sought synopsis announces commencement of the selection process for Construction Manager as constructor (CMc) services for construction of a new courthouse in Salt Lake City, UT.  This preliminary announcement is issued to provide general information regarding proposed selection procedures, solicit comments on the proposed procedures, and gauge interest of prime contractors.  Additional information will be provided in a subsequent announcement to be issued in approximately one month.  

PROJECT SUMMARY - The new US District Courthouse will be a free standing building constructed on a site located in downtown Salt Lake City, UT adjacent to the existing Frank E. Moss Courthouse.  The new facility will contain approximately 354,980 gross square feet of building area., with 222,960 square feet of occupiable area and parking for approximately 60 vehicles.  The site is located on land bounded on the west by West Temple Street, to the north by Market Street, to the south by 400 South Street and to the east by the existing Courthouse (which faces Main Street).  The estimated construction cost is $70 - $90 million.

The Moss Courthouse, built in 1905 is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is part of the Exchange Place Historic District. With the proximity to the existing courthouse, the new courthouse will build upon the existing context and create an urban complex, which defines the Federal Judiciary.  After completion of land acquisition and certain environmental reviews, GSA will clear the site and contract for initial excavation and remediation of the site.

SCOPE - Services provided under this solicitation will include participation by three contractors during the design phase to review drawings and specification at the completion of Design Development and 95% design completion to validate constructibility, confirm estimated costs and provide value engineering ideas to enhance the project.  At the completion of this phase, one contractor will be selected to construct the building.

SELECTION PROCESS - A FedBizOpps announcement will be issued in approximately one month to set forth the technical and price evaluation factors to be used in the solicitation.  It is anticipated that technical factors will be more important than price.  Approximately 15 days after publication of the announcement, a Request For Proposal (RFP) will be issued.  A preproposal conference and small business conference is planned for approximately two to three weeks after issuance of the RFP.

Contractors are requested to respond to this announcement via email to steven.eckelberg@gsa.gov to provide comments on the proposed solicitation process and/or express interest in the project.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Mandus Group Ltd., 101 Edgewood Lane, Long Grove, IA for sixty (60) KJ4000 Oil Transfer Systems with ancillary equipment.  Mandus Group Ltd. is the designer, manufacturer, and sole supplier of the KJ4000.  The KJ4000 will replenish M198/LW155 Howitzer’s M45/M77 recoil systems by draining, refilling and topping off oil reserves.  The KJ4000 is engineered to be self-purging--eliminating air from the lines prior to pumping.  It accepts oil from a pressurized system into its reservoir allowing for the reuse.  Operational Characteristics:  the KJ4000 provides .59 GPM and the oil is filtered through a .5 micron high-pressure filter.  Benefits include the reduction in maintenance man-hours, oil spills, and oil waste and a reduction in the likelihood of contaminants reaching the recoil systems.  This is a COTS, NDI purchase.  No RFP is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement by 01 August 2003 to Anita Norris, 703-432-4181.  See numbered note 22.

A greater awareness and involvement of Hispanic investigators in CMS programs will serve four important purposes: 1) to conduct research on issues that have an impact on the health status of the Hispanic American community.  2) To serve as a bridge between CMS and Hispanic investigators that has a significant impact on the health of Hispanic Americans.  3) To increase the pool of Hispanic investigators available in carrying out the research, demonstration, and evaluation activities of CMS.  4) To fulfill the spirit of Executive Order 13230 (HAA) in which the President has order federal agencies to support the development and increased the utilization of the resources that exist at HSIs.  UTSA is the third largest component university in the University of Texas System and has been one of the state’s fastest growing public universities for much of the last decade and is predicted to increase by more than 40% in the next 15 years, reaching nearly 26,000 by the year 2010. Because of UTSA’s Hispanic enrollment, UTSA has been designated as a Hispanic Serving Institution (HIS) and is ranked sixth in the overall number of undergraduate degrees conferred to Hispanic (Source: National Center for Education Studies and Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education).  These rankings also show eight other undergraduate degree programs at UTSA among the top ten nationally in the number of degrees awarded go Hispanic students.  UTSA also ranked third in business, marketing, and teacher education degrees.  UTSA is the fourth largest provider of teacher education degrees in the State of Texas.  The University leads the nation in the number of undergraduate degrees conferred in the biological sciences awarded to Hispanic (Source: Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education).  Moreover, by the year 2010, UTSA is predicted to have 33% of all UTSA students from under-represented groups enrolled in what the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board has identified as “critical fields” – science and engineering, teacher education, and business.  In addition, the number of undergraduate students earning degrees has increased 26%in the last five years while the number of graduate degrees granted has increased 68% respectively.  These increases have occurred primarily in the sciences, engineering and behavioral sciences.  Moreover, graduate student’s GRE scores have increased by 80 points in the last five years.  In addition, minority students at UTSA now earn 63% of all master’s degrees granted compared to only 22% during 1989-1990.  The University of Texas at San Antonio is committed to freedom of inquiry and the creation of an environment in which people can teach, discover, learn, and enrich themselves and their community.  Through its instructional, research, and public services programs, UTSA seeks to fulfill its mission, served the needs of the multicultural population of San Antonio and the South Texas region, both on its main campus and at UTSA Down town, and emphasize programs that contribute to the technological, economic, and cultural development of the city, region, and state. The University has developed and implemented a set of four strategic directions which include:  1) UTSA will move toward national recognition as a model of the new comprehensive metropolitan university; 2) UTSA will become a national center of excellence for the education of Hispanics at the master’s and doctoral levels and will assume leadership in research on Hispanic issues; 3) UTSA will become a model of university linkages with the city and region to address goals of mutual concern; 4) UTSA will become a center for international programs, with particular emphasis on inter-American programs; 5)UTSA will become a Center of Excellence for the use of information technologies to strengthen teaching, learning, research, and creative activity; to foster effective internal and external communication; and to ensure quality service, content, and delivery to each of its constituents.  CMS's HAA Workgroup determined that the assistance of the aforementioned HSI will provide creditability and knowledge of HSIs researchers, imperative to CMS and that the proposed vendor has unique skills, experiences, and capability to coordinate and manage this workshop.

<DESC>The Command and Control Engineering Center (C2CEN), USCG intends to purchase on a non-competitive basis with Trimble Navigation, Ltd , Sunnyvale, CA proprietary software developed for use on Coast Guard Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS).  The Coast Guard DGPS broadcast network uses a Trimble 4000IM MSK Integrity Monitor (IM) to provide high-precision positioning and integrity monitoring functions.  The IM generates required Radio Technical Commission for Maritime (RTCM) Special Committee (SC) 104 data messages for the Reference Station (RS).  The RS in turn generates RTCM SC-104 messages and modulates those messages into a medium frequency (MF) signal that is fed to a radio frequency linear power amplifier (RFLPA).  A problem exists because the Trimble 4000IM is no longer manufactured yet the Coast Guard has over 80 DGPS sites nationwide that depend on the 4000IM functions.  A replacement method of detecting GPS error integrity and formulating the required RTCM SC-104 messages for the RS is needed.  Based on work being done by USCG NAVCEN on RS firmware to software porting, IM functions could be done via software installed on a commercial off the shelf (COTS) windows based PC platform with the addition of a communications board.  The required software must be based on proprietary firmware in the Trimble 4000 IM.  This  procurement will be processed in accordance with FAR Part 13.  This proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The software is to be tested in Portsmouth, VA.  The NAICS Code is 541511.  Telephone requests will not be accepted.  Requests via fax (757) 686-4018 will be accepted or e-mail chouck@c2cen.uscg.mil.  See Note 22

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke (NINDS), Developmental and Metabolic Neurology Branch (DMNB), plans to procure arrays and kits from Affymetrix Inc., 3380 Central Expressway, Santa Clara, CA  95051.  Part of the DMNB branch mission involves the study of Fabry disease .  A knock-out mouse model of Fabry disease was created several years ago.  This murine analog of Fabry disease has allowed closer study of a number of aspects of the disorder.  However, one of the remaining substantial questions relates to the effect of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on gene expression in Fabry disease.  Recent advances in gene chip technology allows the extensive examination of mouse transcriptome.  It is anticipated that examination of gene expression levels (transcriptome) in the Fabry mouse will develop understanding of inter-related specific gene expression abnormalities and there relationship to the primary pathology of Fabry disease.  These are the only arrays and kits that are compatible with the existing Government owned Affymetrix equipment and will be used in continuation of ongoing experiments.  It is critical that new variables not be introduced into these on-going protocols.  Therefore, these arrays and kits must be procured from Affymetrix. This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on July 30, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) plans to procure Invitrogen Kits Reagents from Invitrogen, 3175 Staley Road, Grand Island, NY 14072.  The CDP is supporting a confirmation study of promising molecular profiles in stage I lung adenocarcinomas. The study of 600 new Stage I lung adenocarcinomas will be carried out at four academic analytical sites, University of Michigan Medical School, Dana Farber Cancer Research Institute, Moffitt Cancer Center and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  The kits and reagents from Invitrogen are for the initial stages of sample preparation prior to analysis on the Affymetrix Gene Chip System.  It was selected because it is currently being used at all sites and they are familiar with the quality of the cDNA generated using the kit and because it gives the most consistent and reproducible data.  The reagent requested is supplied specifically for use with microarray experiments.  Although it is available from other vendors, the Invitrogen product was used in the initial study.  Use of the requested kit and reagent will insure that the variability in the data is minimized.  This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.

<DESC>The US Department of Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity GovWorks, will manage the following procurement action on behalf of the US Department of Agriculture Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and the Farm Service Agency.  The FARM SECURITY AND RURAL INVESTMENT ACT OF 2002, commonly called the 2002 Farm Bill, requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to develop a comprehensive information management system to be used in implementing the programs administered by USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC).  The Farm Bill also requires USDA to utilize the services of a non-Federal entity to assist in the development of such a system, and requires that a preference be given to entities that have prior experience with the information and management systems of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, and that have collaborated with the Corporation in the development of the identification procedures required by section 515(f) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1515(f)).  USDA expects the contractor to provide assistance to USDA in the development of a comprehensive information management system for FCIC and FSA Programs.  This system is commonly known as the RMA/FSA Common Information System, or CIS.

When the solicitation for this project is released, strong preference in the selection of the project Contractor will be given to Offerors who satisfy the Legislatively Mandated Criteria: (1) prior experience with the information and management systems of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation; and (2) collaboration with the Corporation in the development of the identification procedures required by section 515(f) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1515(f)).  The Government anticipates that a level of effort contract in the range of $3.5MM to $4.5M will be negotiated to cover five program phases that will span the time period from mid-2003 until late 2006.  Program details and proposal requirements will be provided with the solicitation.

<DESC>This document serves as a formal Pre-Solicitation Notice for SSA-RFP-03-0539. On January 2, 2003 the Social Security Administration published an Initial Public Announcement for an A-76 Full Cost Comparison Study for Information Technology Help-Desk Services In the FedBizOps forum (Reference Number: SSA-A76-HELPDESK), and on July 27, 2003 SSA published a modification to this Initial Public Announcement. The Help-Desk services under study support all SSA users of information technology, specifically in the identification, diagnosis, and resolution of problems involving information technology hardware and software. The incumbent service provider currently performing the activity under study is the Social Security Administration/ Office of Systems. The activity under study is currently provided at the Social Security Administration’s headquarters in Woodlawn, MD and at six Remote Operations Communications Centers located in: Philadelphia, PA; Richmond, CA; Birmingham, AL; Jamaica, NY; Chicago, IL; Kansas City, MO. At the time of this announcement the number of Government personnel (FTEs) performing the activity is sixty-eight (68) These incumbent Government service provider FTEs are augmented by private sector contractor staff numbering forty-seven (47) persons. All of the Government FTEs and contractor personnel identified herein are subject to this A-76 study. SSA anticipates release of a formal solicitation/ Request For Proposals, SSA-RFP-03-0539, for this A-76 Standard Competition in the FedBizOps forum on or about July, 17, 2003. 

The Social Security Administration anticipates awarding a one year firm-fixed price contract, with four option years for Information Technology Help-Desk Services. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541519, “Other Computer Related Services”, with a size standard of $21,000,000.00. SSA’s market research and analysis has identified multiple potential small businesses, either solely or in partnership arrangements, that appear capable of meeting the Government’s requirements. As a result of this analysis, this procurement will be a 100% small business set-aside, as prescribed at FAR 19.502-2. (See Number Note 1) 


Additional information regarding this study, specifically a DRAFT copy of the Performance Work Statement (PWS), is contained as an attachment to this pre-solicitation announcement (file name: DRAFT SSA A-76 Help-Desk PWS.doc). Interested parties are encouraged to reference this attached document, and provide comments or questions, regarding this pre-solicitation notice or the attached DRAFT Performance Work Statement, by COB 7/7/03.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>RFP OAM-2003-N-0026, Microsoft Premier Services. The purpose of this modification #3 is to provide  responses to  questions received and to issue a closing date for submission of  questions on this requirement.  1. Are you looking for a contractor to: (1) coordinate a subscription to Microsoft Corporation's Premier Support Services, or (2) actually provide the services described in the REQUIREMENTS section of the solicitation?   Answer: GAO's combined synopsis/solicitation OAM-2003-N-0026 published June 24, 2003 at www.fbo.gov documents GAO's requirement for an annual subscription to Microsoft Corporation's Premier Support Services. This Service is solely provided by Microsoft Corporation. GAO is not seeking this type of support to be provided by other than Microsoft Corporation under their Premier Support Services program. Because Microsoft does resell Premier Support Services through various resellers, we identified this as an opportunity to compete for best price.  Whether the service is provided by Microsoft, or through a reseller, is not of prime importance.  What is critical is that what is acquired is the Premier Support Services subscription offered by Microsoft Corporation.  2. Does the license need to be purchased?  Answer:  GAO intends to award a contract as the requirements are stated in GAO’s combined synopsis/solicitation OAM-2003-N-0026, published June 24, 2003.  GAO will be acquiring a subscription to Microsoft  Premier Support  Services.  3.  What would the monthly time requirement to support section and where/how are the roundtable discussions held?  Answer:  Technical Information Services and Roundtable Discussions are standard features of Microsoft’s Premier Support  Services.  GAO does not collect usage data on these standard features.  GAO will not entertain further questions.

<DESC>This is a wildlife enhancement project that involves cutting a mosaic of small patches in aspen to promote structural diversity for a variety of wildlife species.   Hazardous fuels and slash generated will be treated either by mechanical mastication or machine piling. 

Increase diversity of structural stages within 160 acres of aspen/spruce/cottonwood in the Quartz 35 project area by cutting 29 acres of small patch cuts in a variety of shapes and sizes (0.2- 8.4 acres) interspersed within bands of denser cover.  Increase early successional stages of aspen to promote growth of browse for moose, while retaining late succession stages for cavity nesting birds.  Improve habitat for ruffed grouse by promoting 4 successional stages in close proximity (openings, seedlings and saplings, open mid-aged stands, and mature stages).  Improve habitat for other species associated with grouse habitat such as: black bear, rabbits, and songbirds.   Retain 3-4 large downed logs/acre for ruffed grouse drumming posts and habitat for small mammals.  Retain large existing snags and live trees for cavity nesting birds and to promote large snags and logs over time.   Maintain habitat for spruce grouse

The purpose of the project is to have the contractor furnish all labor, equipment, fuel, oil, transportation (mobilization & demobilization) and supplies to perform wildlife habitat improvement work in the Quartz 35 Project Area on the Seward Ranger District of the Chugach National Forest.  The work consists of tree felling, log placements, mechanical piling or mastication of felled trees and slash

The holey-sock shall have at least three segments with supporting circular framing sewn into place. Each segment shall have two pairs of 30cm diameter opposing holes, offset by 90 degrees from each other. Drogue is centered at 15 m depth. b) Inert ballast material shall be inserted into the lowest ring of the mini-drogue" of sufficient weight that a net tension of 1.5-2.0 kg will be exerted by the tether on the surface float. c) Rings made of hollow sea-water resistant, plastic tubing shall be used as the circular supporting framework for the drogue. These shall be drilled to allow flooding. d) Attachment bridle of the drogue shall consist of hub and at least 4 spokes of 0.32 diameter polypropylene-impregnated wire rope radials, positively attached and epoxy-restrained at hub to tether from surface float. Radials attach to top PVC ring using abrasion resistant cushions fixed at 90 degrees spacing. 10 cm-long rubber air hose carroting fitted where radials enter hub. Attachment point of tether to hub covered with a minimum of 15 cm long polyurethane carrot. e) The tether from the drogue to the float shall be at least 0.32 cm in diameter made of polypropylene-impregnated wire rope. There shall be no sub-surface float attached to the tether. The carrot to the clerical surface float shall be at least 15 cm long. (6.) SHIPPING CONTAINER: The shipping container should be double walled container measuring less than 43" * 43" *43" cube capable of domestic and international air, land, or sea transport. Container should allow easy access for inspection and testing of instrumentation and ARGOS telemetry system at the point of delivery. Containers and closures shall comply with the interstate 
Commerce Commission regulations, uniform Freight Classification Rules, or regulations of other carriers as applicable to the mode of transportation. Individual Drifters should be configured so that deployment from Volunteer Observing Ships can be readily done without changing the shipping configuration. The tether should be wrapped and taped with water-soluble tape around a water-soluble cardboard tube that should be left in place for deployment to prevent tangling. The drogue should be wrapped with water-soluble paper tape that should be left on the drogue upon deployment. The tape should dissolve quickly once the drifter has been deployed, allowing for an orderly release of the drogue. Instructions for deployment should be attached to the outside of each unit. Contractor shall complete a specification sheet and submit it 
to the Global Drifter Center (GDC) before a Government Bill of Lading is issued by the GDC. Specification sheets should list individual ARGOS ID of each buoy produced and provide calibration and message format information. (7.) RELIABILITY CLAUSE - Drifter transmission power should last on average a minimum of 365 days. A new "Specifications Sheet" must accompany any modification that is made if a buoy is found defective and is returned to the manufacturer for repair. Manufacturer should cover shipping costs for any returned defective drifters. Revised Specification sheets must be provided before drifting buoys are re-shipped. Specification sheets should list individual ARGOS ID of each 
buoy produced and provide calibrations and message format information. SVP SPECIFICATION SHEET (SVP3, MINI-DROGUED) VERSION MODIFIED 28 OCT 2002: ARGOS ID(s); Manufacturer; Sensor Array SVP; Surface Float Description; Tether description; Drogue description; Drogue depth; Drogue Length; Cross-sectional area above drogue; Cross-sectional area of the drogue; Transmitter type; Transmitter manufacturer; Controller manufacturer; duty cycle continuous; Message length 32 bits; Message format; Observation cycle 15 minutes; Repetition rate 90 seconds; Power Supply; Antifouling; Battery voltage sensor; Battery voltage equation; Temperature sensor type (include manufacturer and model); Temperature

<CONTACT>Kathleen M Tennant, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 286-9378, Fax (301) 286-1779, Email Kathleen.M.Tennant@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/GSFC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources for Reaction Wheels available for Spacecraft Attitude Control. SDO is the first mission under the Living with a Star (LWS) Program as part of the Sun Earth Connection (SEC).  SDO will be made up of several instruments seeking to characterize the dynamic state of the Sun and enhance our understanding of the solar process and space weather.  SDO is viewed as a follow on to the highly successful Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission. SDO will be in a circular geosynchronous orbit of ~105 degrees longitude and with an inclination of 28.5 degrees.  SDO will also have a mission life requirement of 5 years, with a possible goal of 10 years. SDO will be a three-axis stabilized satellite with jitter requirements of less than 5 arcsec.  Operations require four wheels with a per component capacity of 50 Nms/0.2 Nm (or greater) at low bus voltage of 22 V, and a capacity of 80 Nms/0.25 Nm at midrange bus voltage of 28 V.  The SDO Project is interested in possibly awarding a contract for four reaction wheels and pertinent life test data. Some fundamental information is required before the SDO project can make a determination on whether to proceed with a procurement for  the reaction wheels.  Requested information is as follows:	(1)  Momentum (Nms) and torque capacity (Nm) over the bus voltage range of 28 +/- 6V.  Momentum-torque curves for 22V, 28V, and 34 V are requested.   (2)  Flywheel inertia (kg-m2) and motor speed range (rpm). (3)  Mass (kg) and dimensions of unit (cm), for both flywheel and electronics, if packaged separately.  Drawings requested. (4)  Peak power (W) at maximum torque	(5)  Steady state power (W) at midrange speed. (6)	Steady state power (W) at maximum speed (7)  Thermal dissipation (W) during acceleration (maximum torque), for both motor and electronics, if packaged separately (8)  Thermal dissipation (W) during steady state speed, for both motor and electronics, if packaged separately (9)  Description of the electrical interface for power, command, and telemetry interface.	Please describe if/how the component interfaces with redundant vehicle electronics.  Component interface control document requested, if available. (10)  Tachometer precision (pulse/rev) (11)  Vibration and shock qualification levels (12)  Thermal qualification levels (degrees C), both operating, cold start, and survival limits requested. (13)  Estimate of electromagnetic interference (EMI) (14)  Command torque quantization (+/- Nm/cnt) (15)  Tolerance to total ionizing dose (TID) at the part level (krad) (16)  Immunity, at the parts level, to single event effects (SEE) and single event latchup (SEL) (17)  Static (g-cm) and dynamic imbalance (g-cm2) measured after vibration testing using assembled reaction wheel.  Request information on both standard and finest balance possible.  Note whether values are based on performance data, or analytical predictions.  Please note any cost/schedule implications for finest balance. (18)  Wheel disturbance force/torque data or the power spectral density of the force/torque data.   Request measurements at several discrete wheel speeds (low, midrange and maximum speed) with frequency content measured from 0 Hz to 200 Hz.  Electronic data is preferred.  Please, briefly describe the test conditions for this disturbance data. For example: Data was collected by placing a post-vibration engineering test unit on a Kistler table, spin axis aligned with gravity.  Note whether any test setup effects (data sample rate, wheel mounting fixture, disturbance from outside the test setup) add high frequency noise to the data. Note if this tested component differs from proposed component. (19)  State of component development.	A list of heritage missions using the component is requested, with specific interest in previous uses at the geostationary/geosynchronous environment. If the currently available components differ from these heritage units, please briefly describe the design changes. (20)  Component design lifetime (years), both in storage and on orbit.	Specifically interested in lubricant lifetime over five (required) to ten (possible goal) years operation.  (21)  Number of hours of failure free operations both on orbit and during life test.  Please note any operational difficulties and the mention subsequent design corrections. (22)  Typical cost and schedule for manufacturing, assembly, test and delivery. (23)  Maximum demonstrated life, on-orbit and/or during life test on ground The SDO Project encourages responses from industry sources that have expertise in providing reaction wheels.  The responses should demonstrate the technical feasibility, operational robustness and reliability. Sources with information relevant to this request are asked to describe in adequate detail the specific components that meet the above requirements.  Responses should describe the current state of the components development, past use, types of interfaces, and expected performance.  Responses should also address any modifications to existing designs necessary to meet the above requirements, and describe the qualification approach to ensure success.  Component specification and performance information is also requested. If more convenient, interested offerors/vendors are welcome to provide information by submitting separate attachments, such as interface control documents or electronic data files.  The government will protect the confidentiality of all information received that is marked proprietary.  Responses may be sent via electronic mail, regular mail, or facsimile to the technical contact listed below.  If you respond via regular mail or facsimile, please provide an electronic format in addition to the printed version of your submission. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis. Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement of 15 pages or less indicating the ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein.  In addition, interested offerors/vendors may provide any relevant catalogs or other published product literature that may be generally available in hard copy form or on-line.  There is no page limit for this information.  Interested offerors with solutions that do not meet all specifications are encouraged to respond and note exceoptions. This is especially true of existing designs where, if requirements are relieved, there are substantial savings. Responses must include the following:	name and address of firm, size of business; average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of years in business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).

<RESPDATE>090803

<DESC>NA Notice of intent to solicit on a sole source basis with Copestone Resources, LLC, 2318 North Madelyn Circle, Tucson, Arizona 85712 for extended research and development (R&D) effort on the Ammunition/Weapon Ground Truth Database to achieve conformance to t he Army transformation plan on the Integrated Test Management Framework (ITMF) migration at United States Army Yuma Proving Ground (USAYPG). It is the intent of the government to modify the completion date of contract No. DATM07-02-C-0033 from November 200 3 through April 2004. As Copestone Resources has already begun several layers and scenarios of test, simulation and validation, they possess detailed familiarity with the existing ITMF systems, interfacing military systems and equipment, it is determined t hat only Copestone can finish this effort. Upon completion of the effort, the government will possess a complete technical data package documenting the system from which to solicit any future efforts competitively. Conformance to the Army Transformation pl an requires that the current ITMF meet with the concepts outlined by Network Centric Warfare documentation. The challenge of this effort is that the interconnection of live test data with simulation and models requires that any parameter or data element re quired by the model or simulation is valid to within a specified degree of accuracy. Further, any data element provided to a model or simulation may, as a function of the model or simulation is required to be operated on by any number or type of mathematic al operation(s).  If the data element exceeds any bound of operation the model or simulation may fail. The determination of all of the data elements in relation to the performance of the model or simulation is the major component of this effort. The second  component is the location of the remaining data elements that are required to validate the data to be transmitted to the models. The input to the model and simulations is well known but the means to validate each data element in near real-time is the basi s of the problem. This continued effort is to ingest the data required to validate the data elements required by the models or simulations into the most appropriate database that is a part of the ITMF system. If this information or data element is not coll ected in an automated manner or in a manner that is not real-time enough to full fill the needs of the data transmission, then the contractor will be required to develop a monitor and/or responder or parser or any other device that is consistent with the I TMF architecture to complete the ingestion required. It is anticipated that the continuation of this effort will require an additional 4.5 months of effort. The government intends to modify the contract no later than 45 days after publication of this notic e therefore, only proposals received before the close of business on the 45th day after publication of this notice shall be considered. If your company can complete this R&D effort and produce a final technical data package: please facsimile or email your proposal describing your company qualifications, and knowledge of USAYPG ITMF systems to Becci Winkler. The small business standard SIC code 8999/NAICS 541618 ($5 million or less) applies. If you have any questions, facsimile Becci Winkler at (928) 328-684 9 or email Becci.Winkler@yuma.army.mil and please include your mailing address, point of contact, phone number, facsimile number, e-mail address and business size in your request.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. Responses to this publication are solicited to identify qualified sources. This is not a request for a formal proposal.  The anticipated NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541990 with a size standard of $6M.

This synopsis seeks to identify contractors that can provide access to longitudinal patient-level electronic medical record (EMR) data.  The data shall provide a unique resource for the study of adverse reactions to prescription medications.  The objectives are to 1) provide direct access to longitudinal, population-based EMR data, including but not limited to the following types of information at a patient level: demographic, health history, diagnoses and procedures, laboratory test results, drug and biologic utilization and administration, and health encounters (e.g. hospitalizations, specialist visits, etc.); 2) provide FDA personnel with unlimited, Internet or network-based access to these data in a multi-user environment and in real-time; and 3) provide FDA personnel with the ability to download (or obtain by other means) large datasets as needed, for the purpose of conducting epidemiological drug safety studies.

The data shall meet the need of the FDA to access patient-level, longitudinal, EMR data.  The size and characteristics of the database population as well as a comparison of the database population to the larger geographic population from which it is derived shall be provided to the FDA, since these can affect the quality and usefulness of the data.  Characteristics of the database population shall minimally include the country of origin for the database population, number of people (active and inactive) in the database, extent of geographic diversity, demographics, size of special populations of interest (including children, women of childbearing age, and elderly patients); turnover rate, and enrollment data (if applicable) for participating individuals.  The electronic medical record shall include, but not be limited to, information concerning an individual’s health status, medical history, current medical conditions and health indicators (e.g. height, weight, blood pressure, smoking status), medications, allergies, vaccination and immunization history, visit history, and visits to other specialists or inpatient facilities.

To assist FDA in achieving these objectives, a six-month, no cost trial subscription to the full, commercially available data resource shall be required.  In addition, Offerors must be able to meet the following minimum mandatory requirements: verification of the commercial availability of the data resource as of June 1, 2003; verification that the database is in English, and includes English documentation and English-language-based training and technical support; verification that the database is accessible real-time via Internet or network-based methods, as of June 1, 2003; documentation that the database has a minimum of one million active patients as of June 1, 2003; confirmation that the Offeror shall provide training and a six-month trial subscription for two individuals, at no cost to the FDA, to the full, commercially available version of the database for the purposes of evaluation.  This trial subscription shall include direct access, documentation, and technical support for the entire trial subscription period; the Offeror shall provide FDA with a description of the process for downloading (or obtaining by other means) large datasets as needed, for the purpose of conducting epidemiological drug safety studies; upon award, the Offeror shall agree to provide unlimited access to the data for FDA’s internal use without prior restraint, e.g., institutional review board (IRB) approval.  FDA acknowledges that any external release of results based on these data may be subject to mutually agreed-upon disclosure policies.

In addition, the following information shall be provided to FDA: the number of years of data available overall and in real time; the lag time between the health encounter date and online availability of the data; the mean, median, and range of observation time for patients in the database; the procedures for accessing data that are no longer online; the process for downloading datasets to be used for epidemiological investigations; and data collection and management procedures.  A complete data dictionary shall be included.

Interested parties shall submit a capability statement not to exceed 10 pages no later than August 15, 2003 to one of the following addresses:  Via U.S. Mail: Food and Drug Administration, OAGS/DSCI/HFA-505 Attn: Katharine Minker, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. Responses to this publication are solicited to identify qualified sources. This is not a request for a formal proposal.  The anticipated NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541990 with a size standard of $6M.

This synopsis seeks to identify contractors that can assist the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Office of Drug Safety (ODS) in expanding its access to medical error data resources, to complement our current adverse event databases. This data will be used by FDA staff to better assess a medical error event, both in quantitative and qualitative terms.  This effort is a response to the ongoing initiatives identified in the Quality Interagency Coordination Task Force Report (QuIC response to the IOM report) dated February 2000.  The QuIC report, in part, charged FDA with the tasks of developing standards associated with proprietary drug name confusion, labeling and packaging to prevent dosing and drug mix-ups and medication errors; and, to strengthen FDA’s overall analytical capabilities.  To assist in performing these initiatives, ODS is interested in acquiring direct access to one centralized data system integrating multiple information systems from either US hospitals, health maintenance organizations, long-term care facilities, home care, or other components of health care systems representing potential and actual medical errors.  For the purpose of this requirement, medical errors include, but are not limited to, medication errors, laboratory errors, surgical errors, and/or device errors. 

The FDA intends to use Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) data in addition to these data to strengthen our internal safety analysis on medical errors.  This analysis may lead to a regulatory action with a pharmaceutical or device company.  The ability of FDA to respond expeditiously to the increasing number of critical issues associated with medical errors is of paramount importance to the overall public safety.  The addition of these data would complement and strengthen the utility of the voluntary and mandatory reporting systems currently in place. Access to these data will increase FDA’s capability to perform regulatory impact studies to better understand and improve standards for medical product naming, labeling, packaging, and design.

Program Research Goals: 

Provide direct access to a medical error data resource with the capability of providing root cause and trend analysis.
Provide FDA personnel with unlimited, Internet access to these data in a multi-user environment and in real-time.
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to retrieve reports that are driven by certain selection parameters (e.g. health system setting, product name, product specific information [strength, dosage form, etc.] date of error, type and cause of the error, and patient outcome). 
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to query and obtain aggregate reports for the purpose of conducting medical error evaluations.  
Provide FDA personnel with the ability to broadcast global safety messages to the health system users of the medical error database for the purpose of seeking reports for certain adverse events that have been previously identified by FDA (item is desirable but not required).

To assist FDA in achieving these objectives, a two-month, no cost trial subscription to the full, commercially available data resource shall be required.

Interested parties shall submit a capability statement not to exceed 10 pages no later than August 15, 2003 to one of the following addresses:  Via U.S. Mail: Food and Drug Administration, OAGS/DSCI/HFA-505 Attn: Katharine Minker, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.  
Via FedEx or Other Delivery Service: Food and Drug Administration, OAGS/DSCI/HFA-505 Attn: Katharine Minker, 5630 Fishers Lane, Room 2121,  Rockville, MD 20852.

This is a Request for Information (RFI) for a phone bridging system to bridge a dedicated desk phone number with a cellular phone number.  Responses are due to this RFI by 4:00 PM on September 1, 2003.  See Section 7.0 for further information.


2.0	DESCRIPTION
The General Services Administration, Federal Technology Service (FTS) is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and deployment of a special bridge network in support of their mission.  

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information for conceptual technical architecture alternatives: 
(A)	Technical feasibility alternatives assessments;
(B)	Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, estimates, etc.) for alternatives;
(C)	Schedule estimates; and
(D)	Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing a phone bridge system.


3.0	DESIRED CAPABILITIES
This section enumerates the high-level functional capabilities for the bridge system.   

(A)	System to be able bridge incoming calls to ring simultaneously at both a desk phone number and a cellular phone number regardless of the cellular carrier. 

(B)	System to be able to support between 550 and 600 users but with the capability to expand.   

(C)	Ability to maintain a single one voice mail box for each user is desired (using current voice mail system).

<DESC>This is a re-issuance of SOL NTIS-RFI-03-0012.  Any company that submitted a proposal in response to our synopsis dated June 1, 2003, need not submit a new proposal, but if you do, any new information will be reviewed.    

The National Technical Information Service (NTIS), an agency at the Department of Commerce, Technology Administration, is authorized to enter into joint ventures pursuant to Section 3704b(a)(1)(A) of Title 15 of the United States Code. NTIS is looking for a joint venture partner with whom it can establish a framework for digitizing and managing federally produced audio-visual, multimedia and training collections/assets.  Once digitized, collections must be made searchable with enhanced features, such as visual and textual search capabilities and must be offered to the general public in various formats. Revenue will be derived either from the sale of such materials directly to the public or from digitizing and asset management services to be offered to other federal agencies. Currently, NTIS has approximately 6,000 masters in its collection in various formats, including digital BCSP video, BCSP video, 1 inch video, 3 /4 inch video, VHS video, video discs, CD-ROM, diskettes, 35mm slides, audiocassettes, and electronic and hard copy texts. The masters include approximately 5,200 videos, 100 slides, 150 CD-ROMs, 25 Diskettes, 100 audiocassettes and 425 text masters.  NTIS receives approximately 200 new masters each fiscal year.  None of the masters have been digitized. NTIS will 1) conduct an active outreach program to encourage other federal agencies to use the services of the joint venture partnership to digitize, index and web-enable their own media assets and make it available to the public or their constituents through NTIS.  The partner will assist NTIS in developing a Multimedia Asset Management demo to be used for this purpose; 2) conduct an active outreach program to acquire new products into the NTIS/NAC collection and transfer these new mastering materials to the partner; 3) provide bibliographic control of all audio-visual, multimedia and training material covered by this agreement; infrastructure and maintenance for web-based applications and distribution; technical support with respect to logging, indexing and setting up applicable programs; complete project management in regard to services for other federal agencies; marketing expertise geared towards increasing agency services and public sale revenues and customer service expertise in regard to customer product and billing inquiries.  NTIS' partner must 1) provide a secure space that will be dedicated solely to storing any mastering materials transferred to it by NTIS or on NTIS' behalf and existing NTIS stock for public sale dissemination upon demand. This space must be controlled for air temperature and humidity; 2) coordinate and execute the transfer of materials, at its expense, from the Washington, DC metro area locations that NTIS identifies. This transfer includes all current and incoming audio-visual, multimedia and training mastering materials and existing stock in NTIS' National Audiovisual Center (NAC) collection. Masters and existing stock previously stored in approximately 600 square feet of space. The partner will provide a schedule that will be negotiated before any of the collection is transferred. The partners agree that all mastering materials and elements provided or created will remain the property of the United States Government and may not be disposed of or destroyed without prior NTIS written consent; 3) digitize mastering materials, at its expense, making them searchable, viewable and web-enabled. The media may be produced in various formats such as videocassette, audiocassette, CD-ROM, diskette, 35mm slide, PowerPoint slide/overheads, DVD, text, multimedia training packages or other formats as the parties may agree upon. Some of the other formats include digitizing, logging and indexing media content; providing analog and digital recording and playback devices for capturing images and sound to disk and other formats, and providing hardware and software to digitize, index, catalogue, retrieve and review video clips (i.e., providing search capability) through a web browser; 4) return all masters to either NTIS or the source agency that produced the product; 5) retain control of the digitized master unless instructed otherwise by NTIS; and 6) reproduce and disseminate NTIS/NAC public sale orders on an on-demand basis.  The partners will negotiate an agreement by which they will share the revenue from the sales of products to the public or digitizing/asset management services to federal agencies on a monthly basis as described above. Revenues from these services will be determined based on the nature of the service and the work that will be performed by each party.  NTIS and the partner will jointly determine all prices for the sale of new products covered by this Agreement based on a mutually agreeable formula and consultation on any items that are outside the formula. NTIS will accept and process sales orders and refer them to the partner for fulfillment in the format requested by the customer. To facilitate this, NTIS will develop an automated interface to link NTIS and the partner. Upon order fulfillment, the partner will provide NTIS with confirmation via the interface. The partner will replace, at its own expense, any product that is unusable, broken, incomplete or that otherwise fails to operate properly. NTIS proposes the joint venture to remain in place for a period of five (5) years unless the parties agree to renew the agreement.  Presentations may be made at the request of NTIS.  Any such presentation must cover all aspects of this RFI. A revenue sharing agreement will be a result of this partnership to provide returns to the successful party.  Anticipated revenue streams must be addressed in the response.  The solution provided by the partner(s) will enable the partnership to provide a customized integrated solution to NTIS for use by federal agencies.  NTIS will evaluate responses based on criteria listed above. Prospective partners are required to describe and reference the technical capabilities of their services, describe their technical expertise and provide a concise description of their experience and ability to provide these services to NTIS and other government agencies.  NTIS has for more than fifty years fulfilled its mission of acquiring and disseminating information obtained from both government and private sector sources worldwide in response to the needs of government agencies, and the general public. NTIS is also responsible for implementing new methods or media for disseminating information, including producing and disseminating information products in electronic format. NTIS operates a clearinghouse for the information it collects, delivering bibliographic databases, and content selected by consumers in paper and electronic format, and also supports the fulfillment needs of users for the delivery of historic or archived materials produced in print-on-demand paper, demand microform or CD-ROM, or via on-line electronic access.  All communications must be completed via email.  Telephone inquiries will not be answered.  If you have any questions about these activities, please send them via email to jplott@ntis.gov AND jhendrickson@ntis.gov, or by facsimile to (703) 605-6888.  Offerors should limit their proposal to twenty-five (25) typewritten pages, excluding graphic appendices.  Offerors must provide one (1) original and four (4) hard copies of their proposal to Jennifer Hendrickson, Office of Business Development at the above address by the response date specified in this announcement.   All proposals must be received by 12:00 Noon on August 8, 2003.

<SUBJECT>D -- Automated Information Management System (Military Awards)
<DESC>The purpose of this Sources Sought Request is to obtain immediate responses for an IT System that has to be put into place immediately due to Operations Enduring Freedom/Iraqi Freedom.  
C.1   BACKGROUND

The Director of Navy Staff (DNS) Command Information Officer (CIO), in support of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), administers, executes, or supports OPNAV command-wide information processes, coordinates common Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) & CNO information processes, and provides policy, executive oversight or project execution of CNO information projects or initiatives within the context of knowledge work.   There is tremendous concern that as we begin to process awards from the "War in Iraq" the current awards system will fail resulting in valuable lost personnel data.  
The current awards system is a single, authoritative source of awards information for the U.S. Navy and USMC from WWII to present. There are over 2.0 million records of Navy Personal Awards and Unit Awards information.  Technical management expertise is nonexistent due to the age of the system.  This system is hosted on an outdated SECNAV VAX server that is perilously close to the end of its service life.  Current applications are laborious due to manual in-put of data.  New applications will automate the award business processes that are now mostly paper-based. Additionally, the new awards system will link to BUPERS.

C.2.   SCOPE AND OBJECTIVE

OPNAV CIO has an urgent requirement to develop a new Awards Information Management System (AIMS).   The contractor shall provide support necessary to facilitate attainment of this objective

C.3   TASKS

The contractor shall be required to support the following initiatives through project planning and coordination, research, analysis and assessment of alternatives, development of draft reports, briefs, plans, and/or related materials, facilitation of communications within the community commands, coordination of community efforts, facilitation and/or support of community meetings and other efforts.

C.3.1     Task 1 – Provide Project Management Support

 Project management support shall be provided for the transformation of the SECNAV/OPNAV Awards Information Management System (AIMS) to a service-based set of processes to ensure the stability and preservation of awards information and the establishment of a future enterprise-wide awards process or processes.  Support shall be provided to the SECNAV awards action officers, OPNAV CIO, CNO Awards office, the e-Business program office, and the Naval command awards administration stakeholders. 
 
Other tasks shall be assigned to advance OPNAV CIO information or project management objectives.



 In order to accomplish above, OPNAV CIO needs the help of  contractor support to document Naval (Navy & Marine) personnel award processes at various echelon levels and provide overall project management and supervision of  IT application development.  

OPNAV CIO routinely performs the following types of tasks in meeting this responsibility.
•	Project coordination, planning, and tactical execution of OPNAV CIO projects or initiatives
•	Provision of subject matter expertise (SME) to support Joint, Naval, and Navy-wide information processes
•	Research, analysis, and assessment of information and knowledge management (KM) processes, technologies and/or capabilities
•	Operate and sustain Navy information infrastructure or systems
•	Collaborate with other services or Naval command components for the advance of joint initiatives or projects.
The contractor shall be capable of providing support to DNS in performing these, as well as, other types of tasks necessary to advance Joint or Naval knowledge management capabilities.

C.3.2    Task 2 – Prepare Monthly Status Report

The contractor shall deliver a Monthly Status Report (MSR) in the format shown in Section J, and on the schedule defined in Section F.  The MSR shall include the significant events and milestones for the previous calendar month.

C.3.3     Task 3 – Prepare Reports or Plans

The contractor shall submit reports as directed by OPNAC CIO on a schedule jointly agreed upon and appropriate to the scope of the task assigned by OPNAV CIO.

C.3.4     Prepare Draft Briefing Material

The contractor shall submit draft briefing material as directed by OPNAV CIO on a schedule jointly agreed upon and appropriate to the scope of the task assigned by OPNAV CIO.
M.1  		BASIS FOR AWARD

Offerors will be selected on the basis of their proposal being the most advantageous to the Government.  In the evaluation, Key Personnel will be more important than Past Performance, which will be significantly more important than the Technical Approach.  Within the categories of Key Personnel and Past Performance, specific experience with AIMS will be given a higher relative weighting, than ‘similar’ experience.

M.2  		COST PROPOSAL EVALUATION

Offerors' quotes will be evaluated to determine reasonableness and realism. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options (if any)  to the total price for the basic requirement.  Evaluation of the options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

M.3		TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA

The Government will evaluate technical proposals based on the factors shown below.

•	Past Performance 
•	Technical Approach
•	Personnel
NOTE:  Please submit your response via email to Linda Clay at linda.clay@gsa.gov or via fax (703) 306-7718.

<DESC>The Government desires to solicit comments to the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) provided under this synopsis.  All comments and requested information are to be submitted via electronic mail, and are due by 4:00 PM on 08 August 2003.  It is requested that interested parties provide business size of company.  Telephone and facsimile responses to this synopsis will not be accepted.  On 17 July 2000, the Department of the Navy announced the Administrative Support Services function as a candidate for a Commercial Activities study in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76.  The intent of the study is to determine the most efficient and cost effective method of providing Administrative Support Services for the Fleet Technical Support Center, Atlantic (FTSCLANT).  FTSCLANT headquarters is in Norfolk, VA. with detachments in Mayport, FL; New London, CT; Ingleside, TX; and Naples, IT.  Unless specifically stated otherwise in this PWS, the personnel/employees that provide Administrative Support Services will perform all such duties in (FTSCLANT) Norfolk, VA. and (FTSCLANT Mayport Detachment) Mayport, FL. Limiting conditions for this acquisition include the need for the Service Provider to be fully capable to provide Administrative Support Services in the following areas (a) Processing Documents (PD), (b) Scheduling Support Services (SS), (c) Office Operations Support Services (OO), (d) Reception Support Services (RS), (e) Mail Distribution Services (MD), (f) Training Services (TS), (g) Media Services (MS), and (h) Command Community Outreach (CO).  Accordingly, the Service Provider must be capable of gaining access to all facilities requiring support, to include the ability to obtain all necessary security clearances.  The offeror determined to represent the best value to the Government will be compared to the Government’s proposal to perform the Administrative Support Services.  The Government intends to negotiate a Firm-Fixed Price contract.  The resulting contract will be for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods.  NAICS 541611 SIC Code 8742 applies.  Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.neco.navy.mil or at http://www2.eps.gov.
