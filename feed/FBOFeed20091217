<DESC>COMMON VERTICAL LIFT SUPPORT PLATFORM (CVLSP)Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request For Information (CRFI)
INTRODUCTIONThe Air Force is planning to acquire a Common Vertical Lift Support Platform (CVLSP) to replace the current USAF UH-1N fleet.  It is anticipated the USAF fleet of 62 UH-1Ns will all be replaced, with possibly up to 93 air vehicles.  The Air Force is considering an incremental acquisition approach.  The first increment is anticipated to be a production contract beginning in FY12.  To assist in this effort, the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Capabilities Planning Division (ASC/XRX), Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (SSS/CRFI) to obtain market insight into potential solutions and sources capable of providing at least 16 aircraft no later than 30 September 2017.  Additionally, at least six of those aircraft with sufficient training and other support (initial spares, support equipment, data, etc.) to operate those aircraft are required to declare Initial Operational Capability (IOC) no later than 30 Septe! mber 2015.
CVLSP is expected to be an in-production, non-developmental, Government Off-The-Shelf or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (GOTS/COTS) solution.  Meeting schedule is critical and we will consider some performance trade-offs to meet schedule at an affordable cost.  If the solution cannot meet all the capabilities, describe the capabilities your solution can meet if a production decision is made in FY12 and describe the cost and schedule needed to meet all the capabilities.  If a respondent has more than one solution to discuss, a separate response for each is desired.  Respondents must describe their solutions' compatibility and comparability to the given capabilities, rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimates, delivery schedules, and other market information of potential solutions. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this SSS/CRFI.  This SSS/CRFI is part of ongoing Government conducted market research for planning purposes.  It is NOT a solicitation.  The Government will not provide reimbursement for costs associated with this request.  Responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.  The submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the US Government and will not be returned.  Such information will be reviewed by a team comprised of Government as well as contractor personnel hired to provide technical assistance for the Government's preparation of an acquisition strategy.  All members of the team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required by the Economic Espionage Act, 18 U.S.C. 1831 et seq., and other applicable statutes or regulat! ions.  In addition, Government members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905.  All contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts.  The Government has also determined that their contractor team members have no organizational conflicts of interest that could adversely affect protection of the information.  The Government will not reply to information received.  The Government may conduct follow-on discussions with responders through individual one-on-one and/or collective "industry day" sessions.
PURPOSE The purpose of this SSS/CRFI is (1) to engage industry early in the effort, (2) to identify sources that can provide an Off-The-Shelf (OTS) capability if a go-ahead production decision is made in FY12, and (3) to assist the Air Force in ascertaining schedule, cost and technical risk associated with acquisition of the CVLSP capability.  The information respondents submit may be used to develop an acquisition strategy.  The information in this SSS/CRFI is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to any formal release of an RFP. 
RESPONSE GUIDANCEInformation received as a result of this request will be considered sensitive and will be protected as such.  Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that 'publicly-releasable' and 'proprietary' information are clearly distinguished.  Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure.  The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one responder to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition. 
SSS/CRFI responses should include a: 1.	Cover page containing identification of the company Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, street address, and business size for NACICS code 336411 (aircraft manufacturing) and the names and telephone numbers of the technical Point of Contact (POC) and the overall company POC (in the case of a partnership, please provide appropriate CAGE codes and POC information for the lead company).2.	Responses are limited to 30 pages and must be received by 22 January 2010.  Responses must be submitted via e-mail with a CD copy by regular mail in text searchable Portable Document Format (.pdf). Responses should be sent to ASC/XRX, (Antony Susainathan,antony.susainathan@wpafb.af.mil) and to the Contracting Officer, Betty Clingerman, 303 AESW/XR, Betty.Clingerman@wpafb.af.mil, 2275 D Street, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH  45433-7017. 
CVLSP BACKGROUNDThe UH-1N helicopters to be replaced by the CVLSP are employed by various USAF organizations to accomplish a wide range of missions.  The primary mission operation will be in the CONUS, Midwest northern-tier states (e.g., ND, MT, WY), and Washington DC.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACTING ACTION (NOCA) This Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) announcement constitutes a Notice of Contracting Action (NOCA), by the 551st Electronics Systems Group, Hanscom AFB, MA.   The Government intends to issue a contract to Northrop Grumman Corporation, Baltimore, MD, pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) entitled "One Responsible Source And No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements"; FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) is authorized under 10 U.S.C. 2304-(c)1.This Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Sole Source service acquisition is in support of The Kingdom of the Royal Saudi Arabia Air Force (RSAF) fleet of AWACS Aircraft.  The specific requirement is for the following:  Three (3) Radar Technicians (an engineer, a quality assurance/control inspector, and a radar shop technician) to provide in-country technical services, sustainment and support of the E-3 AWACS (pre-RSIP baseline) AN/APY-2 radar system; this is an immediate requirement to prepare for the RSIP installation and check-out (I&CO) Program. This radar system is integrated into the Boeing RSAF E3 (AWACS) fleet.  The proposed services will be provided at the Prince Sultan Air Base (PSAB), Saudi Arabia for a period of thirty-six (36) months.  These services will require personnel to have a minimum of 10 years experience in evaluating and troubleshooting AN/APY-2 radar maintenance problems and must be able to perform repairs on system components, document system repairs and mod! ifications, and advise and train Royal Saudi Air Force personnel.  To perform the required services, the contractor will be responsible to provide trained US Citizens with appropriate Secret Security Clearances to perform these tasks.  Northrop Grumman Corporation, Baltimore, MD (formerly Westinghouse Corporation) owns the radar proprietary data and is the designer and original manufacturer of the AWACS radar.  The Government has determined that an award to any source other than Northrop Grumman would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Governments requirements.  This notice is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  In addition, this notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.    Please direct any questions concerning this notice to the attention of David H.

<DESC>THERE ARE NO FUNDS AGAINST THE BAA SOLICITATION. The U.S. Air Force Electronic Systems Center's Improvised Explosive Device Defeat (IEDD) program Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) identifies scientific and technical areas of interest for the acquisition of basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. This BAA is conducted using full and open competition. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this BAA is presumed to be 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. Although no portion of this BAA has been set aside for small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, historically underutilized business zone businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and/or minority institutions, participation from all these organizations is highly encouraged. In an effort to minimize proposal preparation cost, this BAA utilizes a two-step process. The first step will be the submission of a concept paper. Offerors that submit concept papers that are consistent with the intent of the BAA, and are of interest to the government will be invited to submit a proposal (step two). Such an invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Instructions for the submission of concept papers and proposals are contained in the BAA. The submission of a concept paper is required prior to the submission of a proposal. Failure to follow this two-step process may preclude the chance for award. Proposals submitted in response to the BAA will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation criteria set forth in the BAA. Technical evaluations will employ a peer or scientific review process. A proposal's technical evaluation, and its importance to agency programs, along with funding availability are primary bases for contract award. Cost reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate. Concept papers will be accepted continuously through 31 December 2010. This BAA will remain open continuously through 31 January 2011. The BAA technical areas of interest are for research work to develop and demonstrate technologies to improve virtually all aspects of performance related to next generation IEDD equipment in the areas of prediction, prevention, and detection of explosive threats. All questions may be directed to the technical contact points listed in Section V of the BAA.

<DESC>Procurement Request Number: ____502-10-1-084-0003____________________________      	LSJ Number: ____LSJ502-10-001_________________________________LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION FOR FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE PROGRAMUpon the basis of the following justification, I, as  _Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of sources limited to fewer than those required in FAR 8.405-1, FAR 8.405-2 pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 251 as implemented by  FAR 8.405-6 (b) (1.1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity and specific identification of the document as a limited source justification (LSJ).Alexandria, Louisiana VA Medical Center Contracting Office for use by Pharmacy Service in providing patient care.2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.VAMC Alexandria is in need of purchasing an AutoMed FastPak EXP that will allow us to maintain our current high level of accuracy and service utilizing the most advanced interface barcode packaging system. Currently the Alexandria VAMC has an AutoMed FastPak 330 and it is time for an upgrade to the new hardware since the support for our current hardware will expire on 12/31/2009. The new hardware will utilize our current drug file information and interface which is in place, is stable and supported. 3.	A complete description of the supplies and/or services required to meet the agency's needsThe AutoMed FastPak EXP system will include the Packaging Unit, Replenishment Kit, Includes Implementation Fees and System Interface Fee. The total cost of this contract is $184,000.00. If purchased by the end of this month, the system may be deliverable by February 2010. 4.	An identification of the LSJ rationale, and if applicable, a demonstration of the contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service."	FAR 8.405-6 (b) (1) - Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work;"	FAR 8.405-6(b)(3) - An urgent or compelling need exists, and following the FSS ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delaysThe Alexandria VAMC has determined that no other company's hardware could utilize our existing interface, replenishment station or Vista option that have proven to be so stable and accurate. The suggested manufacturer is the only company that manufacturers the equipment in question. As such, it is the only company that can continually update the equipment with computerized updates as they become available. These updates keep the equipment current with the latest technology and greatly enhances the pharmacies ability to administer the necessary care to the patient. This new hardware is considered an upgrade to the overall unit dose operating system and replenishment station that we currently have in place. Automed is offering a trade in for our existing hardware (FastPak 330) which will allow us to get the newer version EXP model.5.	A determination by the ordering activity Contracting Officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404(d).Pricing has been determined fair and reasonable by GSA.  Pricing will be taken from published price list on the Federal Supply Schedule.6.	A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders, and the results of the research, or a statement why market research was not conducted.  A statement must be made that the supplies and services are available from the FSS. To describe the Market Research that was conducted for this service, several different things were looked at in detail. First, was the historical acquisition learned from the research. There is a fair amount of historical inpatient automated purchases at this medical center; it was also found that other medical centers throughout VISN 16 have the same equipment. Through these sources, it was learned that this should be handled as a Limited Source because of the proprietary information the company has for its own equipment and the replacement criticality of a significant piece of automation hardware to the unit dose packaging system. Also, it talking with Pharmacy, Bio-med personnel and other knowledgeable people; it was learned that the equipment went out of warranty and a new service contract is unavailable past 12/31/2009. Updated hardware is needed to be eligible for an on-going Service Contract to be in place to assist our Bio-med personnel in the event the repair was beyond their capabilities. Reviewing internet resources did not turn up much information. The Market Research did determine that the requirement could be met by using commercial format because the service needed is customary with commercial industry practices and needs mo modifications to accommodate the Government's requirements.7.	Any other facts supporting the limited source justification. The Alexandria VAMC has determined that no other company's hardware could utilize our existing interface, replenishment station or Vista option that have proven to be so stable and accurate. The suggested manufacturer is the only company that manufacturers the equipment in question. As such, it is the only company that can continually update the equipment with computerized updates as they become available. These updates keep the equipment current with the latest technology and greatly enhances the pharmacies ability to administer the necessary care to the patient. This new hardware is considered an upgrade to the overall unit dose operating system and replenishment station that we currently have in place. Automed is offering a trade in for our existing hardware (FastPak 330) which will allow us to get the newer version EXP model.8.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency will take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for supplies and services is made.Pharmacy staff will keep abreast of market and at the end of the life span will conduct market research to determine if unrestricted consideration can be made  before acquisition of the supplies. 9.	The ordering activity Contracting Officer's certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer's knowledge and belief and evidence that the supporting data that  form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by technical/program personnel.CertificationAcquisition Initiator:                                       I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance, which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification, are complete and accurate. ___________//ES//________________    	______12/4/2009_____________            Paul D.

Because ELORET possesses unique expertise inmeeting the requirements of NASA Ames Research Center, no alternate source couldadequately provide this support during this brief extension period.The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intendsto solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Thepurpose of this action is to bridge the performance period between the end of the currentcontract and the anticipated award of the follow-on contract. Market research has beenperformed and the procurement process for the follow-on contract has commenced underNNA09274979r-NCV. The follow-on contract has been solicited on a competitive smallbusiness set-aside basis.It is the intent of the Government to award this action on a sole source basis. Award toanother source at the same time the recompete is in process would result in substantialduplication of costs and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Governments requirements.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice issolely within the discretion of the Government. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested parties may submit their capabilities andqualifications to perform the effort IN WRITING to the identified point of contact notlater than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 5, 2010.

This is a market survey for FAA initial and recurrent pilot training for the following types of aircrafts: LearJet 60, Hawker Beechcraft 300 Super King Air with EFIS Avionics, Challenger CL-601-3R1, CL-604, and CL-605.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing FAA initial and recurrent pilot training for the following types of aircrafts: LearJet 60, Hawker Beechcraft 300 Super King Air with EFIS Avionics, Challenger CL-601-3R1, CL-604, and CL-605.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 611512, Flight Training with a size standard of 25.5M.   
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:        Type of services provided by your firm,         Size and type of services provided by   previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance),         Number of years in business
2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services 
3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses.  
Attached is a draft of the statement of work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments. 
All responses to this market survey must be received by January 22rd, 2009 at 3:00pm CST.   All submittals should be submitted to:

This is a market survey for FAA initial and recurrent pilot training for the following type of aircraft: Hawker Beechcraft 300 Super King Air with Pro Line 21 Avionics.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing FAA initial and recurrent pilot training for the following type of aircraft: Hawker Beechcraft 300 Super King Air with Pro Line 21 Avionics.
This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 611512, Flight Training with a size standard of 25.5M.   
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:a. Type of services provided by your firm, b. Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance), c. Number of years in business
2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services 
3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses.  
Attached is a draft of the performance work statement (PWS).  Respondents are encouraged to review the performance work statement and provide comments. 
All responses to this market survey must be received by January 22nd, 2009 at 3:00pm CST.   All submittals should be submitted to:

<DESC>THIS IS AN EMANDEMENT TO THE PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE ISSUED FOR BAA 10-CANSCAN
The Department of the Interior, National Business Center, (DOI/NBC) on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security, Science and Technology Directorate (DHS S&T) is issuing this DRAFT Broad Agency Announcement (BAA)  for innovative Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) and Automated Threat Recognition (ATR) Technologies for use by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).  Both CBP and TSA have a need to improve technologies currently being deployed for inspecting incoming vehicles, cargo conveyances, and air-cargo shipments.  Current NII technologies employed by CBP and TSA include (1) trace material detection of highly specific molecules using technologies such as canine teams or chemical analysis of surface swipes and 'puffs' of air, and (2) imaging inspection using technologies primarily based on X-ray and gamma-ray systems.  Imaging systems inherently have lower material specificity than molecular detection systems.  This BAA focuses entirely on imaging-based technologies, which allow a detailed inspection of vehicles as well as interiors of large cargo and air shipping containers.  Adversaries may use hidden compartments or other methods of concealment to smuggle contraband across the US border.  The ultimate goal of this effort is to provide CBP and TSA with improved NII technologies for enhanced screening, examination, and detection of contraband, hidden compartments, materials for weapons of mass destruction/mass effect, and human stowaways.  To achieve this goal these new NII systems will have improved penetration, resolution, contrast sensitivity, and throughput, as well as automated material identification capability.  This BAA 10-CanScan constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.  No further solicitation regarding this notice will be issued.  The closing date for this BAA is February 16, 2010.
Important: 	December 17: Pre-release issued 	January 4, 2010: Full Solicitation issued	January 4, 2010 through February 17, 2010: Proposals Submitted and  Accepted 	February 17, 2010:  Deadline for Submission of proposals is 4:30 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time (EST)
Contact with Technical Point of Contact:  Please note that contact with the Technical Point of Contact is allowed up to January 4, 2010.
The entire BAA is available at http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/solicitations.
NAICS Code: 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Live Sciences.
No questions concerning this BAA will be accepted by telephone.

<DESC><p>Zeiss Discovery V12 stereo microscope upgrade to high resolution fluorescence imaging.</p>
<p>Our Cascade Microtech probe station for life sciences includes a basic microscopy capability (the Zeiss Discovery V12) as well as integrated micro fluidic probes that allow for simultaneous fluid connection and electrical connection to a micro fluidic chip. In order to image one micrometer sized objects the Zeiss microscope magnification must be increased. In order to detect molecular fuctionalization of these objects fluorescence capability must be added to the Zeiss microscope. The probe station came with the basic model Zeiss Discovery V12 microscope for biological imaging with a low resolution objective and without florescence capabilities and we need to buy Zeiss components for the Discovery V12 to affect the upgrade.</p>
<p>Required Zeiss components:</p>
<p>Note: Relevant Ziess brochures are included for reference.</p>
<p>1) Flouresence upgrade: A fluorescence imaging upgrade for a Zeiss Discovery V12 microscope including a UV light source, filter cube holder, FITC filters cube, and a reflecting cube for visible light. Fluorescence stereomicroscopy means visualizing specific fluorochromes and fluorescent proteins, working with large object fields and high resolution. With the "PentaFluar" S, the Stereo Discovery can be equipped for many fluorescence applications. The Zeiss parts and part numbers are listed below.</p>

Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, NPS will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor.  Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap.  This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s).  Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the NPS will continue to acquire such specialized services. 
TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA
Statements of Qualification will be evaluated by a selection committee of National Park Service personnel based upon the following primary criteria, listed in descending order of importance:

<CONTACT>Christine Ngo 301-319-4056 Technical POC: Denver TerranceTelephone #: 301-295-2926
<DESC>**This posting is for Information Purposes Only**
This contract action is for Design/Build RFP development of the Multipurpose Parking Garage for which the Government intends to procure a sole source with HSMM/HOK JV, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
The HSMM/HOK A/E team was selected through a highly competitive process that included a national search for qualified designers, and selection based upon the winning design.  HSMM/HOK has been involved from the onset of the project and conducted all of the initial site investigations, generated the 35% design drawings, and developed the original DB RFP for construction.  The original RFP for the Staff Parking Garage (SPG) was awarded to CBB as an option, however the Government did not exercise the option due to a lack of funding.  Now that funding has been identified, a revised RFP is required.  Minor requirements changes have evolved in the interim and must be incorporated into the revision.  Due to their long-term involvement with the project, the HSMM/HOK team has intimate knowledge of the original intent of the parking garage, and can easily translate these changes to refine and repackage the original RFP to meet the Government's current needs.  Aside from the change in title from SPG to Multi-Use Parking Garage (MPG), the primary change requires relocating and repositioning the structure within the site.  The HSMM/HOK team understands the complexities associated with this change, which include extensive underground utility relocation and coordination with a separate contractor to simultaneously construct three unrelated structures housed in very close proximity.

<DESC><p>NAICS Code: 921110 The United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105 intends to award a purchase order under FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisition Procedures) to the City of Mountain View, CA. This order is for environmental and legal services in relation to the Record of Decision of the groundwater remedy for the Middlefield-Ellis-Whisman (MEW) Superfund Study Area in Mountain View, CA to address the subsurface vapor intrusion pathway.</p>
<p>The justification is as follows: The City of Mountain View and its property owners, and tenants are significant stakeholders of EPA's proposed remedy for the vapor intrusion pathway at the MEW site in Mountain View, and Moffett Field, California. EPA anticipates relying on the City to help implement and provide the mechanism to monitor the institutional controls for the vapor intrusion remedy and therefore, it is imperative that the City be actively involved in the process.</p>
<p>The estimated period of performance is from 01/04/10 to 03/31/11. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) AND NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification, including the name and telephone number of a point of contact, to the Contract Specialist listed in the announcement. The U.S. Geological Survey, Research Lab, Lawrence, Kansas, has a requirement for supplies from Abraxis LLC, Atrazine, Cylindrospermopsin ELISA, Saxitoxin ELISA, Ethylnylestradiol (EE2) IME2, Estrone (E1) IMEI, 17B-Estradiol, Sulfamethoxazole for one year. Abraxis LLC will receive orders from designated government employees for the chemicals identified above over the performance period of one year Not to Exceed 40,000.00.
Based on the information available at this time and in accordance with 41 USC 253(c)(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the government considers the supplies specified as a sole source from Abraxis LLC, Warminster, PA and proposes to negotiate a contract with that company on the following basis. Abraxis kits offer the unique qualification to fill the requirement of the USGS, Lawrence, Kansas, because of data continuity for existing projects, compatability with existing validated methodology, acceptable quality control/quality assurance, and comparability with existing USGS approved and research chromatographic methods. Additionally, our staff is fully trained on these methods and the interpretation of provided data. Our laboratory staff would have to be retrained and alternate ELISAs would have to be revalidated against existing chromatographic methods at significant cost to the USGS Kansas Water Science Center and lead to diminished sample throughput during the validation process. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered . Firms who feel they can furnish the required supplies or its functional equivalent (based on the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit, in writing, an affirmative response to this announcement. An affirmative response would include literature brochures, and other such materials which correspond to the required supplies stated herein. This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, No solicitation documents exists. Therefore, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration. This notice may represent the government's only official notice of this procurement.

<p>12. Description: The Space and Missile Systems Center, Space Development and Test Wing, Launch Test Squadron (LTS), Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, NM, is contemplating multiple awards of a seven-year delivery order Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a combination of Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Firm Fixed Price, and Fixed Price Incentive Fee delivery orders for missions that encompass a wide range of small launch missions detailed below in Mission Scenarios 1-3. The purpose of this program will be to provide enhanced capability and flexibility in the development of small launch vehicles and launch services using mature vehicle designs and any combination of commercial and Government Furnished Property (GFP) motors to meet a variety of mission and payload requirements. The Government is requesting interested firms to submit a written Statement of Capability (SOC) expressing their desire and ability to meet the Small Launch Vehicle objectives to this office.<br />Background: LTS is looking for launch service providers and, while the launch vehicle itself is an important part of the requirement, the ability to modify a vehicle with the addition of stages, greater volume fairing, alternate launch locations, reduced launch call up times, and other mission-enabling capabilities are equally important. LTS requires a multitude of small launch capabilities to support the following mission types:<br />Mission 1 - Small Satellite: Mission 1 covers small spacecraft/satellites that range from 500 lbs to 6,000 lbs in mass to a Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Additional orbits of interest include, but are not limited to, higher energy orbits such as Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Highly Elliptical Orbits (HEO). Potential missions will include single satellite insertions as well as multiple payloads. Responses should include discussion on the company's capability to support multiple payload deployments. Mission timelines will be from 3+ years to 12 months for nominal missions. The contract will have provisions to support operationally responsive space missions.<br />Mission 2 - Sub-Orbital Launch: LTS supports government agencies with sub-orbital missions that may either be simply the booster itself, re-entry vehicles, or experiments. This mission type may be either air or ground launched, liquid or solid, and may require launch from austere locations. Target missions will be sub-orbital in nature.<br />Mission 3 - Test Launch: LTS supports a number of launches that are neither targets nor space launch. These missions may be to demonstrate new technologies, unique items, and other unique R&amp;D activities. It is difficult to define the capabilities needed for these launches prior to an experimental or R&amp;D mission being defined. The interested firm should discuss their ability to develop a launch system, either from a modified configuration or from the ground up, based on the mission requirements. Prospective firms need to discuss their ability and knowledge of launching from any launch range and the ability to meet range safety requirements.</p>
<p>For each mission type the contractor will be required to develop the launch vehicle, including, but not limited to, development of guidance and control systems, mission and targeting software, flight termination systems, providing the launch service, and performing post-launch analysis. The contractor will develop, procure, and build flight hardware, and integrate and launch the mission from any of several ranges.</p>
<p>The contract ordering period will be for seven years and will require flexibility in responding to unique technical requirements, vehicle quantity, and schedule changes. Depending on the mission, the government may provide the following GFP: payload, launch facilities, solid booster motors (deactivated Minuteman and Peacekeeper ICBM rocket motors), payload isolation systems, separation systems, re-entry vehicles, decoys, and launch vehicle transportation hardware. The Statements of Capability shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing these areas: (A) Experience: an outline of previous projects, specific work previously performed or being performed, and any in-house research and development effort relevant to the specific task areas of this effort, (B) Personnel: professional qualifications and specific experience of scientific, engineering and program management personnel who might be assigned to work in areas of the subject effort, and (C) Facilities: availability and description of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration, and a statement regarding industrial security clearance and storage facilities to support work at the SECRET level.</p>
<p>The responses provided for Experience, Personnel, and Facilities above should contain information demonstrating the ability to meet the following technical requirements for each of the three specific mission types the contractor is interested in pursuing. The technical requirements are:<br />(1) Mission Design: Ability to design launch vehicle(s) using commercial and GFP motors meeting all technical, mission, and safety requirements. This includes the ability to (a) design launch vehicle(s) that are either flight proven, derived from a flight proven design(s) or, for new configurations, maximize the use of flight heritage components and systems and other efforts that minimizes mission risk; (b) incorporate different test range ground and flight safety requirements into the design of the launch vehicle systems; (c) integrate a payload (designed and provided by an independent contractor or as GFP) to the launch vehicle; and (d) design, develop, and test the vehicle to include guidance and control hardware and software and attitude control systems capable of meeting mission requirements.<br />(2) Mission Planning: Ability to perform a range of mission planning, targeting, and data analysis efforts. This includes the ability to (a) provide mission planning and targeting of the proposed launch vehicle(s); (b) coordinate mission parameters with outside agencies by providing trajectory data and vehicle characterization; (c) perform post-mission analysis of booster telemetry and ground sensor data.<br />(3) Launch Vehicle Fabrication and Test: Ability to fabricate and test the necessary components, and assemble the launch vehicle. This includes the ability to (a) manufacture and test attitude control hardware capable of performing required maneuvers; (b) fabricate, modify, integrate, and test guidance and control systems; (c) provide facilities, tooling, support and test equipment for both hardware and software, which the contractor will maintain and utilize for testing, manufacturing, integration and analysis; (d) test hardware for vibration, shock, humidity and temperature for both individual components and integrated systems; (e) provide facilities to safely test individual components and integrated systems; (f) safely transport hardware, including motors and pyrotechnic devices; (g) obtain access to a manufacturing and testing facility with facility clearance at the SECRET/ NOFORN level.<br />(4) Launch Vehicle Assembly and Test: Ability to plan and perform flight test operations from any government or commercially owned launch range to include air launch capability. This includes: (a) planning launches from the range in accordance with relevant ground and flight safety requirements and mission requirements; (b) integrating and servicing boosters and payload using existing or contractor furnished storage, missile assembly and integration and operations facilities.<br />(5) Program Management: Ability to provide program management activities, integrating systems engineering and other activities. This includes: (a) interfacing with payload contractors, government agencies, and range safety offices; (b) efficiently integrating systems engineering disciplines such as configuration management, reliability, quality assurance, safety, manufacturing, etc; (c) facilities and procedures for hosting SECRET / NOFORN meetings.</p>
<p>All potential sources are encouraged to respond to one or more of the 3 missions. The SOC(s) will be rejected unless all the above technical requirements are addressed for each mission type. The SOC must be received by Release + four weeks. Each SOC is limited to 25 pages per configuration, excluding resumes. All replies to this synopsis must refer to the reference number (12) above.

The US Army is considering issue of a Request for Proposals (RFP) for procurement of  the Monocular Night Vision Device (MNVD)  AN/PVS-14 and Night Vision Goggle (NVG) AN/PVS-7, associated spare parts (including 18mm Third Generation image intensifier tubes), and purge devices for these devices.  The Army has placed an increased priority on its entire night vision capability in order to be able to operate as well at night as in the day.  In order to satisfy this priority, it is critical that the night vision systems necessary to achieve this capability be procured.<BR><BR>System Description:<BR>The AN/PVS-7 is a NVG incorporating a single third generation image intensifier which uses prisms and lenses to provide the user with simulated binocular vision.  The NVG incorporates a high light protection circuit in a passive, self-contained image intensifier device which amplifies existing ambient light to provide the operator a means of conducting night operations.  The NVG is a hand-held, head-mounted, or helmet-mounted night vision system that enables walking, driving, weapon firing, short-range surveillance, map reading, vehicle maintenance, and administering first aid in both moonlight and starlight.  The housing assembly incorporates infrared (IR) light source which provides illumination to permit close-in-viewing.  <BR><BR>The AN/PVS-14 is a lightweight, third generation, multi-purpose, night vision monocular device incorporating a third generation image intensifier with similar key features found in the AN/PVS-7.  The MNVD is used in observation and command and control, and is intended for use during starlight and moonlight conditions, for walking, driving, weapon firing, short-range surveillance, map reading, vehicle maintenance, and administering medical aid.  The system is a self-contained unit operating with one AA battery and features manual gain control adjustment by the operator to meet various brightness conditions.  The MNVD is capable of being hand-held, mounted to a small arms (M16/M4) weapons mounting rail, a head-mount adapter, or helmet-mount adapter.  The MNVD incorporates an infrared (IR) light source that provides illumination, when required, for close-up viewing such as map reading and field medical assistance.  The objective and eyepiece assemblies allow attachment of similar accessories and the head/helmet mount adapter is the same.  An eyepiece diopter adjustment capability is provided so the MNVD can be worn without corrective eyeglasses.<BR><BR>The minimum performance requirements for these devices and components are expected to be the performance requirements of the OMNIBUS VII contract W9124Q-05-D-0821 and W9124Q-05-D-0823.  It is anticipated that a draft RFP will be issued on or about 11 Jan 2010, Final RFP on or about 1 Feb 2010, with proposals due on or about 1 Mar 2010, and award approximately 30 May 2010.  The anticipated acquisition strategy for the award is as follows:  (1) full and open competition; (2) two firm-fixed price awards made on a best-value basis; (3) Contract will be a three year Indefinite Dollar/Indefinite Quantity (ID / IQ) contract.  The minimum quantity is anticipated to be approximately 1,000 AN/PVS-14 MNVDs.  The contract will also include anticipated maximum potential quantities of: 36,020 AN/PVS-7Ds, 126,020 AN/PVS-14 MNVDs, 52,360 MX-11769 image intensifiers, 16,765 MX-10130 image intensifiers, associated spare parts for each referenced system, and purge device.  This is not a request for proposal.  For additional information, contact Tyrone Knight, Contracting Officer, RDECOM Acquisition Center, (410) 278-2465.

Description

The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify and obtain information from responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the electric distribution (NAICS 221122), water distribution (NAICS 221310), and wastewater collection (NAICS 221320) utility systems at Columbus Air Force Base (AFB), Mississippi.    Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. §2688 – Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the electric, water, and wastewater utility systems at Columbus AFB, Mississippi, and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter “Notice”) is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.  Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 3:00 pm EDT on Friday, May 29, 2009.  Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:  (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).  The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Government’s use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the July 2009 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.  

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office.

Installation Description

The electric distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

The primary distribution circuits are both overhead on utility poles and underground in conduit. The distribution system is constructed primarily in a radial configuration with provisions for crossties between circuits and within its own circuit, which allows operational flexibility for maintenance and outage considerations. There are no substations and  no switching stations, but there are some pad-mounted switches. There is one 15 kV class switchgear lineup located at the Flight Simulator Building, B268, which selects the primary feed from the dedicated Flight Simulator Circuit, 214, and an alternate feed. The switchgear consists of two 15 kV fused switches to select the primary feed and six fused switches feeding the six 750 kVA power transformers feeding the Flight Simulator Building.  Other major system components include pad-mounted switches, transformers, utility poles, utility manholes, and meters.  The meters are transformer rated electromechanical and transformer electronic. The base employs a mix of overhead pole mounted distribution transformers, three-phase and single-phase pad-mounted distribution transformers and four sets of pad-mounted aerial distribution transformers. The average depth for buried components is 3’ – 4’ and approximately 10% of the ductbank and conduit is beneath paved surfaces.  Specifically excluded from the electric distribution system privatization are: Airfield Lighting, Emergency Power Generators, Parking lots and pedestrian pathway lighting fed off the building internal source, Water tower beacon lights, Military Family Housing, Shuqualak Auxiliary Field, Greenwood Springs Next Generation Site, Munitions Storage Area (MSA), and the Energy Management Control System (EMCs). 

The water distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

The complete water distribution system consists of buried piping ranging in size from ¾-inch service lines to the 16-inch water main at depths from 3 to 14 feet, an average depth of 6 feet.  The water mains and service lines are oversized cast iron (CI), transite (asbestos cement or AC), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or polyethylene (PE) pipe installed anytime from the 1940s to 2007.  Plastic pipe installed within the last decade, or planned to be installed in the near future, is installed with tracer wire.  There are more than 900 service connections base wide.  Approximately 5% of the distribution system mains and roughly 10% of lateral lines lie under paved surfaces.  All gate valves are contained in valve boxes and are exercised regularly.  The system pressure ranges from 60 to 66 pounds per square inch (psi).  The water quality is regulated by the Mississippi State Department of Health under Public Water System (PWS) No. 0440018 and is tested quarterly.  All fire hydrants and fire lines are connected to the potable water distribution system.  Many hydrants have been replaced over the years and are exercised regularly.  All base irrigation comes from potable water, but is also regulated with backflow prevention (BFP).  The Whispering Pines Golf Course irrigation system is operated by golf course services and is not being transferred.  The contractor will install new secondary meters on the outlet side of each BFP separating the golf course irrigation system from the main distribution system and the new PODs will be the outlet side of the new meters  The Magnolia, State and Capitol Village Military Family Housing (MFH) areas were privatized in October of 2007.  The water distribution systems within military family housing are owned by Pinnacle Hunt Company and PODs for the utility have been established for transition of ownership.  Ten buildings with 20 housing units within Capitol Village Housing remain the property of Columbus AFB as Temporary Living Facilities (TLF).  The inlet of the laterals from the main to the outlet of the residential meters at these houses is owned by CAFB.  Ownership of the existing meters and laterals are to be transferred to the contractor.  Specifically excluded from the water distribution system privatization are: Shuqualak Auxiliary Field, Greenwood Springs, Military Family Housing, Irrigation systems, Non-potable fire systems, Supplementary Water Wells, 10,000 Gallon Elevated Water Storage Tank (near MSA), Water Tower Lights, Energy Management Control System.

The wastewater collection system being privatized is described as follows: 

Columbus AFB wastewater is collected throughout the base using service laterals, gravity mains, and force mains. A force main from the main base passes through manhole #63, where an eight inch pipe then carries it to the discharge point. The discharge point lies approximately 200 feet west of the Columbus AFB south gate. The Columbus Light and Water Department (CL&W) then collects the discharge from the installation and treats the wastewater.  A majority of the existing concrete pipe is dated more than 50 years old; however Insituform® (cured-in-place), was inserted in 2000 to preserve the existing system. Currently, the system consists of vitrified clay, concrete with Insituform® concrete, asbestos cement, cast iron, and a few segments of PVC. No tracer wire, marker tape, industrial waste collection system, wastewater treatment plant, or cathodic protection is present on the installation. Pipe size ranges from 4 inches to 12 inches. The system’s average burial depth ranges from 3 to 14 feet, with an average burial depth of 8.5 feet deep. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the pipes are beneath paved surfaces.  There are a total of ten lift stations: four main lift stations tied to the force mains, and six smaller lift stations servicing other areas of the base. All three housing areas were privatized in 2007; therefore components in these areas are not being transferred. However, the force main leading from the Capitol Village Housing area to manhole #63 is included in this inventory.  Specifically excluded from the wastewater distribution system privatization are: Shuqualak Auxiliary Field, Military Family Housing, Greenwood Springs, Grease Traps, Oil / Water Separators (OWS), Septic Tanks, Leach Fields, Grit Chambers, and Energy Management Control System (EMCS).

<DESC>NASA/LaRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources to support theCLARREO Infrared (IR) Instrument Integrated Product Team (IPT). The following is a draftversion of the Statement of Work.1.0	BackgroundThe Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory Mission (CLARREO) is aclimate-focused mission.  The foundation for CLARREO is its ability to produceirrefutable climate records through the use of exacting on-board traceability of theinstrument accuracy to international measurement standards.  Current satellite-based sensors are not designed to meet the accuracy requirementsnecessary for climate measurements.  Many sensors used for climate measurements weredesigned to meet operational weather needs and were not specifically designed to meet thedemanding calibration accuracies required for climate measurement.  The CLARREO missionis intended to meet climate needs through careful consideration of the instrument design,calibration traceability at all stages of development, calibration and verificationtraceability on-orbit and spectral, spatial, and temporal sampling focused specificallyon the creation of accurate, long-term climate data records.CLARREOs instrument suite is planned to include one or more spectrometers that willconduct measurements in the infrared spectrum.	Infrared measurement requirements areprovided in Attachment 1 for reference.  Due to CLARREOs stringent requirements onmeasurement accuracy, calibration, and traceability, NASA is forming an IntegratedProduct Team (IPT) to ensure that the requisite expertise and capabilities fromGovernment, industry and academia are available to contribute to the systems engineering,design, analysis, development and characterization of the instrument systems andcomponents used by CLARREO to conduct the infrared measurements.2.0	Scope and ObjectiveThe NASA Langley Research Center is seeking support for a CLARREO Integrated Product Team(IPT) to provide instrument systems expertise and capabilities for conductingmeasurements in the infrared spectrum, in accordance with 3.0 Task Requirements.

Note that these requirementsare under review by NASA and may be revised at a later date.	Spectral Coverage:  3.6 to 50 micrometers or equivalently, 2760 to 200wavenumbers	Spectral Resolution:  0.5 wavenumbers, unapodized	Interferogram Type:  Symmetric (sometimes referred to as double sided)	Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV):  &gt;=25 km from a 609 km orbit 	Temporal Sampling:  Record 1 complete, interferogram in less than 10 seconds. 	Pointing:  Image motion compensation required	Measurement Accuracy:The main CLARREO data product is calibrated radiance spectra expressed in Watts persquare meter per steradian per wavenumber (W m-2 sr-1 cm-1).  To obtain the accuracyneeded to detect and attribute climate change, stringent requirements are placed uponsystematic and random errors in the CLARREO instruments. The accuracy is defined as theroot-sum-square of the systematic and random errors in the calibrated radiance spectra.The combined magnitude of all systematic errors, both correlated and uncorrelated, shallnot exceed 5.1 x 10-5 (W m-2 sr-1 cm-1) over the 200 to 2760 wavenumber range for asingle spectrum 3-sigma. This corresponds to an equivalent brightness temperature errorof 0.1 Kelvin at 1000 wavenumbers for a 220 Kelvin scene temperature.The random measurement error shall not exceed 5.1 x 10-4 (W m-2 sr-1 cm-1) over the 200to 2760 wavenumber range for a single spectrum 3-sigma. This corresponds to an equivalentbrightness temperature error of 1.0 Kelvin at 1000 wavenumbers for a 220 Kelvin scenetemperature.  It is envisioned that the CLARREO accuracy requirement is to be achieved bytaking long-term (~monthly) averages in which the random noise will be reducedeffectively to zero by the averaging of many spectra.The resulting awards are anticipated to be task order contracts and NASA anticipatesmaking multiple awards. The contracts will contain the Limitation of Future Contractingclause with restrictions on competing for design and fabrication of flight hardwareassociated with the Infrared Electro-optical Instrument. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sitesfor the release of any solicitation or synopsis.Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet theabove requirement should submit a capability statement of 5 pages or less indicating theability to perform the effort described herein.Responses must include the following:  name and address of firm, size of business;average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; whether theyare large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and/or woman-owned; number of yearsin business; affiliate information:  parent company, joint venture partners, potentialteaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potentialprime); list of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant workperformed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; and pointof contact - address and phone number).

<DESC>This is the public notice for acquisitions over $10,000.
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), located at MacDill AFB, FL intends to issue a fixed price purchase order to Rockwell Collins, Cedar Rapids, IA for 1 ea. WXR-700C C-Band Radar Dual R/T Mount Part No. 622-5124-101 under the General Services Administration (GSA) federal schedule contract No. GS-35-F-5926H.</p>
<p>The NOAA AOC operates two WP-3D aircraft and a Gulfstream GIV. These aircraft are complex flying laboratories used to support hurricane research, surveillance, and reconnaissance, and other initiatives in the areas of global change, atmospheric and ocean research programs. The nose Radar subsystem (Model WXR-700C) for the above aircraft is critical for the safety of flight for all projects. A third WP-3D aircraft is being delivered and needs to be outfitted with the same nose radar subsystem to ensure form, fit, and function. The proposed acquisition is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FASA of 1994 (Title VIII PL 103-355) as implemented by FAR 12.102 &amp; 13.106-1(b). ERAD intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis with Rockwell Collins based on the following reasons: 1) Rockwell Collins designed and manufactured the radar used in the AOC, P-3 aircraft; 2) the radar unit must meet exact form, fit, and function and be the exact part number specified; 3) using the same radar fulfills an element of the ICAP initiative to standardize the reporting capabilities and equipment of all NOAA aircraft; 4) Rockwell Collins is the only company that manufactures the WXR-700C C-Band radar. All NOAA aircraft must have the same equipment installed.</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit offers. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses. However, all responses received within fifteen (15) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Responses can be faxed to Ron Anielak at (816) 274-6951 or sent via email to Ronald.f.anielak@noaa.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All responsible business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Interested firms shall include, in writing, the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications to manufacture the specified equipment; and sufficient information that describes or demonstrates the firm's technical capability to provide the specified equipment in form, fit, and functionality. Only affirmative responses to this notice will be evaluated to the extent necessary for the Government to determine whether it is feasible to conduct a competitive acquisition considering spare parts, cost of testing, standardization, consistency, training, and price. Submissions received in response to this notice shall be evaluated based on demonstrated technical ability to successfully provide the required equipment as stated herein.</p>
<p>DOC, ERAD requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No purchase order can be made to a company not registered in CCR.

<DESC>The Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, located in Monterey, California, (Fleet Numerical) collects, interprets, and applies global atmospheric and oceanographic data and information in support of strategic and tactical warfare and peace-keeping initiatives. Fleet Numerical is the Department of Defense's (DoD) principal operational processing center for automated numerical meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) analyses and predictions. Fleet Numerical provides around-the-clock operational oceanographic and meteorological support. Fleet Numerical consists of supercomputer systems that run the numerical atmospheric/oceanographic models and other systems, including clusters, which provide data communications, pre- and post- processing, derived applications and web services.
Historically, High Performance Computing (HPC) has been the backbone of the Analysis and Modeling Subsystem (AMS). AMS was decoupled from the Applications, Transactions and Observations (ATOS) layer of the infrastructure due to constraints in the state of computing. Advances in computing architectures now allow the consolidation of AMS and ATOS into a common architecture, i.e., A2. The attached performance work statement (PWS) provides a framework of the tasks to be performed: technical engineering and system design support for a variety of system architecture tasks, including computer systems, disk subsystems, networks, archive subsystems, security, information assurance and overall end-to-end systems design to achieve a consolidated architecture.
The goal of A2 transition is to consolidate the AMS and ATOS into a common architecture. The Government requires services for systems engineering, design, and technology investigation tasks to adopt and integrate new technology into Fleet Numerical's operational workflow. Services are also required to provide engineering support expertise and architect services required to ensure the transition to A2 equipment. This implementation will provide for improvement of all current operational subsystems at Fleet Numerical. It will also ensure adequate evaluation of potential future systems and the planning of their transition into Fleet Numerical's current and future operational architecture, when and where appropriate.
The purpose of this request for information is to seek information on companies and personnel with capabilities to meet the requirements in the attached Performance Work Statement and questionnaire.
Vendor should identify if the applicable services are available via GSA schedules and / or some other existing contractual vehicle; please provide schedule and / or contract number.

<DESC>1.0 OBJECTIVE &amp; SCOPE<br /><br />1.1 Objective of the RFI: Detect and Localize PNT Interference; Intentional and Unintentional Interference<br /><br />The Department of Homeland Security is conducting market research on sensors capable of detecting and localizing PNT interference, whether intentional or unintentional, with intent to cause harm or to disrupt normal everyday operations of the 18 critical infrastructure and key resource (CIKR) sectors. Additional information on the 18 CIKR sectors may be found here: http://www.dhs.gov/files/programs/gc_1189168948944.shtm.<br />For the purposes of this RFI, interference to PNT systems can be broadly split into 2 distinct categories, unintentional or intentional. Intentional interference is described as deliberate attempts to jam, meacon or spoof GPS receivers. <br />Jamming is the generation of Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) of a sufficient power and frequency spectrum to dilute or mask a desired signal. The weakness of the GPS signal level means that even very low-powered jammers will deny GPS reception at significant distances; rendering the task of locating such devices very challenging in certain environments. <br />Meaconing involves receiving a broadcast signal and then re-broadcasting it with a delay, which results in significant errors in the derived PNT solutions. Repeaters or re-radiators have been available on the open market for commercial use until recent enforcement action from the FCC.<br />Spoofing is related to meaconing and is a similar threat to the accuracy of GPS, but the false signal is developed independently of the actual GPS signal and is a variable false signal. Spoofing can theoretically create unlimited errors in position or timing services and hence, increases the potential for confusion and damage, while being increasingly more complex in execution.
<p>1.2 INTRODUCTION<br /><br />As part of its ongoing mission to align information technology investments and improve geospatial service delivery across the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Geospatial Management Office (GMO), under the direction of the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO) is investigating the development of Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) Interference Detection and Mitigation (IDM) technologies which will serve the broad needs of the DHS, its component agencies and other departments and agencies of the Federal government. The objective of this request for information (RFI) is to solicit information on innovative and efficient concepts and technologies that would provide the GMO with insight into the current "state of the art" of technologies that could be integrated into a Space-Based PNT IDM from a system perspective. The information collected from this RFI will help to establish a common framework from which to plan for enterprise PNT IDM solutions that the DHS will develop and field in the future.</p>
<p>1.3 BACKGROUND<br /><br />Geospatial Management Office of the Department of Homeland Security <br />The GMO works in a technical advisory capacity to maximize the DHS return on geospatial technology investments, strengthen cross-mission information sharing, and assists DHS component programs in developing collaborative technology that supports their mission domain while conforming to interoperable standards and the IT policies of the Department. With this mission in mind, the GMO develops solutions architectures for the Department and its components. As part of this architecture development, the GMO has identified the need for a centralized Space-Based PNT IDM service that leverages existing federal infrastructure and that can offer the scalability and agility to meet the diverse needs of the Department's enforcement, preparedness, response, and recovery mission areas.</p>
<p>U.S. Space-Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing Policy<br />On December 8, 2004, the President of the United States authorized a new national policy which established guidance and implementation actions for space-based positioning, navigation, and timing programs, augmentations, and activities for U.S. national and homeland security, civil, scientific, and commercial purposes. The unclassified fact sheet of December 15, 2004 for the U.S. SPACE-BASED POSITIONING, NAVIGATION, AND TIMING POLICY detailed new and challenging PNT responsibilities for the Secretary of Homeland Security that included: <br />"In coordination with the Secretaries of Transportation and Defense, and in cooperation with other Departments and Agencies, coordinate the use of existing and planned Federal capabilities to identify, locate, and attribute any interference within the United States that adversely affects use of the Global Positioning System and its augmentations for homeland security, civil, commercial, and scientific purposes;"<br />Although other responsibilities are detailed in the Fact Sheet, this RFI focuses solely on the one above. The complete 15 Dec 2004 Fact Sheet can be obtained at: http://pnt.gov/policy/2004-policy.shtml<br />For purposes of this RFI, the Federal GPS augmentations include, but not limited to:</p>
<p>a) Nationwide Differential GPS (NDGPS), as managed by the DHS/USCG.<br />b) Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) as managed by the DOT/FAA. <br />c) Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) as managed by the DOT/FAA.</p>
<p>DHS Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Interference Detection and Mitigation Plan. <br />The DHS Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) Interference Detection and Mitigation (IDM) Plan was developed as the result of tasking from the United States (U.S.) Space-Based PNT Policy of December 8, 2004. The policy established responsibilities for multiple departments and agencies within the Federal government, to better plan, manage and protect PNT services, and assigned the DHS specific responsibilities governing the protection of PNT services within the critical infrastructure (CI). The IDM Plan detailed the DHS's initial response to the Policy implementation action and lays the foundation for further planning and actions necessary to meet the Presidential Policy responsibilities. The IDM Plan was approved by the President on August 20, 2007 and is classified For Official Use Only (FOUO). <br />The publicly released April 2008 PNT IDM Plan Fact Sheet can be obtained at:<br />http://pnt.gov/public/docs/2008/idmfactsheet.pdf<br />A more comprehensive PNT IDM Plan Summary from April 2008 that was publicly released can be obtained at:<br />http://pnt.gov/public/docs/2008/idmpublicsummary.pdf<br />The PNT IDM Plan provides the framework and guidance necessary for the DHS to execute responsibilities required by the PNT policy. It establishes the foundation for additional planning and actions necessary to meet national PNT policy responsibilities. The plan promotes improved coordination, cooperation, and information exchange among government agencies enabling prioritized responses to incidents using the best available resources. The IDM plan advocates methodologies, practices and solutions for improved national response capabilities. Space-based PNT services are integral to the technological foundation of the civil and commercial worldwide infrastructure. <br />This RFI is in direct response to the PNT policy and the PNT IDM Plan in order determine technologies that can directly support DHS responsibilities to detect, localize and mitigate sources of interference to Space-Based PNT systems and their augmentations.<br />For additional U.S. government PNT information, including public policy and other documents, visit: http://www.pnt.gov</p>
<p><br />1.4 CURRENT STATE OF OPERATIONS<br /><br />The use of GPS for PNT related services and information is relied upon by a large variety of systems and applications within the critical infrastructure. This reliance has led to the need to monitor the availability and integrity of civil services. Over the past years, GPS performance and interference reporting procedures have been developed and are currently provided by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Navigation Center (NAVCEN), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Operations Control Center (NOCC) and the U.S. Strategic Command GPS Operations Center (GPSOC). These three core organizations collect and disseminate GPS related information providing complementary reporting, investigation status and interference mitigation efforts that deal with enquiries and issues from both military and civil users alike. The differing needs of the users from these three core organizations are reflected by the requirements for information that had led in turn to the development of a variety of un-standardized plans and procedures for GPS interference and anomaly reporting. The IDM Plan leverages all the existing government capabilities, procedures and plans to strengthen interagency cooperation and response to both intentional and unintentional interference in the event of a significant national incident or for routine reports of anomalies and outages. The major goals are the detection and reporting of the anomaly or interference, investigation status, coordination of information, assessment of the impact and the application of mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center General Capabilities<br />The USCG NAVCEN is the primary interface to all civil non-aviation users of GPS. The NAVCEN Navigation Information Service (NIS) has established and maintains a continuous point of contact (POC) that provides a capability for question or issue resolution regarding GPS anomalies and interference reporting, to support maritime and land users with prioritized approach for safety-of-life applications. A web-based software application provides GPS and USCG augmentation systems status information services. The USCG also provides an impact assessment on the Nationwide Differential GPS (NDGPS) during scheduled and unscheduled GPS outages for analysis and comparison. The NAVCEN will process all GPS user reports of outages, anomalies and signal degradation, including aviation users, and routinely forward interference reports to the GPSOC or the FAA NOCC, as appropriate. The overall intent is the resolution and dissemination of information, providing feedback to the users as to why service was interrupted. If an outage event is associated with maritime users, the GPS outage can be verified by the utilization of Coast Guard ships and assets. In addition, the NDGPS system also provides remote monitoring of the GPS signal (an inherent sensor for GPS signal quality) that can indicate problems or GPS outages in the vicinity of the NDGPS stations. This capability provides corroboration of interference and the recognition of significant events without extensive implementation of new systems. To better understand the impact of GPS interference, the USCG regularly participates in DoD Navwar tests and evaluation exercises to evaluate the impact on maritime operations from GPS denial and interference. The flow of information through the NAVCEN upon receipt of an interference report, provides information to either the FAA NOCC or GPSOC dependent on the source of the report and its potential disruption. Any aviation related outages are forwarded to the FAA NOCC for further investigation due to the safety-of-life considerations and associated responsibilities. Information is forwarded to the GPSOC to determine constellation status and impact of satellite outages or problems. The final resolution of a report is concluded by either the restoration of GPS services or the provision of an explanation of the cause of an anomaly.</p>
<p>Federal Aviation Administration National Operations Control Center General Capabilities<br />Responsibility is allocated to the FAA for the management and resolution of all aviation reported interference. Due to the safety-of-life considerations, the FAA has well-defined procedures for dealing with the notification and coordination of any interference reports from aviation users, which includes the processing of National Airspace System (NAS) interference reports and specifically, GPS interference reports. The procedures capture the actions necessary to record a detailed interference report; identify whether the reported interference is from an approved Federal-Electronic Attack (EA) test event; coordinate a response; determine the credibility of an anomaly; distribute notification; investigate and locate sources; and coordinate mitigation to minimize as quickly as possible impact on other aviation users. Procedures have been developed to provide timely accurate information to the NOCC, where further investigation, analysis, coordination and assessment of impact will begin. The NOCC will identify all pre-coordinated or pre-approved GPS EA and testing. If the anomaly is reported within the airspace confines of Federally approved (by NTIA or DoD) GPS EA or test operation, the anomaly is not considered interference. These events are considered approved and aviators/mariners are notified, as required, via Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) or Notice to Mariners (NOTMAR). If the anomaly report is outside an approved GPS EA or test operation, the FAA-DoD Liaison, in coordination with the NTIA, will further attempt to identify the interference source. While the FAA DoD Liaison and NTIA verifications are ongoing, appropriate FAA spectrum personnel will research the NTIA Government Master File (GMF) database. The FAA-DoD Liaison or NTIA may contact the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Communications and Crisis Management Center (CCMC) if necessary to resolve the case of interference. Once the validity of an event is determined, the incident is logged in the FAA's Event Manager and is then subject to further investigation, status suspense timelines, as well as being a mandatory briefing item to senior management until resolution. The anomaly is further examined internally to determine the cause and extent of the impact on other NAS users and augmentation Systems, before being notified to other agencies. The NAVCEN and GPSOC are principal organizations contacted by the NOCC once internal coordination is complete and an anomaly is verified.</p>
<p>U.S. Strategic Command GPS Operations Center General Capabilities<br />The GPSOC is the DoD primary point of contact for information regarding status of GPS Precise Positioning Service (PPS) and GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS), including accuracy and availability; predictive coverage/accuracy information; GPS performance history; assistance in analyzing GPS data; and generation of information to supplement reports covering analysis and findings of outages and signal degradation. The GPSOC is the focal point for the Joint Functional Component Command for Space (JFCC SPACE), to provide electromagnetic interference (EMI) assistance to DoD. The GPSOC is the interface with the USCG NAVCEN and FAA NOCC, and has the responsibility for responding to inquiries and providing information regarding the GPS constellation and the existence of space segment anomalies or issues that could result in GPS outages worldwide. The GPSOC monitors and provides data regarding PPS anomalies and interference on a worldwide basis. The GPSOC is tasked to maintain and provide limited access to a central database of GPS anomalies. The GPSOC accepts GPS SPS and/or PPS problem reports from the NOCC or NAVCEN to assist in the resolution of outages. Per the GPS Operations Center Concept of Operations (CONOPS), the GPSOC overarching mission is to operate, maintain, and employ GPS to produce a desired effect in support of military, civil and allied operations across the full spectrum of conflict. One of the key aspects of this effects-based concept is to provide interference detection, location and mitigation assistance. Inter-organization information is distributed by means of e-mail and web access, and accommodates both planned and unscheduled outages and anomalies. Predicted geographical impact of interference can be modeled using the GPS Interference and Analysis Tool (GIANT) application, to analyze and predict areas of interference coverage. The quality of input data to the model is essential to accurately predict coverage impact and is reliant on measured assessments of interference type, location, power and altitude.</p>
<p>Current Architecture Overview<br />Current reporting procedures, investigation efforts and mitigation capabilities were developed and designed to provide a manageable system of inter-organizational cooperation and utilization of existing assets and capabilities. The current procedures meet the initial requirements for the intended objectives of notification and information distribution, concerning interference to civil users of GPS. The services provide a means to allow reporting of incidents or anomalies, investigation of the event and feedback to the user of why service was disrupted. If significant impacts are noted, further investigation and mitigation of the interference source is conducted appropriately. Each organization has distinct roles as previously defined, and plays a defined part in the resolution of such anomalies. The current plans and procedures re-route information to the organization best placed or chartered to investigate and respond. Communications is by email and phone call and there is not centralized common system for managing interference events. Response time is in the nature of days or sometimes weeks to resolve an interference event.</p>
<p>Capability Development and Improvement<br />The U.S. Space-Based PNT Policy guidance gives clear direction as to what capabilities are desired to protect the use of PNT services for homeland security and other civil applications. The PNT IDM plan considers how capabilities can be improved to best complement and build on the existing Federal architecture and infrastructure. It is recognized that the realization of improved capability is subject to inter-department and inter-agency cooperation necessary to concur on the path to capability enhancement, inter-departmental agreements and funding allocations.</p>

<DESC>IAW FAR 52.215-3 Request for Information (Oct 1997)<BR>a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal cost, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.<BR>b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.<BR>c)This solicitation is issued for the purpose of:<BR>The U.S. Army Program Executive Office (PEO) Simulation Training and Instrumentation (STRI) has established a Live Training Transformation (LT2) product line approach to developing a Family of Training Systems (FTS) that provide the ground maneuver training range functions supporting Army live and Joint training environments. The success of the LT2 program strategy is dependent on defining standards and initiatives derived to promote systematic reuse of software and interoperability solutions for the LT2 products. <BR>Application of LT2 product line standards have matured, thus reducing life cycle development and sustainment costs through the creation of common reusable architectures, which provide integrated and interoperable training solutions for the LT2-FTS deployable to Army ranges. LT2 standard initiatives cover the following primary areas of technology development: Tactical Engagement Simulation System (TESS), training instrumentation systems, software architecture, targetry and battlefield effects, and Joint Live-Virtual-Constructive interoperability. Approved and established standards include Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA), OneTESS, Family of Army Systems and Integrated Targetry (FASIT), Integrated Player Unit (IPU), Common Player Unit (CPU) Interface Control Document (ICD), Graphical User Interface (GUI) Framework, and LT2 Human-Computer Interface (HCI) Style guide. <BR>The LT2 standards provide industry the appropriate development guidelines and interface definitions in order to maximize industry involvement in developing product line solutions and providing advanced training capabilities through technology insertion. Government and industry work together to establish the LT2 standard initiatives based on common use cases and detail the relevant solution sets resulting in achievement of the PEO STRI mission and the LT2 product line interoperability and reuse objectives.<BR>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice only. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is seeking to conduct Vendor Demonstrations pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10: Market Research. Full requirements will not be provided. No solicitation will be issued. <br /><br />This Sources Sought Notice is intended to provide the USCG with follow-on Market Research. Please reference RFI HSCG23-09-I-2DW265 posted at: <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a> open to the public for response from 28 May 2009 to 19 June 2009. <br /><br />The Coast Guard Logistics Information Management System (CG-LIMS) Acquisition Project will require a centrally managed, integrated, enterprise-wide logistics information management system to support USCG assets and their associated systems and equipment. This system will serve as the enterprise logistical support tool for aircraft, cutters, boats, C4ISR systems, and shore facilities. The USCG objective is to acquire a logistics system that will leverage industry standards and best practices to increase efficiency, optimize effectiveness, and establish common processes for managing logistics across the enterprise. The ability to maximize operational capabilities and minimize lifecycle costs are fundamental goals. CG-LIMS must be interoperable with legacy USCG and other government agencies' systems. CG-LIMS will be a feeder system to the Coast Guard's core accounting system. CG-LIMS will interface with existing and future USCG systems as they are transformed and modernized. As such, the system will need to be Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) compliant, and be scalable and flexible in meeting existing and future requirements.<br /><br />CG-LIMS software solution will use state-of-the-market, Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) tool(s) configured to meet the USCG's business requirements.<br /><br />The Coast Guard expects to acquire a system, including planning, integration, configuration, data migration, initial user training, and deployment in one solicitation. Coast Guard does not plan to solicit proposals for the COTS software selection and then the implementation services separately.<br /><br />CG-LIMS will function on the Coast Guard Data Network (CGDN+), with potential migration to DHS OneNet. It will be compatible with the USCG SOA and Enterprise Architecture (EA).

<p>&bull; Asset Configuration Management <br />&bull; Maintenance Management <br />&bull; Supply Chain Management <br />&bull; Technical Information/ Data Management<br />&bull; Financial System Interface/Integration<br />&bull; Support units with limited bandwidth or interrupted network connectivity<br />&bull; Scalability<br />&bull; Integration and Interface ease<br />&bull; Configuration ease<br />&bull; Operate on CG Standard Workstation (MS Vista OS)</p>
<p><br />All interested parties should submit a capability statement including a list of their proposed COTS software solutions to the USCG Office of Contract Operations. The capability statement should clearly explain the contractor's abilities and proposed list of COTS software solutions which directly relate to the general capabilities and requirements listed above. Respondents should include their company's business size and socioeconomic status. Proprietary information is not requested; respondents shall refrain from providing the USCG with proprietary information. Responses shall not exceed 4 pages in length (excluding a cover sheet).</p>
<p>Those companies responding with a capabilities statement and a proposed list of COTS software solutions will be invited to present their capabilities and demonstrate their solutions to the government at Vendor Demonstrations in March 2010. Questions may be addressed during the demonstration, however the Government may not respond to all specific questions or comments submitted in response to this announcement or information provided as a result of this announcement. The Government reserves the right to decline a vendor's request to demonstrate if the capabilities statement and software solutions are not clearly articulated in their submission.</p>
<p>Responses shall be received electronically via email by both Alexandra Smith at: <a href="mailto:Alexandra.L.Smith@uscg.mil">Alexandra.L.Smith@uscg.mil</a>&nbsp;and Laura Spillane at: <a href="mailto:Laura.Spillane@uscg.mil">Laura.Spillane@uscg.mil</a>. Please&nbsp;submit responses with Subject: CG-LIMS Market Research. Responses shall be received no later than 14 January 2010 at 10:00 P.M. Eastern Time. Responses received after this deadline may not be reviewed.</p>
<p>Response to this Sources Sought Notice and subsequent participation in the Vendor Demonstration Day are entirely voluntary. Vendor responses and participation will not obligate the USCG to pay, or entitle the vendor to claim any direct or indirect costs, charges, or any other remuneration whatsoever. The USCG will not pay for any costs associated with the demonstration effort. Should the USCG realize full, funded requirements, response to this Sources Sought Notice, or lack thereof, will neither advance nor hinder a vendor's prospect of contract award.</p>

<DESC><br /><br />NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE<br />The Headquarters (HQ) Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Contracting Squadron CONS/LGCI, Randolph Air Force Base (AFB) Texas 78150, hereby formally announces the intent to exercise the contract Option to Extend Services, FAR clause 52.217-8, for contract FA3002-05-D-0006, which was awarded on a sole source basis to McDonnell Douglas Corporation, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Boeing Company, St Louis MO 63166-0516. The extension period consists of 6 months, from 1 Jan 10 to 30 Jun 10.<br />Contract FA3002-05-D-0006 is for C-17 Aircrew and Mainenance Training services, Type 1 Special Training, procured by AETC and presented under the auspices of the Air Force Security Assistance Training Program (AFSAT). The training is a combination of prepared classroom studies and hands-on practical application. It includes initial and continuation training for pilots, loadmasters and maintenance technicians. The contractor will also provide special skills training, such as air-refueling, airdrop, firefighter/rescue, core-integrated processor (CIP), instructor training and incidental maintenance training. This training is being conducted at various Government Owned - Contractor Operated (GOCO) C-17 training facilities. Boeing is also under contract with ASC/YWM (C-17 Training System Product Group at Wright-Patterson AFB OH) who operates these training facilities, along with the USAF owned training devices. Under this contract, Boeing also acquires the aircrew and maintenance training devices, provides instructor and facility staff, plus maintenance services for all training devices. <br />Boeing is uniquely qualified and experienced in supplying this type of highly specialized training and training support services. Boeing is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the sole developer of the C-17 aircraft. The most capable source to continue delivering these services to current and future C-17 FMS customers is Boeing. Second, the acquisition or re-creation of C-17 technical data packages and software under contracts with other contractors would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. A re-compete would cause unacceptable delays in schedule for FMS customers. Boeing already owns the technical data packages and C-17 software. They have an experienced staff with extensive C-17 knowledge. Boeing has also provided sustained engineering for C-17 fleet support, continually updating technical data and software. Third, standardization and interoperability of C-17 flight and maintenance operations is a significant safety concern for the US government and foreign C-17 customers. This interoperable capability is contributing to the successes of on-going C-17 airlift operations in the Middle East. Providing this training via the same source, Boeing, for FMS C-17 customers would significantly increase standardization and interoperability among C-17 fleets in coalition operations and other global scenarios. <br />This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, all interested persons that identify to the Contracting Officer their intent and capabilities to satisfy the Government's requirement and are received withing 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed 6-month extension period based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. For specific questions, please contact the Contracting Officer, Ms. Germaine Miller, at germaine.miller@randolph.af.mil or telephone (210) 652-6523.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO THE USEPA REGION 5 START CONTRACTOR UNDER EP-S5-06-04. REQUESTS AND/OR INQUIRIES WILL NOT BE ADDRESSED. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE USEPA TO AWARD A TASK ORDER UNDER AN EXISTING CONTRACT. The purpose of this Task Order (TO) #17 is to obligate $60,000.00 for a Targeted Brownfield Assessment (TBA) of the Highway 52 Gun Club, City of Inver Grove Heights, County of Dakota, State of Minnesota. The period of performance will be from December 17, 2009 through June 30, 2010. Requirements for TO #17 include the following: 1) attending meeting(s) and conference calls with City, State and EPA representatives; 2) preparing a site-specific QA Project Plan (QAPP) and Health &amp; Safety Plan (HASP); 3) preparing a site-specific Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP); 4) conducting Phase II field/investigation work; <br />5) preparing the Phase II Assessment Report; 6) preparing a cleanup plan with cost estimates; 7) preparing the Property Profile Form (PPF) or entering site-specific information into EPA ACRES Database; 8) complying with the documentation and reporting requirements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ("ARRA" or "the Act") contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's START (Superfund Technical Assessment and Response Team) contracts were awarded as IDIQ contracts, they were awarded competitively with fixed rates, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the type of services to be performed. The existing START contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance and to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing START contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA. <br />

Subsequent to Tropical Storm Agnes the USACE was authorized to increase the level of protection to prevent overtopping by another Agnes event.  The levee raising project is essentially complete; however, since the raising of the levees, there have been several high river events.  During these events, excess seepage and small sand boils have been observed along various reaches of the project.  This project consists of seven sites that will require investigation to see why and where the actual problem exists, recommendations with designs on repair options, design, and construction of the selected options.  This will require extensive Geotechnical experience with relief wells and seepage berms.

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., W91278-06-C-0038<br><br>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-06-C-0038, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Black Warrior and Tombigbee Waterway and Alabama River System, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815, Hennessey, Oklahoma.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for, to add the following work to: Prepare and re-paint the superstructure and machinery on Bankhead Spillway.  This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes making necessary repairs to steel, concrete, seals, cathodic systems, and hydraulic systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated in the existing contract.  <BR> <BR>This existing contract must be used because:  1) The contractor must work in conjunction with government operated floating plant and personnel in order to set stop logs and position work barges.  2)  The contractor is already making extensive repairs on the spillway and is already re-painting the spillway gates.  It would impossible for a different contractor to work over the top of the existing contractor.  3)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed.     <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using Recovery Act funds, including compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation , and, to the maximum extent practicable, making fixed-price (FP) contract awards using competitive procedures.  However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts.  Although Mobile District's contract was not awarded as a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside, and the contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  The existing Operation and Maintenance contract has experienced personnel and documented performance to mitigate the Government's risk.  In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing Operation and Maintenance contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles for the work anticipated under this modification.  <BR>

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort and states whether Offeror is a facilities based firm, non-facilities based firm, or both.<br />Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation and/or a direct internet link showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement.<br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(iv) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(v) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.<br />(u) Reporting of Funds. This contractual vehicle is used to authorize local communications services and does not obligate funds. The funded amount(s) indicate the yearly authorization totals for reporting purposes only.<br />(v) Tariff Information. <br />(1) The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer-<br />(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);<br />(ii) Before filing, any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for new or changes to, applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and<br />(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in support of or in connection with an application under paragraph (a)(2) of this clause.<br />(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be facility-based local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) All pricing for this acquisition is firm-fixed pricing in accordance with FAR 12.207 and 16.201-1. A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes in performing the contract. If the prices differ from established tariff prices then it is the responsibility of the vendor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant governmental authorities or to make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.<br />(C) All taxes, fees, and surcharges are subject to applicable tariff rates and charges. If such rates are applicable to this contract, the contractor must notify 38 EIG/PKK for authorization on the CSA before invoicing the customer. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change. The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.<br />(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services. <br />(1) This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services previously authorized on CSA F34608-98-H-5017 0018 . <br />(2) For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or termination (including termination for cause or government convenience). <br />(3) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete.

<p>PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection utilizing Past Performance Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />Factor 1 - Organizational Representatives. This factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offeror states whether <br />Offeror is a facilities-based firm or non-facilities based firm. Also, provide documented evidence<br />of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides <br />documentation showing that Offeror is a Local Exchange Carrier certificated by the affiliated <br />state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide the services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br /><br />Factor 4 - Local Communications Services. This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a site-specific diagram <br />and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix <br />10 requirements.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. <br /><br />(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform this specific effort. This risk assessment represents the Government's judgment of the probability an Offeror can successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on present and past performance. <br />(i) Relevant performance includes performance of efforts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude, and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(iii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iv) The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -- Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -- No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-4 ADDENDUM to 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or any body with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs.

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.<br />(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities.

The full text of a FAR clause may be accessed electronically at http://www.acqnet.gov/far.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis for the purchase of Network Appliance support for existing SAN equipment at BIMC.  CA/CST/II owns and has in use Network Appliance SAN equipment.  As part of CA/CST's migration from CLASS to eCLASS, CST purchased and installed 4 Storage Area Networks (SANs) from Network Appliances (NetApp).  The SAN equipment, however, is still in use and is essential part to CA/CST/II Operations.  By estending support for the equipment, CA can ensure that Newwork Appliance will provide premium 7X24 hour onsite support.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government's requirements, for DoS infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  The warranty support must be bought directly from Net App brand warranty coverage for equipment.  An identification of the satutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.  The 41 USC 253 (c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as satutory authority.  a demonstration thatthe proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.  As this is a brand name only justificatin, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the faxix for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet DoS's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system.  due to C's inventment and aoverall satisfaction with the Net App RNWL equipment and the service that Network Appliance provides, it would be counter-productive and unnecessary costly to attempt to identify, acquire, and install new hardware and new services at this time, assuming that an alternative could be found that offers identical functionality and ease of use.  because this service has already been successfully used, CA/CST believes that it is in the Government's best overall interest to procure and this particualar product.<BR><BR>

1752.224-70 		Protecting Personally Identifiable Information (May 2009)	   	

	(a)	Applicability

	This clause applies to contractor personnel and addresses specific OPM requirements in addition to those included in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a - the Act).  The following should not be construed to alter or diminish civil and/or criminal liabilities provided under the Act.

	(b)	Definition of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

	Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that can be used to discern or trace a person's identity, such as name, social security number, biometric records, and that combined with other information, can be used to compromise the integrity of agency records relating to a person, by permitting access to unauthorized disclosure of these records. For example, a name alone would generally not constitute PII, but when linked to his or her social security number, date of birth, or mother's maiden name, would constitute PII. In other words, PII refers to any information, on any medium, that identifies a specific individual whether the information is on paper or electronic. 

	(c)	Responsibilities for Handling PII

		(1)	Contract employees shall not remove PII from their individual assigned duty station without prior approval of their supervisor. 

		(2)	All contract employees are personally responsible for the proper handling of PII, regardless of location.  All contract employees must be:
&#61607;	responsible for the proper control and handling of PII residing on their computer, on removable media, and on paper documents.
&#61607;	responsible for ensuring portable data storage and communication devices are properly controlled and secured at all times.
&#61607;	responsible for the proper marking, control and storage of printouts and other paper documents containing PII in their possession.
&#61607;	Email cannot be encrypted.  Since PII must be encrypted before being sent, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  Do not send PII in the content of an email.

	(d)	Encryption of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

		(1)	OPM has a policy protecting, and when appropriate, restricting sending, copying or moving PII from the OPM network.  Therefore, if the contract employees must send PII, send it only as an encrypted attachment.  OPM employees and contractors are required to encrypt PII data using WinZip.  Instructions on how to use WinZip to encrypt and protect files containing PII are available on Theo at: http://theo.opm.gov/helpdesk/selfhelp/WinZipv90EncryptionProcedures.pdf. WinZip can be used to protect data on workstations, laptops and email attachments.  It is available on all OPM workstations attached to the agency’s network.   

		(2)	A password protected file is not secure.  Never send any unencrypted PII data in e-mail.   

	(e)	Procedures for Reporting a Breach of PII

		(1)	A breach of PII includes loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access of personally identifiable information whether physical or electronic.  As an agency, OPM is required to immediately report all potential PII data breaches -- whether they involve paper documents or electronic information.  In order to meet this responsibility, OPM has established a new internal procedure for reporting the loss or possible compromise of any PII, and this clause conforms to that procedure. 

		(2)	OPM contractors must report any breach or potential breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer within 30 minutes of becoming aware of the risk – regardless of the time or day of the week.  Breaches should be reported, even if it is believed the breach is limited, small, or insignificant. OPM’s IT security experts, who will determine when a breach needs additional focus and attention.  The OPM Situation Room is available 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Report the breach to the OPM Situation Room and the Contracting Officer either by phone or by e-mail; however, be sure NOT to include PII in the e-mail.

sitroom@opm.gov

	(b)	Any information made available to the Contractor by the Government must be used only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this contract and must not be divulged or made known in any manner to any person except as may be necessary in the performance of the contract.

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is HSCG23-10-Q-DBM002 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-37. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 611519 with a small business size standard of $7,000,000.</p>
<p>The USCG anticipates awarding a firm fixed price contract for one base year plus four optional periods. Contractor is to provide a two week course (9 business days designated to train Coast Guard personnel in Commercial Truck Driving and one day of Forklift Training) annually at the three USCG national strike force team locations in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) (See Attachment I). The Government will provide the vehicles and training facilities and the Contractor shall provide instructors, aids, and training materials. Students will obtain their Commercial Driver's License (CDL) learner's permit prior to class commencement and training shall conclude with the students in each strike team location obtaining a Commercial Class A license. Course and Strike Team Locations are Atlantic Strike Team in Fort Dix, New Jersey; Gulf Strike Team in Mobile, Alabama; Pacific Strike Team in Novato, California. Course dates will be scheduled after contract award and after each option year exercise. Course Information: Three (3) courses per year, Class Duration: ten (10) business days, CDL and Forklift Class Size: Four (4) students. Contract line items and option years for this requirement are listed in Attachment II.</p>
<p>The provisions 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, and 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items apply to this acquisition.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999): <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Evaluation will be based on technical capability, key personnel, past performance and price. Technical capability, key personnel and past performance, when combined, are more important than price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Capability - The Coast Guard will evaluate the overall quality, reasonableness and soundness of the contractor's technical approach as it relates to understanding and satisfying the Government's requirement. Therefore, Contractors shall present their proposed technical capability that at a minimum addresses:</p>
<p>1) Your technical approach to satisfying the SOW requirements including the proposed course outline, daily lesson plans, course objectives, and your demonstration that the proposed course meets the USCG requirements.</p>
<p>2) Your corporate experience so that the USCG can assess whether contractors have performed similar work before in performing contracts/orders of comparable size and complexity to those described in this RFQ. <br /><br />Factor 2. Key Personnel: The Coast Guard will evaluate the extent to which key personnel resumes reflect the education and experience required by the SOW to successfully perform on this contract. Personnel assigned to or utilized by the contractor in the performance of this contract shall, as a minimum, meet the experience, educational, or other background requirements, and shall be fully capable of performing in an efficient, reliable, and professional manner. The USCG will review resumes of the Contractor's personnel proposed to be assigned, and if personnel are not currently in the employ of the Contractor, a written agreement from the potential employee to work shall be part of the quotation. Resume entries shall detail specific skills and include separate entries for each position in which those skills were performed.</p>
<p>Factor 3. Relevant Past Performance: The Coast Guard will evaluate the relevant past performance on projects of comparable scope and complexity. Therefore, Contractors shall provide recent past performance information for services directly related and relevant to the services to be performed under the Statement of Work. Past Performance describes how well you performed the work on other requirements. Relevant is defined as work that is pertinent to the Statement of Work and is of the same quality of service, timeliness or scheduling and similar business relations. To be considered recent, the services must have been performed within the past three years. Contractors shall include three references consisting of : (1) the contract number; (2) the agency or company for which the work was performed; (3) a summary of the work product(s) and similarities with the requirements of this RFQ; and (4) the name of the contracting and technical person(s) to be contacted with their address, telephone, email address and facsimile numbers. If there is no past performance information, please provide the following statement in your quote "No Past Performance information available".</p>
<p>The USCG reserves the right to utilize past performance information other than the information submitted with the quotations received in conducting the evaluation. A Contractor without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance, but will receive a neutral rating. The USCG may consider past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is considered relevant.</p>
<p>Factor 4: Price:</p>
<p>(a) Contractor's price quotation shall provide a unit price for one (1) two-week Commercial Trucking Driving and Forklift Course on a Firm-Fixed Price basis for each CLIN on Attachment II. Price will be evaluated to determine fair and reasonableness. The Government will evaluate quotations and may award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial quotations should contain the offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. The Government may award to other than the lowest priced offeror.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<DESC>Amendment W91ZLK10T0063 0001 is issued to provide answers to questions and  clarifications.  The closing date of the solicitation has changed to December 22, 2009 @ 11:00 AM Eastern Standard Time. Please reference the attached updated Performance Work Statement (Attachment 1). Please SUBMIT YOUR QUOTATIONS to Ms. Sowa at the RDECOM Contracting Center Aberdeen Installation Contracting Division, 4118 Susquehanna Avenue, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005-3013.  Quotations may be submitted via email to:  susan.sowa@us.army.mil or Fax 410-306-3726. Quotations must be signed, dated, and received by the closing date.  For questions concerning this Request for Quotations contact Susan Sowa Contracting Specialist @ email susan.sowa@us.army.mil   Additional questions must be received no later than December 18 @ 11:00AM.<BR><BR>Clarifications: <BR><BR> a.  Modify the Peformance Work Statement to add: The environmental test cabinet/s described will be constructed for the purpose of performing both High Temperature, Low Temperature and Humidity testing. The cabinet/s shall be required to perform tests in general accordance with MIL-STD-810G, Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests, Methods 501.5, 502.5 and 507.5, respectively.  Reference the attached Performance Work Statement. <BR><BR>b. Modify Spec # 11 to add to the last sentence:  Temperature cabinet shall be stable enough and have pockets to allow forklift transport. Reference the attached Performance Work Statement.<BR><BR>Questions and Answers:<BR><BR>QUESTION 1. Specification Number 2:  the specification calls out 5% (or Lower) to 98% but there is no indication of the temperature at which you need this humidity range. In particular, at what temperature do you need to maintain 5% or lower?<BR>ANSWER 1.  In general accordance with the Humidity test, MIL-STD-810G, Environmental Engineering Considerations and Laboratory Tests, Method 507.5, the humidity range is bounded by 85C(185F) maximum dry bulb temperature and a 4C(40F) minimum dew point. <BR><BR>QUESTION 2. Specification Number 5: The specification calls out a weather proof receptacle on the exterior of the cabinet. Is this chamber going to be mounted outdoors? If so, please describe the conditions it will be seeing.<BR>ANSWER 2.  The cabinet will not be outdoors and the receptacle doesn't have to be a weatherproof, however if must be NEMA rated.<BR><BR>QUESTION 3. Specification Number 6: The specification calls out a weatherproof enclosure for the microstar. Is this chamber going to be mounted outdoors as was asked in my questioning on specification 5?<BR>ANSWER 3. The cabinet will not be outdoors and doesn't have to be a weatherproof enclosure however, the enclosure for the electronics needs to provide adequate ventilation to prevent the electronics from overheating and at the same time minimize dust accumulation.<BR><BR>QUESTION 4. Specification Number 15: The specification calls out a Honeywell DC230. Can we use a preapproved equivalent?<BR>ANSWER 4.  The Honeywell DC230 is preferred to allow for uniform components throughout the chamber inventory; maintenance and calibration.<BR><BR>QUESTION 5. Specification Number 24: The specification calls out lock/unlock designated casters. Are front floor levelers acceptable, that when adjusted properly, prevent the chamber from rolling?<BR>ANSWER 5.  Floor levelers are acceptable, the intent is to have a positive lock system that is readily accessible and easily engaged when space is limited.<BR><BR>QUESTION 6. Specification Number 25: The specification calls out temperature limited sheath heaters, but this type of heating device does not comply with Class II, Division II Explosion Proof guidelines. Can you explain why this was specified when in Specification 27, it states that you require Class II, Division II, on the inside of the chamber?<BR>ANSWER 6.  The sheath heater shall be exempt from Class II requirements due to the fact it is limited to 250F surface temperature.   <BR><BR>QUESTION 7. Specification Number 27: The specification calls out not using electrical components/connections inside the chamber OR the components inside the chamber need to meet Class II, Division II Explosion Proof. Do you consider the OR statement as being the vendors choice? In other words, if the vendor provides sheath heaters and an explosion proof light, do you consider that acceptable for proper safety with hazardous/explosive materials?<BR>ANSWER 7.  YES<BR><BR><BR><BR>

For questions concerning this Request for Quotations contact Susan Sowa Contracting Specialist @ email susan.sowa@us.army.mil   Additional questions must be received no later than December 18, 2009 @ 11:00AM.<BR><BR>Questions and Answers:<BR><BR>QUESTION 8. Specification No.1: How is chamber expected to achieve +350F with heaters limited to +250F as stated in Item 25?<BR>ANSWER:  A 250F high temperature range within the compartment is acceptable. The limits are established for ammo/explosive testing however, in the event the customer chooses to achieve a 350F degree capability, the limit would be disabled or adjusted.  The limit will control the heater surface temperature which is set at 250F allowing the heater to cycle as needed. <BR><BR>QUESTION 9. Specification No. 29: Cannot find any reference to a Digitech Model 6714 or similar printer with a take-up reel, it maybe obsolete. Can this requirement be further clarified or alternate suggested? <BR>ANSWER. With the PWS citing or equivalent this allows vendors to assist the customer and conduct research and/or utilize their subject matter experts to determine if other options/suggestions are available. A suggested printer with take-up reel would be a Keltron (24-62 column, RS232 interface, 110VAC power input thermal printer) in place of the obsolete Digitek printer.<BR><BR>

3.    	Does the government anticipate the use of an assistant to the photographer? If so, is the assistant entitled to per diem as well. 
Answer:
An assistant is at the discretion of the photographer and per diem costs will not be covered.
4.	What forms I need to provide to you along with this solicitation?
Answer:
See question/answer 8 below:
Other than that there are no specific Federal Government forms to be provided with the proposal.  However, each quoter desiring award of a Purchase Order as a result of their proposal shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR)  Https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx. or Google: ccr.gov.  
Note each potential registrant in CCR must have a DUNS Number.  Each quoter must state affirmatively they are registered in CCR. Each vendor shall be registered and must state affirmatively they are registered in Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov/   As it takes some time for new registrants to actually be registered in the both of the above, each quoter who is registering for the first time shall provide their DUNS # with their proposal.  No personnel in the Department of the Interior or the National Park Service are able to assist with either of the two programs.
Each price quote must be submitted in the following format:

6.	When will the NPS be deciding the contractor? 
Answer:
In this acquisition each proposal will be evaluated as described in the solicitation synopsis.  The NPS anticipates award in January or early February.  	7.	When is the project scheduled to begin?

8.	Is there any provision for progress or milestone payments over the months of work to cover film & processing expenses and flights/lodging/travel?
Answer:
The vendor can submit monthly payments to the Contracting Officer for payment.




9.	When are the cemeteries available for photography.  What days are the cemeteries accessible to the photographer and what hours of the day? Will there be coordination with the cemetery management or will the photographer be alone to capture the views as light allows?
Answer:
The project will be rigorously coordinated with the American Battle Monuments Commission (AMBC) and the individual cemeteries, and except for special events, access will be allowed.
10.	The statement of work, page 2, Deliverables states "original negatives.... and contact prints (2 per) or high-resolution scans on HALS photo mount cards and electronic scans on a CD"  Please clarify deliverables:a.	Original negative and 2 prints per image.  Are both images to be on photo mount cards?(HALS standards usually require only one of the two prints on photo mount cards)
Answer:If contact prints are produced instead of digital scans on cards, only one set on mount cards is neededb.	High resolution scans can be used in place of the prints and put on photo mount cards?
Answer:
High resolution scans printed onto photo mount cards is fine.
c.	Electronic scans on CD are in addition to the negatives and prints on photo mount cards?  Or in place of archival prints?
Answer:
CD is required if high resolution scans are produced as in answer # e above and not required if contact prints are delivered.

<p>--Next, the government technical team shall evaluate, on a pass/fail basis, the technical proposals submitted by the lowest priced offerors (approximately the lowest 5 proposals) against the following evaluation factor:</p>
<p>Resume: Resumes submitted will be evaluated to determine if the employee meets the requirements indicated in the PWS. If the offeror is the sole employee, only the offeror's resume is required. If the offeror is a company proposing a staffing relationship, a resume for any/all employees intended to fill the position is required.</p>
<p>By submission of an offer, the offeror accedes to these terms. Award will be made without discussions - contractors are encouraged to offer their most advantageous pricing with their response. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from both a price and a technical standpoint. Failure of an Offeror's proposal to meet any given requirement may result in the entire proposal being found to be unacceptable and eliminated from further consideration.</p>
<p>Once determinations are made regarding technical acceptability of proposals, award will be made to the lowest priced offeror who submitted a proposal rated technically acceptable. (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>Classification Code: R - Professional, administrative, and management support services</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 541511 - Custom Computer Programming Services</p>
<p>This modification deletes paragraph six of the original Sources Sought Notice dated 22 Oct 09, and replaces it in its entirety with the following:</p>
<p>Foreign participation is excluded at the prime contractor level, unless authorized through a current approved National Interest Determination (NID). All information generated or maintained under this effort is export controlled. Therefore, prospective offerors must provide a completed and approved DD Form 2345 which certifies the offeror is on the Certified Contractors Access List (CCAL) or the offeror is seeking application to CCAL. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistics Information Service at 1-877-352-2255 or on the web at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/. It is solely the responsibility of the contractor to obtain an export license from the U. S. Department of State and to comply with the federal laws and regulations. Questions concerning the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and export licensing must be directed to the U.S. Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and not the Air Force Project Engineer, Contracting Office, or Air Force Foreign Disclosure Office. Under the current contract, the work requires a TOP SECRET facility clearance and approximately 50 personnel with TOP SECRET / SCI security clearances. Based on current estimates, approximately 30 personnel with Top Secret SCI clearances will be required for performance at time of award. An additional 20 cleared personnel is estimated to be required within the first 45 - 60 days.</p>
<p>All other information publicized in the original synopsis is correct.</p>

<DESC>The Air Force is planning to acquire a Common Vertical Lift Support Platform (CVLSP) to replace the current USAF UH-1N fleet.  It is anticipated the USAF fleet of 62 UH-1Ns will all be replaced, with possibly up to 93 air vehicles.  The Air Force is considering an incremental acquisition approach.  The first increment is anticipated to be a production contract beginning in FY12.  To assist in this effort, the Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) Capabilities Planning Division (ASC/XRX), Wright-Patterson AFB OH, is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Capability Request for Information (SSS/CRFI) to obtain market insight into potential solutions and sources capable of providing at least 16 aircraft no later than 30 September 2017.  Additionally, at least six of those aircraft wit! h sufficient training and other support (initial spares, support equipment, data, etc.) to operate those aircraft are required to declare Initial Operational Capability (IOC) no later than 30 September 2015.
CVLSP is expected to be an in-production, non-developmental, Government Off-The-Shelf or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (GOTS/COTS) solution.  Meeting schedule is critical and we will consider some performance trade-offs to meet schedule at an affordable cost.  If the solution cannot meet all the capabilities, describe the capabilities your solution can meet if a production decision is made in FY12 and describe the cost and schedule needed to meet all the capabilities.  If a respondent has more than one solution to discuss, a separate response for each is desired.  Respondents must describe their solutions' compatibility and comparability to the given capabilities, rough order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost estimates, delivery schedules, and other market information of potential solutions. This moves the information originally posted here to an attachment.

Description

The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) seeks to identify and obtain information from responsible sources in connection with the privatization of the electric distribution (NAICS 221122), water distribution (NAICS 221310), and wastewater collection (NAICS 221320) utility systems at Columbus Air Force Base (AFB), Mississippi.    Privatization is defined as the conveyance of a utility system to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system.  Utility Privatization (UP) will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. §2688 – Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.

Contractor will be required to assume ownership of the electric, water, and wastewater utility systems at Columbus AFB, Mississippi, and as the new owner, shall operate and maintain the system and provide utility services to the Government. Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, management, supervision, permits, equipment, supplies, materials, transportation, and any other incidental items or services required for the complete ownership of and provision of utility services via these utility systems, including operation, maintenance, repair, upgrades, and improvements to the utility systems.

This Sources Sought Notice (hereinafter “Notice”) is an essential step in determining market interest and feasibility.  Responses received will be used to develop marketing strategies for the potential privatization of utilities at this installation.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal solicitation may be forthcoming.  Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead by no later than 3:00 pm EDT on Friday, May 29, 2009.  Responses are preferred via e-mail, but hard copies and facsimiles will also be accepted.

At a minimum, the statement of interest shall address:  (1) capability and experience in utility privatization or owning and operating utility systems; (2) financial capability to justify potential award of such a contract; (3) a primary point of contact, including phone number and e-mail address; and (4) an indication of the size of the business (large, small, or any sub-category of small business).  The potential opportunity for set-asides for small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses will be considered on the basis of the responses received.

This Notice is solely for the Government’s use as a market research tool.  As such, the issuance of a competitive solicitation is not guaranteed.  If determined appropriate, then both a synopsis and a solicitation may be anticipated in the July 2009 timeframe.  All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a response to this Notice.  All information received will be considered.  Failure to respond to this Notice does not preclude a firm from offering on any resultant solicitation; however, a lack of interest in this requirement may keep this effort from moving forward competitively.  

This announcement shall not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of an award.  The Government is not bound to make any awards under this Notice.

If you are interested in this project, please provide the information requested above to the DESC Contracting Office.

Installation Description

The electric distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

The primary distribution circuits are both overhead on utility poles and underground in conduit. The distribution system is constructed primarily in a radial configuration with provisions for crossties between circuits and within its own circuit, which allows operational flexibility for maintenance and outage considerations. There are no substations and  no switching stations, but there are some pad-mounted switches. There is one 15 kV class switchgear lineup located at the Flight Simulator Building, B268, which selects the primary feed from the dedicated Flight Simulator Circuit, 214, and an alternate feed. The switchgear consists of two 15 kV fused switches to select the primary feed and six fused switches feeding the six 750 kVA power transformers feeding the Flight Simulator Building.  Other major system components include pad-mounted switches, transformers, utility poles, utility manholes, and meters.  The meters are transformer rated electromechanical and transformer electronic. The base employs a mix of overhead pole mounted distribution transformers, three-phase and single-phase pad-mounted distribution transformers and four sets of pad-mounted aerial distribution transformers. The average depth for buried components is 3’ – 4’ and approximately 10% of the ductbank and conduit is beneath paved surfaces.  Specifically excluded from the electric distribution system privatization are: Airfield Lighting, Emergency Power Generators, Parking lots and pedestrian pathway lighting fed off the building internal source, Water tower beacon lights, Military Family Housing, Shuqualak Auxiliary Field, Greenwood Springs Next Generation Site, Munitions Storage Area (MSA), and the Energy Management Control System (EMCs). 

The water distribution system being privatized is described as follows: 

The complete water distribution system consists of buried piping ranging in size from ¾-inch service lines to the 16-inch water main at depths from 3 to 14 feet, an average depth of 6 feet.  The water mains and service lines are oversized cast iron (CI), transite (asbestos cement or AC), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or polyethylene (PE) pipe installed anytime from the 1940s to 2007.  Plastic pipe installed within the last decade, or planned to be installed in the near future, is installed with tracer wire.  There are more than 900 service connections base wide.  Approximately 5% of the distribution system mains and roughly 10% of lateral lines lie under paved surfaces.  All gate valves are contained in valve boxes and are exercised regularly.  The system pressure ranges from 60 to 66 pounds per square inch (psi).  The water quality is regulated by the Mississippi State Department of Health under Public Water System (PWS) No. 0440018 and is tested quarterly.  All fire hydrants and fire lines are connected to the potable water distribution system.  Many hydrants have been replaced over the years and are exercised regularly.  All base irrigation comes from potable water, but is also regulated with backflow prevention (BFP).  The Whispering Pines Golf Course irrigation system is operated by golf course services and is not being transferred.  The contractor will install new secondary meters on the outlet side of each BFP separating the golf course irrigation system from the main distribution system and the new PODs will be the outlet side of the new meters  The Magnolia, State and Capitol Village Military Family Housing (MFH) areas were privatized in October of 2007.  The water distribution systems within military family housing are owned by Pinnacle Hunt Company and PODs for the utility have been established for transition of ownership.  Ten buildings with 20 housing units within Capitol Village Housing remain the property of Columbus AFB as Temporary Living Facilities (TLF).  The inlet of the laterals from the main to the outlet of the residential meters at these houses is owned by CAFB.  Ownership of the existing meters and laterals are to be transferred to the contractor.  Specifically excluded from the water distribution system privatization are: Shuqualak Auxiliary Field, Greenwood Springs, Military Family Housing, Irrigation systems, Non-potable fire systems, Supplementary Water Wells, 10,000 Gallon Elevated Water Storage Tank (near MSA), Water Tower Lights, Energy Management Control System.

The wastewater collection system being privatized is described as follows: 

Columbus AFB wastewater is collected throughout the base using service laterals, gravity mains, and force mains. A force main from the main base passes through manhole #63, where an eight inch pipe then carries it to the discharge point. The discharge point lies approximately 200 feet west of the Columbus AFB south gate. The Columbus Light and Water Department (CL&W) then collects the discharge from the installation and treats the wastewater.  A majority of the existing concrete pipe is dated more than 50 years old; however Insituform® (cured-in-place), was inserted in 2000 to preserve the existing system. Currently, the system consists of vitrified clay, concrete with Insituform® concrete, asbestos cement, cast iron, and a few segments of PVC. No tracer wire, marker tape, industrial waste collection system, wastewater treatment plant, or cathodic protection is present on the installation. Pipe size ranges from 4 inches to 12 inches. The system’s average burial depth ranges from 3 to 14 feet, with an average burial depth of 8.5 feet deep. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the pipes are beneath paved surfaces.  There are a total of ten lift stations: four main lift stations tied to the force mains, and six smaller lift stations servicing other areas of the base. All three housing areas were privatized in 2007; therefore components in these areas are not being transferred. However, the force main leading from the Capitol Village Housing area to manhole #63 is included in this inventory.  Specifically excluded from the wastewater distribution system privatization are: Shuqualak Auxiliary Field, Military Family Housing, Greenwood Springs, Grease Traps, Oil / Water Separators (OWS), Septic Tanks, Leach Fields, Grit Chambers, and Energy Management Control System (EMCS).

<DESC>AMENDED TO UPDATE EXPECTED RFP ISSUANCE DATE TO ON OR ABOUT JANUARY 6, 2010.<br /><br /><br />The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Federal Protective Service (FPS) is responsible for providing security and law enforcement services for federal facilities. <br />The ICE Office of Acquisition (OAQ) plans to offer a requirement for a Computer Aided Dispatch Information System (CADIS) in support of the FPS Law Enforcement Mission.<br />To eliminate current functionality gaps and to address new law enforcement requirements a new system is needed that will automate core FPS law enforcement business processes and will result in a more standardized, integrated, and efficient national information technology solution for FPS. The system must provide a level of scalability and compatibility with other DHS, ICE, and FPS systems and shall always be in compliance with emerging DHS enterprise architecture. Further, the system must reflect the seamless integration of the following three functional components. <br />1) Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System for personnel dispatching in response to incidents.<br />2) Record Management System (RMS) to collect, share, and report incident information based on National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) standards. A system to conduct efficient call center management, which includes automated data collection, calls routing, viewing call history, etc.<br />3) Geographic Information System (GIS) to provide location information to assess dangerous sites, improving routing, vehicle tracking and to display other relevant neighborhood information.
<p>Furthermore, the proposed CADIS must replace the current Daily Operations Log (DOL) and Web Records Management System (WebRMS). <br />CADIS shall have the capability to collect, modify, store, retrieve, and process record management and geographic information data via a report management function and a record management system. CADIS will improve FPS Officer Safety, as the current manual processes will be automated; reducing the chances of critical errors by removing the extensive liability that currently exists with the dispatchers. Additionally, CADIS will provide intelligent resources in reporting information that is needed to make knowledgeable business decisions and aid in criminal analysis, helping FPS' efforts in providing preventative security measures. <br />Specifically, the system shall:<br />&bull; Be fully National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) compliant<br />&bull; Implement a system availability of 99.999 percent when measured on a 24-hour per day, seven day a week basis for 365 days. Processor, disk storage, and power supply redundancy may be required in order to achieve the desired availability and protection of information. The system shall be configured such that operating a training component and/or running reports will not affect system response time.<br />&bull; Interface with external applications and data sources.<br />&bull; Have the ability to push the client application via the DHS network to desktops and Mobile Computing Devices (MCD) via the internal network.<br />&bull; Allow a user the ability to access the application, download appropriate information and forms relating to incidents, and submit the necessary information without re-keying information. <br />&bull; Allow the capability to be directly expandable by adding hardware and Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) modules. <br />&bull; Include a feature for backup, archival and recovery capability without taking CADIS out of service and with minimal impact on dispatch operations. <br />&bull; Provide the capability for users to work offline in the event of connectivity failures, and the capability to continue to work off-line in the event the failure occurs in the middle of a session without any data loss, and to upload saved offline data when connectivity is re-established.<br />&bull; Contain data exporting capabilities. CADIS must have the capability to export data in industry standard database formats to facilitate providing data to other databases controlled by DHS and/or other government entities. <br />&bull; Be able to generate standard automated forms and templates to be used by all regions; such as incident report, spot report, etc.<br />&bull; Contain a wide variety of reports and statistical information for analysis and management reporting and/or reporting requirements in real time. <br />&bull; Allow ad-hoc, dynamically generated reports such that code modifications are not required for each new report.</p>
<p>It is the intent of FPS to adapt to the current industry best practices as it relates to the FPS operating procedures and the operating environment of CADIS. Implementing CADIS will enable key FPS stakeholders the opportunity to assess current operating procedures against any productivity gains that can be realized through the introduction of automation. Consequently, neither a blanket "technology driving the process," nor a "process driving the technology" approach will be embraced, but a balanced approach that seriously evaluates the cost/benefit trade-off in moving from current to new operating procedures.</p>
<p>A full and open competition is anticipated with a request for proposals expected to be issued on or about&nbsp;January 6, 2010&nbsp;with proposals due approximately 30 days later.</p>

<DESC>(Numbered Note 22 – “Underline Note 22 if this is a noncompetitive actions”)
The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) intends to exercise an option placed on delivery order 1035 under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-05-G-0026.  Delivery Order 1035 was awarded to The Boeing Company (Boeing), P.O. Box 3707, 7755 East Marginal Way, Seattle, WA  98124-2499, on an other than full and open competition basis for studies in support of the P-8A aircraft.  This option will provide planning and analysis required to develop a comprehensive P-8A Special Mission Configuration Test Program.  The contract action requires expertise in P-8A engineering, integration and testing.  A sole source acquisition will be procured under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.”  Boeing is the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the Boeing P-8A airframe, as well as the sole integrator of the avionics systems, and therefore is the only contractor with the requisite knowledge, experience, and technical data that can meet the Government’s requirements on a timely basis.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties, however, may identify their interest and capability by responding to this requirement.  The Government will consider all capability information received prior to the closing date of this synopsis.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed delivery order, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  No phone inquiries will be entertained.  Responses shall be made in writing by e-mail, U.S. mail or facsimile to the attention of Jessica Norris using the contact information provided in this synopsis.  Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Boeing directly.  Numbered note 22 (sole source) apply.

<DESC>After reconsideration, the Government will continue this procurement as a Design-Build as we only have about a 35% design. This project is O&amp;M funds and not MILCON. MILCON funded projects do not require use of a two phase procurement approach. Being O&amp;M funds with only a 35% design we will revise the solicitation to a two phase procurement process. The first phase will require a Technical Volume (experience and past performance) and no Price Volume. The second phase will be a Price Volume and Technical Volume (a streamlined technical approach). The plan is to leave the due date the same for the first phase, December 21, 2009, and have the second phase to the short listed offerors Dec 23 with Phase 2 proposals due Tuesday, December 29, 2009. The goal is to award by December 31, 2009 before funds are pulled.

Register via the Internet Site at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/default.aspx or by contacting the DoD Electronic Commerce Information Center at 1-800-334-3414 and complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Contractor Performance Evaluations: In accordance with the provisions of Subpart 36.604 (Performance Evaluation) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), A-E contractors performance shall be evaluated throughout the performance of the contract.  The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) follows the procedure s outlined in Engineering Pamphlet (EP) 715-1-7 to fulfill this FAR requirement. For A-E contracts awarded at or above $30,000 the USACE will evaluate contractors performance and prepare a performance report using the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS), which is now a web-based system.  After an evaluation (interim or final) is written up by the USACE, the contractor will have the ability to access, review and comment on the evaluation for a period of 30 days.  Accessing and using ACASS requires specific software, called PKI certification, which is installed on the users computer.  The certification is a Department of Defense requirement and was implemented to provide security in electronic transactions.  The certification software could cost approximately $110-$125 per certificate per year and is purchased from an External Certificate Authorities (ECA) vendor.  Current information about the PKI certification process and for contacting vendors can be found on the web site: https://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/.  If the Contractor wishes to participate in the performance evaluation process, access to ACASS and PKI certification is the sole responsibility of the Contractor.<BR><BR>The Secretary of the Army Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) requirement will be incorporated into this contract.  The annual CMR requirement will apply to each task order which is funded by Army dollars; supports an Army mission; which benefits or supports any Army military, civilian, or contractor personnel; or when the Army is the executive agency for the mission being supported.  The A-E will be allowed to include their costs for compliance with the CMR requirement as a line item in their price proposal for each task order subject to the CMR requirement.  Further information is available at https://cmra.army.mil.<BR><BR>2.

<DESC>RECOVERY - Modification 01 awarded under Task Order 0003 for additional work under the Efficient Small Scale Propulsion (ESSP) Core Engine Demonstrator Design which obligates Recovery Act funding. Task Order 0003 was awarded on 22 Jun 2009 and funded entirely with Recovery Act funding. The additional work supports the procurement of hardware to support the metallic HP spool demonstrator engine. The contract was solicited and awarded competitively using competitive procedures which resulted in award of 15 contracts. This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price contract type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded per FAR 16.301-2.<br />

<AWARDEE>Smith's Medical PM, Smith's Medical PM
160 Weymouth Street, Rockland, MA 02370 US
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  The Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Medical Supplier Operations Directorate, is the contracting activity. 

2.  The action being approved is the ability to solicit for DLA requirements on an other than full and open competition basis. 

3.  The proposed bridge contract will provide for continuous contract coverage through DSCP’s Medical Equipment Electronic Catalog (“ECAT”) program for the purchase of BCI 3303 GRAC Hand Held Pulse Oximeters including all accessories, repair parts, and consumables. Pulse oximeters, which measure the oxygen saturation level in the bloodstream, are critical items needed to provide quality medical care to deployed warfighters as well as military service members and their dependents in medical treatment facilities (MTFs).   The BCI 3303 GRAC Hand Held Pulse Oximeter is the only pulse oximeter that has been designated by the services as a Patient Movement Item (PMI).  Currently, only one ECAT vendor offers the BCI 3303 GRAC Hand Held Pulse Oximeter and its accessories, repair parts, and consumables, which is Smiths Medical.  This action will result in a sole source contract with Smiths Medical for a six (6) month period bridging the gap between the current contract expiration date of December 21, 2009 and the award of a new contract to Smiths Medical which is currently in the evaluation process.   

 The anticipated value of the proposed bridge contract is $150,000.00.  For administrative purposes, the bridge award will use the same contract number (SPM200-05-D-8202) as the current contract.  The same terms and conditions under the existing contract will be incorporated into the bridge contract. The effective period of the bridge contract will be from December 21, 2009 through June 21, 2010.

4.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

5.  The PMI program consists of designated medical equipment assets (including the consumable supplies needed for their proper use and maintainability) and their associated durable supplies necessary for patient transport.  The mission of the PMI system is to support patients in- transit.  PMI accompanies a patient throughout the chain of movement, from the originating MTF to the destination MTF, whether it is an intra-theater or inter-theater transfer. Logistics personnel must ensure that the PMI is available at the correct location and ready for immediate use.  

The Services selected the Smiths Medical BCI 3303GRAC Pulse Oximeter as the pulse oximeter for use in the PMI system.  During the selection process, experts, consisting of clinicians, technicians, logisticians, and medical personnel, evaluated different manufacturers’ products against a set of Essential Characteristics (ECs) or minimum needs.  These ECs define the critical features that each product had to meet to be considered for the PMI program.  Critical features were verified through testing in an operational environment to simulate use in expected clinical and environmental conditions. 

Specific areas/critical features that were evaluated and found to be favorable for the Smiths Medical Pulse Oximeter include: longer overall life expectancy; lower overall operating costs; and lower overall manpower and personnel requirements. Man hour requirements were evaluated in the following areas: field support repair, preventative maintenance (PM), safety, and ease of calibration. 

 It is critical that DoD maintain the ability to purchase the BCI 3303GRAC Pulse Oximeter as well as its accessories, repair parts, and consumables so that this standardized item is available for purchase within the PMI program and so that replacement parts, consumables and supplies for the BCI 3303GRAC Pulse Oximeter are available for purchase to service the several units that are already in use by the Services.  

6.  This bridge contract will be synopsized in FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR 5.202.  As stated previously, there is an open season solicitation in place and this solicitation was issued on a full and open competition basis.   

7.  I hereby determine that the anticipated cost of this bridge contract will be fair and reasonable based on comparison with the current contract.  Pricing under the proposed bridge contract will be the same as the current contract, which was determined fair and reasonable based on a comparison with commercial pricing.  The same contract terms and conditions in the current contract will apply under this bridge contract.  

8.   As part of its selection process for the PMI pulse oximeter, the Services performed extensive market research.  All current pulse oximeters on the market were considered.  Their determination is periodically reviewed as the need arises in order to keep up with the latest state of the art technology. The Services continue to consider all pulse oximeters on the market during these subsequent reviews. 

Additionally, all potential sources of air certified pulse oximeters were solicited under the current Open Season solicitation which was issued February 9, 2007 and closes January 29, 2012.   As of February 24, 2009 there have been 46 offers received in response to the open season solicitation however, no other firms offered the BCI 3303 GRAC Hand Held Pulse Oximeter. 

9.  Smiths Medical has responded to the new Medical Equipment ECAT solicitation, and its new contract is expected to be awarded within the six (6) month bridge period, effective December 22, 2009 through June 21, 2010.  This bridge contract shall stay in place only until the effective date of the new contract, which will be awarded under full and open competition.  Should the new contract become effective before the six (6) month bridge term ends, the new contract will take precedence over the bridge contract.

10.  Smiths Medical is the only source expressing an interest in the proposed bridge contract. 

11.  The Open Season provides the opportunity for firms to submit offers until the closing date of January 29, 2012.  All such future acquisitions will also be solicited on a full and open competition basis.

12.  As the Contracting Officer, I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<AWARDEE>Science Applications Intl Corp. Mail Stop 1300 Crystal Gate #4 200 12th StreetS. Suite 1500 Arlington, VA 22202
<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement that will be filled under Task 22, of Contract No.NNG06HX04C, for the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) which undertakesresearch and development to maximize the impact of satellite observations in climate,weather and atmospheric composition prediction.  Global models and their associated dataassimilation systems are used to incorporate observations to improve the estimates of thestate of the atmosphere, ocean, or land surface made through model simulations (stateestimates).  To achieve this goal, the GMAO undertakes model and assimilationdevelopment, generates products to support NASA instrument teams and NASA's Earth sceinceprogram, and undertakes scientific research to inform system development pathways. Assimilation systems have been developed for the atmosphere, ocean, and land surface. The long-term goal is an Integrated Earth System Model and Assimilation System wherin theindividual components are treated in a more interactive manner.  The GMAO represents NASAas one of the partners in the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA) withthe goal of accelerating the transition of NASA satellite information into operationalapplications.&lt;P&gt;One of the recent meteorological products generated by the GMAO is the Modern EraRetrospective analysis for Reaearch and Applications (MERRA) from the assimilation ofhistorical atmospheric data (from 1979 to the present).  These data focus on the modernera, i.e., the satellite era.  MERRA has been generated with the Goddard Earth ObservingSystem (GEOS) model, version 5 (GEOS-5) and its associated atmospheric analysis system,the Grid-point Statistical Interpolation (GSI), developed in collaboration with theNOAA/National Centers for Environmental Prediction.  The GEOS-5 system software includesa tool - referred to as the "replay" - which allows the ingest of an existing analysis,like MERRA, into the model as it is running in simulation mode.  This replay thuscontrains the model close to the analysis as if it were undertaking assimilation.&lt;P&gt;GEOS-5 is coupled with the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART)model so that GEOS-5 meteorological states can be used to transport aerosol fields.  Itis also coupled with the Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) chemistry model so thattropospheric and stratospheric trace gases (such as ozone and carbon monoxide) can bemodeled.  The replay capability of GEOS-5 allows us to simulate aerosol and chemistryvariations consistent with GEOS-5 meteorological analysis from assimilation. &lt;P&gt;The task using ARRA funds supports the GMAO's activities and the support requirments arebroken down in 3 subtasks:&lt;P&gt;(a) Progress towards an Integrated Earth System Analysis by undertaking simulations withthe GEOS-5 model coupled to both GOCART (for aerosols) and GMI (for trace gas chemistry),using the replay technique with the MERRA meteorological forcing;&lt;P&gt;(b)  Advances in the assimilation of Advanced Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS) and microwave limbsounder (MLS) radiance data into the GEOS-5 atmospheric data assimilation system (DAS),and &lt;P&gt;(c)  Use of MERRA to contribute to improving cloud and convection parameterizations byplacing satellite data in a meteorological context and expanding the parameter spaceexplored by a single column model (SCM) version of GEOS-5 and cloud resolving model (CRM)simulations to be conducted by the Mesoscale Atmospheric Processes Branch.&lt;P&gt;NASA/GSFC has awarded Task 22 under Contract NNG06HX04C with Science Applications IntlCorp.  Contract No. NNG06HX04C with Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)is a cost plus award fee contract and was awarded on December 28, 2005, on a competitivebasis.	This work could not be performed on a fixed price basis due to variability ofresearch and projects and also due to the nature of R&D work and a reasonable estimate ofthe cost impact could not be made.

<DESC>Recovery Act - This competitive action awarded pursuant to the 2009 NationalAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Research Announcement is partially fundedthrough the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  This award will develop a Vehicle Level Reasoning System (VLRS) that will look across allof the vehicle subsystems (propulsion, flight systems, airframe, and software) forpurposes of determining whether an adverse event has occurred, diagnose the cause,predict the effect on the remaining useful life of the vehicle, and take appropriatesteps to mitigate the event as appropriate.  The VLRS may take advantage of component,subsystem, and vehicle level models which would represent connectivity and potentialcausal chains of failure. Similarly, physics-based models of damage propagation forcertain subsystems (such as the airframe or actuators) may be appropriate for inclusionin the VLRS.  VLRS technologies will produce a significant amount of data that can beused to enable conditioned-based maintenance (CBM) for aircraft.  With CBM, maintenanceactions are performed only when there is an anticipated need, as opposed to regularlyscheduled maintenance actions.	In order to anticipate the need for maintenance, a CBMsystem will use information and data derived from onboard sensors and supportinginstrumentation (such as those under development in NASA's IVHM project) as well asmaintenance logs for the vehicle. The ARRA funded effort includes the design, implementation, and demonstration of aflexible VLRS that is adaptable to legacy and Next-Generation (NextGen) civil andmilitary air-vehicle platforms, including business case and architectural trade studiesto support selection of platform and subsystem demonstration targets, delivery of ahybrid real-time and near real-time VLRS approach providing an integrative approach topropagating, correlating, and assessing the effects of subsystem failures for continuousand discrete data, and a capability to assess and report the effect of lower level systemfailures on vehicle functional goals.  The Base Period ARRA funded portion is $596,245.This effort has the potential for two 12-month Non-ARRA funded Option Periods totaling$1,490,150.  The total award amount, including ARRA and non-ARRA funding, is $2,086,395.  NASA's Aviation Safety Program is conducting research directed at improving the safety ofcurrent and future aircraft operating in the National Airspace System. The research focusis on the way vehicles are designed, built, operated, and maintained, and is organizedinto four project areas: 1) Integrated Vehicle Health Management, 2) IntegratedIntelligent Flight Deck, 3) Integrated Resilient Aircraft Control, and 4) Aircraft Agingand Durability.  This award specifically addresses the Integrated Vehicle HealthManagement (IVHM) project which is conducting research into vehicle health managementtechnologies that will detect, diagnose, predict, and mitigate adverse events that occurduring flight.	Adverse events include those that arise from system, subsystem, orcomponent faults or failures due to damage, degradation, or environmental hazards (suchas turbulence, electromagnetic fields, and lightning).	 This notice is provided for informational purposes only.  A cost plus fixed fee contractwas determined to be most appropriate for this procurement because of the uncertainnature of the research activities required cannot be estimated to the level of accuracynecessary to allow the use of a fixed-priced contractual vehicle.

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., W91278-08-C-0013<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore, the existing contract must be used for the following reasons: 1) The contractor is already in the midst of the job and this modification is to add funding needed to complete the job as a result of unforeseen site conditions.  2) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared. The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to starting the work, because conditions are different at each individual site. 3) The contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures in the Allatoona recreation area. 4) The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance, and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation. 5) This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public assess to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.

<DESC>Procurement Request Number: ____502-10-1-084-0003____________________________      	LSJ Number: ____LSJ502-10-001_________________________________LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION FOR FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE PROGRAMUpon the basis of the following justification, I, as  _Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of sources limited to fewer than those required in FAR 8.405-1, FAR 8.405-2 pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 251 as implemented by  FAR 8.405-6 (b) (1.1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity and specific identification of the document as a limited source justification (LSJ).Alexandria, Louisiana VA Medical Center Contracting Office for use by Pharmacy Service in providing patient care.2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.VAMC Alexandria is in need of purchasing an AutoMed FastPak EXP that will allow us to maintain our current high level of accuracy and service utilizing the most advanced interface barcode packaging system. Currently the Alexandria VAMC has an AutoMed FastPak 330 and it is time for an upgrade to the new hardware since the support for our current hardware will expire on 12/31/2009. The new hardware will utilize our current drug file information and interface which is in place, is stable and supported. 3.	A complete description of the supplies and/or services required to meet the agency's needsThe AutoMed FastPak EXP system will include the Packaging Unit, Replenishment Kit, Includes Implementation Fees and System Interface Fee. The total cost of this contract is $184,000.00. If purchased by the end of this month, the system may be deliverable by February 2010. 4.	An identification of the LSJ rationale, and if applicable, a demonstration of the contractor's unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service."	FAR 8.405-6 (b) (1) - Only one source is capable of responding due to the unique or specialized nature of the work;"	FAR 8.405-6(b)(3) - An urgent or compelling need exists, and following the FSS ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delaysThe Alexandria VAMC has determined that no other company's hardware could utilize our existing interface, replenishment station or Vista option that have proven to be so stable and accurate. The suggested manufacturer is the only company that manufacturers the equipment in question. As such, it is the only company that can continually update the equipment with computerized updates as they become available. These updates keep the equipment current with the latest technology and greatly enhances the pharmacies ability to administer the necessary care to the patient. This new hardware is considered an upgrade to the overall unit dose operating system and replenishment station that we currently have in place. Automed is offering a trade in for our existing hardware (FastPak 330) which will allow us to get the newer version EXP model.5.	A determination by the ordering activity Contracting Officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 8.404(d).Pricing has been determined fair and reasonable by GSA.  Pricing will be taken from published price list on the Federal Supply Schedule.6.	A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders, and the results of the research, or a statement why market research was not conducted.  A statement must be made that the supplies and services are available from the FSS. To describe the Market Research that was conducted for this service, several different things were looked at in detail. First, was the historical acquisition learned from the research. There is a fair amount of historical inpatient automated purchases at this medical center; it was also found that other medical centers throughout VISN 16 have the same equipment. Through these sources, it was learned that this should be handled as a Limited Source because of the proprietary information the company has for its own equipment and the replacement criticality of a significant piece of automation hardware to the unit dose packaging system. Also, it talking with Pharmacy, Bio-med personnel and other knowledgeable people; it was learned that the equipment went out of warranty and a new service contract is unavailable past 12/31/2009. Updated hardware is needed to be eligible for an on-going Service Contract to be in place to assist our Bio-med personnel in the event the repair was beyond their capabilities. Reviewing internet resources did not turn up much information. The Market Research did determine that the requirement could be met by using commercial format because the service needed is customary with commercial industry practices and needs mo modifications to accommodate the Government's requirements.7.	Any other facts supporting the limited source justification. The Alexandria VAMC has determined that no other company's hardware could utilize our existing interface, replenishment station or Vista option that have proven to be so stable and accurate. The suggested manufacturer is the only company that manufacturers the equipment in question. As such, it is the only company that can continually update the equipment with computerized updates as they become available. These updates keep the equipment current with the latest technology and greatly enhances the pharmacies ability to administer the necessary care to the patient. This new hardware is considered an upgrade to the overall unit dose operating system and replenishment station that we currently have in place. Automed is offering a trade in for our existing hardware (FastPak 330) which will allow us to get the newer version EXP model.8.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency will take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for supplies and services is made.Pharmacy staff will keep abreast of market and at the end of the life span will conduct market research to determine if unrestricted consideration can be made  before acquisition of the supplies. 9.	The ordering activity Contracting Officer's certification that the justification is accurate and complete to the best of the Contracting Officer's knowledge and belief and evidence that the supporting data that  form a basis for the justification have been certified as complete and accurate by technical/program personnel.CertificationAcquisition Initiator:                                       I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance, which are included in this justification and which form a basis for this justification, are complete and accurate. ___________//ES//________________    	______12/4/2009_____________            Paul D.

HUD envisioned the creation of new, safe neighborhoods with homeownership opportunities for anyone who wished to pursue the American dream, including public housing residents. And then Hurricane Katrina hit - and HUD and HANO were forced to start from scratch to rebuild and revitalize the city. Over the last several years there have been several leadership teams put in place to try to turn HANO around but it has been an incredible challenge. In addition to rebuilding much of the Big Four projects, HANO has been plagued by ongoing and extreme malfeasance at the highest levels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Many of these actions have been widely publicized in the news media.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it is with this in mind that HUD proposes a radical reorganization and a new Administrative Receivership approach for HANO.</p>
