<DESC>The specific objective of the In vivo Nanoplatforms for Diagnostics (IVN:Dx) thrust of the In vivo Nanoplatforms (IVN) program is to develop biocompatible nanosensors that provide continuous, noninvasive, and highly accurate measurement of a variety of conditions and substances within the living tissue of animals, plants, and insects using non-toxic materials with limited immunogenicity. These sensors will permit qualitative and quantitative assessment over large concentration ranges of both small (e.g., glucose, lactate, and urea) and large molecules (e.g., proteins, oligonucleotides, infectious agents, and chemical/biological threat agents) in the organism and environment through optical, electronic, thermal or magnetic mechanisms.

<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

Rentable square feet offered and full service rental rate per-square-foot<br />4. ANSI/BOMA Usable Square Feet and common area factor<br />5. Number of on-site, paved parking spaces<br />6.

<DESC>In accordance with the FAA Acquisition Management System paragraph 3.2.2.4, the purpose of this announcement is to inform the industry of the basis of the FAA's decision to contract with a selected source via single source procedures.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to award a single source 12 month, bridge contract to Boca Systems Inc, Boca Raton Florida to provide thermal flight strips. The estimated value for this bridge contract is $603,000. 
The FAA contract with Boca Systems, Inc (Contract # DTFAAC-09-08-00008) for thermal flight strips in accordance standard FAAD-F-1374, was for a base year with 4 option years. The third option was not exercised due to an administrative error. 
The rationale for the single source bridge contract is based on the conclusion that Boca Systems, Inc is the only vendor that could provide the thermal flight strips in the timeframe necessary for the FAA to meet mission requirements. Due to time restraints, the FAA determined that it is not feasible to competitively award a contract at this time.  The follow on contract will be competitive. 
This announcement is for informational purposes only, not a Solicitation/Request for Proposal.  A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement. Any questions regarding this announcement must be directed to Brandon Hillyer, Contract Specialist via phone at (405) 954-4712 or via email at brandon.hillyer@faa.gov.

<DESC>******PLEASE CONTACT MARY BRINKLEY/ARCS ONLY FOR ALL TECHNICAL QUESTIONS OR QUOTEISSUES. MARY BRINKLEY'S CONTACT INFORMATION IS IN THE BODY OF THIS SOLICITATION****** NASA/MSFC has a requirement to purchase a new hydraulic power supply, control cables andon-site installation of a hydraulic distribution system for the mechanical test lab. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Manufacturing Technical Solutions (MTS),Inc. Competition is impractical for the following reasons:1.  MTS has specific experience working with current MSFC test facility equipment.Current mechanical test lab controllers and hydraulic power supplies were purchased fromMTS making it impractical for another vendor to supply needed control cabling nor wouldanother vendor possess the knowledge to utilize MTS First on Last Off technology. Dueto possiblesoftware and hardware conflicts MTS is the only viable vendor who can provide therequired control cabling.  2.  NASA/MSFC has a requirement to couple the new hydraulic power supply with the currentvariable flow MTS model 505.180.  Coupling these power supplies requires communicationbetween the existing and new power supply, thus having MTS provide the new power supplyeliminates compatibility issues.  MTS has designed these hydraulic power supplies to becoupled and selection of another vendor would require development of a communicationinterface that adds additional cost. For that reason,  MTS is the only practical vendorfor the hydraulic power supply and control cables that can provide a package thatincludes installation of the hydraulic distribution system.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to Mary.M.Brinkley@nasa.gov no later than 4:30 p.m. cst. on March 22,2012.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">Request for Information<br />Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council (AFMSCC)<br />Overseas Medical Support Services (OCONUS)<br />15 Mar 12<br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and is a follow-up to an RFI covering the same subject in March/April of 2011 with a more focused list of NAICS codes. This RFI shall not be construed as a formal solicitation or an obligation on the part of the government to acquire any product or services. It does not guarantee a subsequent solicitation will be issued. Submission of any information in response to this RFI is completely voluntary, and costs associated with any submission shall not be reimbursed by the Government. The information requested will be used by the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) to facilitate decision making.</p>
<p>The Air Force Medical Service Commodity Council (AFMSCC) is seeking interested sources to provide information on clinical support services; medical administrative support services; and Advisory &amp; Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) in support of Air Force Air Staff medical, Air Force MAJCOM medical or Air Force military treatment in Department of Defense facilities in the overseas environment (such as Japan, South Korea, Italy, England, Germany, Portugal and Turkey). The work may augment existing clinical support services, medical support services, and A&amp;AS provided by Air Force military personnel, DoD civilian employees, or other contract staff in support of medical requirements.</p>
<p>Clinical Support Services can be any occupation that engages in direct patient care activities such as physicians, nurses, medical technicians, pharmacists and laboratory professionals for short or long term staffing needs. Services may be required at any government facility overseas or they may be performed in contractor owned facilities.</p>
<p>In accordance with DFAR 237.104, agencies may acquire personal services contracts for health care are authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1091 to provide--<br /><br />(1) Direct health care services provided in medical treatment facilities; <br />(2) Health care services at locations outside of medical treatment facilities (such as the provision of medical screening examinations at military entrance processing stations); and<br />(3) Services of clinical counselors, family advocacy program staff, and victim's services representatives to members of the Armed Forces and covered beneficiaries who require such services, provided in medical treatment facilities or elsewhere. Persons with whom a personal services contract may be entered into under this authority include clinical social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and other comparable professionals who have advanced degrees in counseling or related academic disciplines and who meet all requirements for State licensure and board certification requirements, if any, within their fields of specialization.</p>
<p>Medical Administrative Support Services can include any occupations that support the operations of the medical facility such as appointing, coding, medical records, transcription, referral/utilization management and clerical support. The program may also include highly technical positions such as biomedical equipment repair technicians, industrial hygiene technicians and materials handlers. These positions may include short or long term assignments based on staffing needs. Services may be required at any government facility overseas or they may be performed in contractor owned facilities.</p>
<p>Advisory &amp; Assistance Services can include; project managers, analysts, subject matter experts, consultants, program integrators, beneficiary counselors, patient administration specialists, medical financial advisors, healthcare administrators, group practice managers and support in the areas of division planning, programming, operations, public relations and human capital management, clerical, technical, and oversight. Services may be required at any government facility overseas or they may be performed in contractor owned facilities.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 37.2, agencies may contract for advisory and assistance services, when essential to the agency's mission, to --<br />(1) Obtain outside points of view to avoid too limited judgment on critical issues;<br />(2) Obtain advice regarding developments in industry, university, or foundation research;<br />(3) Obtain the opinions, special knowledge, or skills of noted experts;<br />(4) Enhance the understanding of, and develop alternative solutions to, complex issues;<br />(5) Support and improve the operation of organizations; or<br />(6) Ensure the more efficient or effective operation of managerial or hardware systems.</p>
<p>Currently, these services are typically procured, when needed, by each facility using; a local base contracting office, other contracting offices at other bases, centralized contracts, and other non-agency contracts. The AFMSCC seeks to develop a long term contract vehicle to satisfy demand by establishing pre-priced labor categories so facilities may place orders as needs arise. By leveraging resources, defining common requirements and specifications, we will simplify the acquisition process and reduce the lead time in the ordering process for the requesting location. There has not been any determination concerning the number, scope and geographic coverage of requirements associated with this area of interest.</p>
<p>The AFMSCC seeks to learn from industry the ability of vendors to perform in multiple NAICS in multiple countries. Preliminary research suggests that the scope of the contracts might exceed the capabilities of small business; however, we seek large and small business respondents who are currently conducting business or providing services outside the United States or are interested in doing so. The input will help us ascertain the interest, capability, and capacity of all potential offerors. Reviews of available North American Industrial Classification (NAICS) codes/ spend (3 year average annual receipts) states:</p>
<p>&bull;541611 - Administrative Management and GeneralManagement Consulting Services/$14M<br />&bull;621999 - All Other Miscellaneous Ambulatory Health Care Services/$10M<br />&bull;622110 - General Medical and Surgical Hospitals/$34.5M</p>
<p>We are seeking comments on our NAICS code selection as well.</p>
<p>If you are an interested large or small business, please complete the attached questionnaire http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/6BSK7JK . Completing this survey will provide the name, phone number, and e-mail address of a company representative that the Government may contact for additional information.</p>
<p>Notice: The Air Force has non-government employees (i.e. contractor employees) assisting with its market research. These non-government employees, who have all signed nondisclosure agreements, will have access to industry responses.</p>
<p>Information gained through this RFI will be used to further define the AFMS requirements. Interested parties are urged to monitor the official Government Point of Entry at www.fedbizopps.gov for future announcements regarding AFMS needs. It is the responsibility of interested parties to check this site regularly for any changes or updates. Vendors can subscribe to the FedBizOpps Vendor Notification Service to receive emails notifying them of all notices for a particular solicitation number, all notices from selected organizations and product service classifications (NAICS codes) or all procurement notices.

This service is provided for convenience only and does not serve as a guarantee of notification. Subscribers to this list service are ultimately responsible for reviewing the Federal Business Opportunities site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions.</p>

<DESC>Buckley Air Force Base (BAFB), located in Aurora, Colorado is conducting a market survey with the intent of determining an acquisition strategy which would best meet the laundry needs (commercial appliances 60 washers &amp; 80 dryers located in two different buildings) for base dormitory residents. In addition to finding the best strategy, we also have the intent on determining the interest, capabilities and qualifications of potential small businesses with providing the services our evaluation shows would be the best value for the Government. <br />BAFB is exploring several different scenarios to determine which direction it should go in satisfying the washers and dryers maintenance and repair needs. The first scenario is to purchase the washers and dryers we currently lease. The Government would then have to procure a maintenance contract to service the washers and dryers for five (5) years. <br />The second scenario would be to replace half of the washers and a quarter of the dryers in the first year then to replace the others throughout the life of the contract. This approach would require the Government to lease the appliances, inclusive of a maintenance agreement. <br />Scenario One: BAFB is nearing the end of a 5-year lease/service contract. The contract includes the option to purchase the current units at the end of the lease. We would seek an appliance maintenance contract for repair services with the possibility of including a cost reimbursable contract line item numbers (CLINs) to replace units that are no longer economical cost efficient to repair. See Performance Work Statement (PWS) for further information concerning this scenario. <br />Scenario Two: Establish a new lease/service contract. The units provided will be new and in accordance with the PWS. The Contractor will be required to install the new washer and dryer units, provide all the necessary installation material, and accessories for full functionality of the appliances. Upon the end of the contract, the furnished units shall be removed from the base by the Contractor. The Government will provide periodic inspection of the units as deemed necessary. The Contractor is required to repair and/or replace any units within 48 hours of notification as stated within the PWS. <br />The Contractor shall be required to provide all labor, materials, tools and equipment in order to provide and perform either scenario to the Government as a PRIME Contractor for a potential firm fixed-price contract for one (1) base period plus four (4) option periods. A firm requirement based on the two (2) scenarios has not yet been established (see attached draft PWS).

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice (Market Survey)US Army RDECOM-ARDEC-METC ACC-NJ-ET, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey 07806-5000
Modernization of Solvent Propellant Lines at Radford Army Ammunition Plant (RFAAP)  Response Date: 15 April 2012  The Army Contracting Command, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey, on behalf of U.S. Army Research Development Engineering Command  Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (RDECOM-ARDEC) is conducting a Market Survey, as the United States Army is contemplating the modernization of the single and multi base solvent gun propellant production lines at Radford Army Ammunition Plant (RFAAP), located in Radford, VA. The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to identify proven technologies and processes for single and multi-base solvent propellant production.   The current production lines produce 5.25M lbs/year of solvent single base propellants and 3.9M lbs/year of solvent multi-base propellants. Ether, alcohol and/or acetone are used as solvents during production and several operation including dehydration, mixing, pressing, cutting and coating are also performed. The anticipated benefits of the modernization are: an environmentally compliant process and improved propellant uniformity, process control, safety, maintainability, and flexibility that will support production of propellants having multiple formulations and geometries, including stick propellant. In addition, a reduction of energy consumption, waste generation, cycle times, labor requirements and facility footprint are also expected benefits.  The ultimate goal would be to identify the best technology available to produce solvent gun propellant and utilize this technology in whole or in part to modernize the existing solvent facility at Radford Army Ammunition Plant, in order to reduce the overall manufacturing cost, improve process safety and enhance product quality.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government, all information as provided will not be returned. Information provided will not be shared with third parties outside of the U.S. Government. Firms or companies responding to this Sources Sought (Market Survey) should provide a summary of their companys capabilities including a description of their facilities, personnel, past experience, specifications, brochures, manuals, reports, demonstration video and other technical data required to justify your ability to support this modernization effort.

<ARCHDATE>06122012
<CONTACT>Allison Griffin, 508-233-4495

<a href="mailto:allison.griffin@us.army.mil">ACC-APG - Natick (PADDS)</a>
<DESC>The US Army Research Development Engineering Command, Natick Soldier Research, Development & Engineering Center (NSRDEC), is conducting a market survey for technical information to provide machinery for the expansion of paper honeycomb core into Energy Dissipation Pads (EDPs) at forward operating locations.  Currently, the only medium used for cargo airdrop ground impact energy dissipation is paper honeycomb.  Paper honeycomb comes in sheets that are 8 feet long, 3 feet wide and 3 inches thick, and is otherwise referred to as EDPs. Given that EDP is more than 95% air by volume, it is extremely inefficient to ship and store.  <br>Because of the remote and involved nature of the conflict in Afghanistan in particular, the demand for airdrops is at record highs. Consequently, EDP shipping expenses are climbing and storage space in airdrop staging points is filling up.  To alleviate challenges presented by these unprecedented strategic airdrop numbers, machinery to produce EDPs as close as possible to their location of use is being sought. <br><br>Of particular interest is the private sector's practice of shipping bulk paper honeycomb core and expanding the core where the honeycomb panels are desired.  This process begins with the creation of compressed honeycomb called honeycomb "core."  This airless configuration of honeycomb is shipped to various facilities where the core is expanded and plied with paper on the top and bottom in a process called "paneling."  The machine that panels honeycomb core is called a "Panel Line."  <br><br>The intended deliverable of this project is to attain a "turn-key" paper honeycomb panel line that is containerized and capable of being shipped to forward locations where EDPs will be produced and used.   The containerized honeycomb panel line and raw materials shall be capable of producing EDPs that meet current honeycomb standards outlined in MIL-PRF-9884F.  Beyond the threshold of providing the standard 96"x36"x3" honeycomb, machines capable of producing 44 inch-wide honeycomb in order to accommodate rigging of high-demand CDS bundles would be desired in order to provide this objective capability as part of a future effort.  The machine shall be capable of a continuous production rate of at least 60 feet per minute.  One of the major problems with continuous production honeycomb expansion machines is the maintenance actions required for the glue applicator.  If the machine is going to be idle for more than 20 minutes, the glue applicator drums that apply glue to the expanded core for paper panel lamination need to be cleaned with running water and detergent.  Due to the harsh and remote climates that the expansion machine may have to operate in, running water will not always be available, and cycle / shut down times will often exceed 20 minutes.  To mitigate the glue maintenance problem, a honeycomb panel line which utilizes an adhesive-backed paper is desired in order to eliminate the need for glue applicators and their cleaning and maintenance all together.  The resultant EDP must also meet the requirements of MIL-PRF-9884F. Sources capable of making or providing i.e., lease and support the machine(s) (to include core and material (paper/glue)) to above specification are sought.<br><br>NSRDEC is seeking sources, technical and product information for products which meet the DoD requirements, or may meet requirements with modifications. Proprietary information will not be disclosed outside of the U.S. government. All interested firms, regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this Request for Information (RFI). This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for information solicited. No awards will result from this request. Firms responding to this RFI shall bear all risk and expense of any resources used to provide the requested information, and all information submitted in response to this request shall become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter. Respondents must submit their product brochures, technical data, or other information concerning performance and cost by 13 April 2012.  Responses may be sent via email to william.millette@us.army.mil or by regular mail to US Army RDECOM, Natick Soldier RD&E Center, ATTN: RDNS-WPA-D (Millette), Kansas Street, Natick, MA 01760-5017.<br><br>This market survey is for information and planning purposes only.  This is not an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be taken as a commitment by RDECOM-NSRDEC.

The standards must include the linkage of essential job tasks to the identification of the required physical abilities (e.g., muscular strength, aerobic capacity, anaerobic power) and the physical requirements, (e.g., lift 50 lbs., drag a 150 lb. individual for 25 feet.).</p>
<p>The standards must identify the physical performance constructs being assessed and related job specific validation evidence (e.g., content, criterion-related, and/or construct) that substantiates the use of the measures and CBP's ability to fully defend both scientifically and legally the utilization of the standards.</p>
<p>The physical fitness standards must include the protocol(s) for administering the physical fitness tests in an office, field and/or academy setting and the training materials necessary to successfully follow and complete the protocol(s). The tests must be graded pass/fail and include the specific justification for the test selection, identified cut scores, and scoring protocol.</p>
<p>The development of medical standards includes the identification of the specific medical requirements, the content of the medical examination protocol, the required assessment test(s) and measures, training materials necessary to administer the examination protocol, and guidelines pertaining to the need for specialty evaluations.

The vendor must include the medical basis to support and explain the specific qualification(s) or to explain the specific disqualifying requirements, a written description of the medical criteria necessary to show the level, the nature and stability of the diagnoses, impairments, and/or conditions. The medical standards must include a detailed description of any qualifying and disqualifying diagnoses, impairments, conditions, and requirements reflective of a full medical systems review (e.g., neurological, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hearing, vision, psychiatric, organ transplantation, prosthetic devices, cardiac/orthopedic implant devices, and medication regimens).</p>
<p>In addition to providing information concerning the capability to support the above requirements, the vendor should provide detailed information addressing the items below.</p>
<p>a. Labor categories utilized, hourly rates, and the approximate hours necessary to support all these requirements and itemized per study phase, (e.g., job analysis, development of physical fitness standards, development of medical standards).</p>
<p>b. What is the typical staffing and credentialing of personnel utilized to develop the medical standards.</p>
<p>c. What is the typical staffing and educational credentialing of the Industrial Organizational (IO) Psychologists utilized to conduct the job studies. What is their experience with conducting job studies with law enforcement personnel and their experience conducting studies to develop physical fitness and medical standards.</p>
<p>d. The approximate timeframe to complete the job study and the individual study phases, (e.g., job analysis, development of physical fitness standards, development of medical standards).</p>
<p>e. List of Other Direct Costs (ODC) typically associated with performing these requirements.</p>
<p>f. If a subcontractor(s) is utilized, what types of services are provided by the primary vendor and what types of services are provided by the subcontractor(s).</p>
<p>g. Provide commercial practices pertaining to receipt of payment for work effort (e.g., monthly invoicing, invoice submitted after acceptance of final deliverable(s), payment made in conjunction with project milestones).</p>
<p>h. What challenges are frequently present when conducting job studies and are there any unique challenges when conducting job studies for Federal law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>i. Identify general pricing concerns pertaining to labor, travel, materials, direct costs or other direct costs.</p>
<p>j. Sanitized samples of previously issued technical reports, reflective of the job analysis, development of physical fitness standards, and the development of medical standards.</p>
<p>k. Location of the vendor, any subcontractors and staffing personnel.</p>
<p>l. Socioeconomic status of the business (e.g., SBA Classification).</p>
<p>m. Independent of completing a full job study for the development of physical fitness standards, if CBP was to internally complete the job analysis and the data collection for the physical fitness standards, what are the probable labor categories, hourly rates, and approximate hours necessary to just complete the reporting analysis phase to produce a technical report for the development and validation of the physical fitness standards.</p>
<p>n. Independent of completing a full job study for the development of medical standards, what are the probable labor categories, hourly rates and approximate hours necessary if CBP was to entertain medical or management consultation services for policy development, revision of any medical standards, review of occupational health issues, and completion of independent medical examinations.</p>
<p>o. Since the government's data rights allows for CBP, the Department of Homeland Security and/or the Office of Personnel Management to reproduce, create derivative works, and make public any technical writings and materials as needed, related to the job analysis, development of physical fitness, and/or medical standards, identify any potential proprietary or copyright assertion issues which may be in conflict with the government's rights.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>RATING WRITTEN ESSAY TESTS FOR <br />U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is responsible for the development and implementation of assessments for entry-level selection, career development, and promotion into its mission-critical occupations. Through its shared-services agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS), CBP is also responsible for the development and implementation of such assessments for mission-critical occupations in these two bureaus.</p>
<p>For selection into the GS-5 through GS-12 grade levels of the ICE Criminal Investigator position, the best applicants who qualify for the jobs are required to take a written essay test. CBP requires that these essay tests be evaluated by experts in English language writing skills.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>CBP is responsible for providing the Contractor with the applicant essays. In addition, CBP will provide rating criteria to the Contractor and will provide guidance on the CBP rating and documentation processes. The Contractor shall rate the written essays, and provide CBP with the rated and documented results.</p>
<p>Task 1. Kick-Off Meeting and In Progress Reviews (IPRs)</p>
<p>Subtask 1.1. Kick-Off Meeting. Within 15 days of contract award, the Contractor shall attend the Kick-Off meeting to discuss the contract, and ensure that all parties share the same level of understanding with respect to the goals, requirements, and complexities of the project. The Kick-Off meeting will be held at CBP headquarters, Washington, DC, but may be attended via teleconference or video-conference.</p>
<p>Subtask 1.2. Project Reporting Information. The Contractor's Project Manager or representative approved by the CBP Contracting Officer Representative (COR) shall report the status of the project and the contracted dollar balance monthly via an invoice stating the number of essays rated and the total cost during any month that essays are rated. During these time frames, CBP representatives, and the Contractor representative(s) shall convene monthly to review and discuss the status and quality of the completed work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Task 2. Rating Written Essays</p>
<p>The Contractor shall rate all of the written essays for one open testing period; the exact dates shall be determined by CBP. CBP will notify the contractor via email two weeks prior to forwarding each batch of essays to the vendor. CBP is responsible for providing the Contractor with the essays and the rating forms. The CBP COR shall have final approval in the review and evaluation process of the scored essay materials.</p>
<p>Subtask 2.1. The Contractor shall rate the essays (i.e., a one-page document) using two raters, who, by using the rating and documentation criteria provided by CBP, shall determine the appropriate rating. Each rater shall independently rate each essay and the final rating shall be determined by a consensus agreement of the two raters. Each rater shall give each essay an overall rating as well as ratings in four factor areas, which will be in the rating criteria provided by CBP. Raters shall provide documentation of the reasons for the given rating in a manner that comports with the rating criteria and documentation format established by CBP. If the two assigned raters do not agree on the final rating, the Contractor shall provide a third rater to break the tie and documentation will be required in the same manner as for any final rating.</p>
<p>Subtask 2.2. The Contractor shall keep test materials secure: (1) by ensuring that all hard copies of essays and test booklets be kept in a safe or locked file cabinet except when in use for rating purposes or for mailing. The safe or locked file cabinet should have limited access to only those individuals who are assigned by the Contractor for this work; and (2) by adhering to the specific mailing procedures described below. The Contractor shall agree to return to the CBP COR all copies of the essays, test booklets, and rating materials at the end of each testing period. The Contractor shall describe how they will accomplish keeping the test materials secure. Mailing costs shall be assumed by CBP and the method of mailing shall always be an overnight express, trackable mailing service.</p>
<p>Secure Mailing Procedures:<br />&bull; All packages shall be double wrapped. That is, essays or test booklets being shipped will be enclosed in an envelope or box and sealed, with the following written on it "To be opened by addressed only" and "Sensitive." That envelope or box shall then be put into another envelope or box with the mailing label on the outside and a copy of the mailing label on the inside. Above the mailing label write "To be opened by addressee only" but do NOT write "Sensitive" on this exterior box. All box or envelope seals must be reinforced with mailing tape even if the box or envelope has self-seal end flaps.<br />&bull; The tracking number should be emailed to the CBP representative on the day of mailing. <br />&bull; Packages will never be left unattended or put in a drop box but, instead, hand delivered to the express service's representative.</p>
<p><br />3.0 DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>Within two weeks of receipt of a battery of essays, the Contractor shall return to CBP via next-day tracked mail, the essays and associated rating forms along with an electronic score report giving the tester's name, associated unique applicant identifier, the scores on each of the four factors for each rater, and the overall rating for each applicant in the battery. The score report shall be transmitted to the CBP COTR or designee electronically via e-mail in a password protected file. The Contractor shall have the capability to receive materials daily or to receive data batches from the accumulation of several days of testing.</p>
<p><br />4.0 PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</p>
<p>The performance period of this contract covers a 12-month base period beginning date of award, and four one-year option periods. Option years shall be exercised at the discretion of the Government and if funding is available.</p>
<p><br />5.0 LEVEL OF EFFORT AND COSTS</p>
<p>CBP will administer as many as 3,500 tests during one testing period. The contractor shall be capable of rating the maximum number (3,500) within a two-week period. The Contractor shall provide a firm-fixed price cost estimate for receipt, rating, and return packaging of one essay.</p>
<p><br />6.0 TRAINING OF CONTRACTOR STAFF</p>
<p>CBP shall provide specialized training in the CBP rating and documentation process to the Contractor. All training shall be provided via teleconference.</p>
<p><br />7.0 STAFFING</p>
<p>The Contractor shall possess extensive expertise in rating essay tests. With regard to rating essay tests, the Contractor shall meet the following requirements.</p>
<p>The raters of the essay tests shall have professional experience in rating essay examinations that are designed to measure English language writing skills such as professional teaching or editing experience. Such writing skills shall reflect writing composition skills that are appropriate for a formal setting. Specific details regarding the type of writing shall be conveyed in the rater training provided by CBP. The raters shall have acquired at least three years of specialized experience in rating such examinations. The Contractor shall agree to protect all materials by having each rater or person handling the essays or test booklets or assigned to this project in any way sign a Security Agreement Form (attached in Appendix A). The Contractor shall provide these forms to the COR or CBP designee for each of their employees in advance of all work.</p>

This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. All responses received within 15 calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

Date of determination is date product is generated.  Other requests for this document(s) shall be referred to the attention of the FOLAV Security Manager, G2, US ARMY TACOM (LCMC), 6501 East 11 Mile Rd, Warren, Mail Stop #105, MI 48397-5000, Commercial (586) 282-5604.<br><br>1.Background:  The Light Armored Vehicle Recovery variant (LAV-R) is equipped with 6 work/flood lamp assemblies: two vehicle mounted assemblies (Commercial Item Description A-A-52498) and two dual lamp tripod assemblies (drawing 2624346).  The vehicle mounted assemblies are powered by two 25 foot cables and the tripods by two 50 foot cables (drawing 2624687).  These lamp assemblies provide additional lighting for stationary operations and are stowed when not in use.  There are two designated 28V power ports on the vehicle's power source for cable connection.   With limited power ports, only one of the following configurations can be in use at one time: <br><br>a.Two vehicle mounted lamp assemblies.<br>b.One vehicle mounted assembly and one lamp tripod assembly.<br>c.Two lamp tripod assemblies.<br><br>2.Problem: The current system appears to be original to the vehicle but cannot function as intended.<br><br>a.The power cable configuration (drawing 2624687) supplied with the dual lamp tripod assembly does not connect to the rigger's control panel power port.  The power cable is terminated with a 2630513-8 type connector and the panel only accepts a CIR06G2-14S-7P-F80 type connector.  This prevents the use of the lamp tripod assembly.<br><br>b.The two ports on the vehicle's power source are on a dedicated 15 amperes vehicle circuit.  All six lamp assemblies described above use a common, 5.8 amperes, PAR46 lamp.  The current draw needed to operate one vehicle mounted assembly and one lamp tripod assembly or two lamp tripods exceed the circuit's capability.<br><br>3.Objective:  Provide the government with supporting data that displays industry's ability to meet the following objectives:<br><br>a.Allow for the individual operation of each of the following configurations without exceeding 15 amperes:<br>      i.The use of two vehicle mounted lamp assemblies.<br>     ii.The use of one vehicle mounted lamp assembly and one lamp tripod.<br>    iii.The use of two lamp tripods.<br>b.Connect to the vehicle's power source without modification.<br>c.Utilize the existing lamp assembly housing (i.e. PAR46 replacement) or provide a lamp assembly replacement that fits the current flood lamp assembly support (drawing 2624344).<br><br>4. Proprietary Information: The United States Government (USG) acknowledges its obligations under Federal Acquisition Regulation (18 U.S.C 1905) to protect confidential information provided to the Government. Pursuant to this statute, the USG is willing to accept any trade secrets or proprietary restrictions placed upon qualifying data forwarded in response to this RFI and to protect such information from unauthorized disclosure, subject to the following:<br>-Qualifying data must be clearly marked PROPRIETARY and be accompanied by an explanatory text so that the Government is clearly notified as to exactly what data so qualifies. <br>-Mark only data that is truly confidential.<br>-Do not mark data that is already in the public domain or is already in the possession of the USG or third parties on an unclassified basis.<br>-Proprietary data transmitted electronically must have the PROPRIETARY legend on both the cover and the transmittal e-mail, as well as at the beginning of the file. <br>-Proprietary information contained within the correspondence shall use the legends: "PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."<br><br>5. Disclaimer: The USG is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Nor is the Government obligated to like data in possession of third parties or for data which is afterwards placed in the public domain by the contractor or by third parties through no fault of the USG. Should the USG need to reproduce the protected data for distribution purposes between Government offices, all Government personnel provided with protected information will, prior to receiving copies of such information, sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement, which alerts personnel of the confidential nature of the information being provided, as well as the seriousness of the Government's obligations to protect such information.<br>6.

<SUBJECT>59--MARKET RESEARCH AND REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR SAASM-BASED POSITIONING, NAVIGATION AND TIMING DEVICES
<SOLNBR>PDGPSPNT2011
<ARCHDATE>03222012
<CONTACT>Michelle A. Timmons, 410-306-4027

<a href="mailto:michelle.a.timmons.civ@mail.mil">DLA Aberdeen (ACC-APG)</a>
<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI) not a request for proposal (RFP). The US Army Product Director, Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PD PNT) is seeking sources to provide a family of PNT solutions for US Army and Joint Service applications.  The common component of these items is a SAASM-based GPS receiver.<br><br>This RFI identifies multiple capabilities and interested parties are invited to respond to any or all of the PNT devices described below, or any portion of the devices described below.  The target date for contract award varies by the item described based on complexity of concept. <br><br>1) PNT HUB PHASE I  <br>     A sealed enclosure containing a SAASM-based GPS receiver for terrestrial applications (host platform) with connectors for external power, antenna and electrical interfaces.  Specific aerial applications may also be considered.  PNT Hub Phase I is intended to mimic the functionality of an AN/PSN-13A Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR) and not require any changes to host platform software currently utilizing DAGR as an external source of PNT data.  The connectors and external data interfaces shall be of the standard design utilized by DAGR such that the PNT Hub can effectively substitute for DAGR in a DAGR mount and connect to DAGR accessory cables. <br><br>     PNT Hub Phase I shall route PNT data for external devices with a minimum threshold of up to 3; objective up to 4.  A technical document identifying the sub-set of standard DAGR Performance Specification (PRF) and Interface Control Document (ICD) applicable to PNT Hub Phase I is TBD.  This subset of technical documents is estimated to be 80% of the current full PRF and ICD.<br>Desired Product Availability - FY12.<br>   <br>2) PNT HUB PHASE II<br> A sealed enclosure containing a SAASM-based GPS receiver for terrestrial and potential aerial applications.  Connectors for external power, antenna and multiple electrical interfaces including Ethernet such that it can provide PNT capability on a host platform(s).  The PNT Hub Phase II would incorporate circuitry to prioritize and route PNT data with a minimum threshold of 6, objective greater than 6 external devices.  PNT capability enhancements are envisioned, to include, but not limited to:  precise timing devices (ie. chip scale atomic clock), inertial measurement units, external augmentation software, Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna/Anti-Jam antenna integration, etc.<br><br>     It is acknowledged that the PNT Hub Phase II may require modification of host platform software to accommodate the shared PNT source.  A technical document identifying the standard Performance Specification (PRF) and Interface Control Document (ICD) applicable to PNT Hub Phase II is TBD.  The technical documents for PNT Hub Phase II will maintain the basic PNT functionality.  A COTS wireless interface (WiFi/Bluetooth) is contemplated for output of PNT data to external devices.<br> Desired Product Availability - FY14 or prior.<br> <br>3) EMBEDDABLE GPS RECEIVER IN MINI-GROUND BASED RECEIVER APPLICATIONS MODULE (MINI-GB-GRAM)<br>  <br>     A chip-mounted SAASM-based GPS receiver that can be integrated/embedded to a host platform mother board or delivered (optionally) installed to a circuit card such that it can substitute for an SSI-GB-GRAM in the Type II SSI form factor.  GRAM is an open architecture specification that provides a non-proprietary definition of hardware and software for embeddable SAASM-based GPS receivers. The current production item is the Small Serial Interface (SSI) GB-GRAM.  The Mini-GB-GRAM would supplement not replace the current production item and is intended for application that cannot be supported by the SSI-GB-GRAM due to size constraints.  The nominal dimensions of Mini-GB-GRAM are not to exceed 1.5 x 1.5 inches.<br><br>     The delivery option provides the opportunity to order Mini-GB-GRAM in a form factor that can substitute for current production item but not be limited to current design or interface parameters.  A technical document identifying the sub-set of standard GB-GRAM Performance Specification (PRF) and Interface Control Document (ICD) applicable to Mini-GB-GRAM is TBD.  This subset of technical documents are estimated to be 60% of the current full PRF and ICD.  The potential for a family of products to support terrestrial, aerial and precision guided munitions domains are envisioned.  Separate products to support separate domains are acceptable.  <br> Desired Product Availability - FY14 or prior.<br> <br>4) SAASM INTEGRATION TO COMMERCIAL SMARTPHONE<br>PD PNT seeks input on how best to integrate SAASM to commercial smartphones, e.g., a cradle containing SAASM that would physically connect to a smartphone or a separate device containing SAASM that would interface wirelessly to the smartphone. <br>Key factors: <br><br> 	Use of IS-GPS-153 (open architecture) data constructs<br> 	Full IS-GPS-153 compliant messages is a desired feature<br> 	Use of commercial open architecture wired or wireless interfaces<br>             ~USB <br>             ~Bluetooth or WiFi <br> 	Wireless interface must support encryption<br> 	Smartphone OS is Android open source<br> 	A Droid app to interface with & control  the SAASM module is desired  <br>Desired Product Availability - FY14 or prior.<br> <br>This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an Invitation to Bid, Request for Quotation or Request for Proposal.  Additionally there is no obligation on the part of the government to acquire any products described in this RFI.  Your response to this RFI will be treated only as information for the Government to consider.  You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.

5)	Provide professional direction and mentorship to staff physicians, residents, physician assistants and nurse practitioners.

6)	As scheduled by mutual agreement, provide services in the operating room (OR) located at the JHQ VAMC.  These services are to cover the regular OR schedule and emergencies or specialty needs.

11)	Contractor shall not under any circumstances charge VA beneficiaries or their insurance companies for services rendered by the contractor even if VA does not pay for those services.  This provision shall survive the termination or ending of the contract.

12)	Contractor will provide emergency on-call coverage after normal duty hours (4:30 PM - 7:45 AM) and weekends when the JHQ VAMC orthopedic surgeon is not on call.  The on-call schedule will be arranged between the JHQ VAMC's Chief Orthopedic Section or designee and the Contractor.

Under FAR Part 6.302-2, the current contract provider, Appalachian Orthopaedic Associates of Johnson City, is the only party who can ensure continuity of essential medical services pending the solicitation and award of a long-term contract for these services.  A Request for Information (RFI), VA249-11-RO-0203, was previously posted and the only responses received were from temporary service providers desiring to place temporary physicians on an FTE basis rather than providers able to perform services on a per-procedure basis as is required.  Additional time is required to prepare a proper solicitation and award a long-term contract for provision of these services.  It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued as soon as possible after the end of Fiscal Year 12.  

The NAICS code associated with this requirement is 621111 with a size standard of $10 million.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for Expressions of Interest (EOI), proposals, or quotations.  No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries will be accepted.  No contract award will be made on the basis of EOIs, proposals, or quotations received in response to this Notice.  This Notice of Intent is not a request for competition.  However, any company that feels they can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer 10 days from the date of publication of this Notice.  Interested persons should furnish detailed data concerning their capabilities to provide services sought, including pricing data and technical data sufficient enough to determine that a comparable source to the government is available.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  Information may be sent to carol.franklin@va.gov or via facsimile to Carol Franklin at (615) 225-5432.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the Department of Veterans Affairs will proceed with a sole source award for the requirement to Appalachian Orthopaedic Associates of Johnson City.

<DESC><p>So that NRC can finalize its market research and determine an appropriate acquisition strategy for a follow-on contract, the NRC's, Office of Administration, Division of Contracts intends to negotiate and award a sole source contract extension to Contract No. NRC-33-08-389 with Federal Consulting, Inc., for continuation of highly important Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Analyst Support Services. The NRC's Office of Information Services, Information and Records Services Division, Information Services Branch has primary responsibility for the reviewed fulfillment of all FOIA requests submitted to the agency. The proposed extension will maintain continuity of FOIA analyst support services pending finalization of the acquisition strategy and conducting of the procurement process for a follow-on contract. The extension will consist of a four (4) month period of performance with two (2) potential three-month option periods. The performance period to be covered by this extension will begin on April 1, 2012. <br /><br />The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this contract extension is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, which provides for limiting competition in those situations where only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. No source other than the incumbent can satisfy this short-term need given the transition period that would be required, and conducting a foll-ow-on acquisition for this need would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.</p>

<CONTACT>Patrick Duggins, 502-315-6187

<a href="mailto:patrick.j.duggins@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Louisville</a>
<DESC>The Government is currently leasing Building 1990 at Scott Air Force Base, an approximately 75,000 square foot two-story modular facility for the US Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) under contract W912QR-06-C-0049. Contract W912QR-06-C-0049 was awarded in August 2006 to Veteran-Pacific JV in the total contract amount of $20.1 million under an 8(a) competitive solicitation. Contract W912QR-06-C-0049 is currently in the 5th year lease which ends 30 June 2012. The proposed action is to award a new five year lease contract. The intent is to award a Base year and four (4) option years to keep this facility for USTRANSCOM and Air Mobility Command (AMC). The scope of the contract will also include maintenance and allow for necessary renovations to meet users' requirements over the next five years.<br><br>USTRANSCOM and AMC currently have requirements for temporary modular space of the same size that is currently provided under contract W912QR-06-C-0049. The need is projected to extend through 2017. There are no other facilities on Scott AFB that can meet the USTRANSCOM requirements. The intent is to award to Dominion Federal, the owner of the facility. Dominion Federal is a subcontractor to Veteran-Pacific JV under contract W912QR-06-C-0049. The 30 June 2012 contract expiration does not allow sufficient time to solicit, compete and award a new action and possible erect a new modular facility. In addition, any break in continuity of operation would impact the mission of and be unacceptable to USTRANSCOM and AMC. Keeping this modular facility in place is the only viable option. The expected time to construct a new modular facility is nine (9) months after contract award. USTRANSCOM would have to displace critical war time functions to other existing spaces that are not equipped or readily available. This displacement would have a major impact on national security. The timeframe for constructing new lease facilities to minimize impacts to on-going mission requirements, and the cost to disassemble the existing facility and reassemble a new facility make going to a competitor neither cost effective nor time effective. The only alternative is to competitively solicit a new modular lease contract. This alternative cannot be acquired in time to meet mission requirements.<br><br>Authority cited: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."<br>

<SUBJECT>Telemedicine-Enabled Combat Causualty Monitor
<SOLNBR>M6785412R9005
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL), Expeditionary Medicine branch, is seeking to continue previous development that was conducted by the U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), Joint Medical Distance Support and Evacuation (JMDSE), and the Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) on the TEMPUS-IC Professional that was selected by the USJFCOM and other sponsoring operational commands of the JMDSE JCTD as the primary remote-distance  physiological monitoring and telemedicine device for the JMDSE JCTD.

2.0  BACKGROUND.  Because casualty monitoring and telemedicine technology is maturing rapidly; the use of these devices as evacuation monitoring assets during Enhanced Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) Operations (EMO) needs to be investigated further.
  

The proposed contractor for this action is Remote Diagnostics Technology (RDT) Limited.  RDT is the designer, developer, and Original Equipment Manufacturing (OEM) source for the TEMPUS-IC and the military version TEMPUS-IC Professional. 

To date, RDT has provided approximately twenty-five (25) TEMPUS-IC units to the JCTD and other commands through U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) contracts.  In addition, RDT was also awarded a BAA research grant to develop additional capabilities required by the JMDSE JCTD on the TEMPUS-IC Professional device.  The TEMPUS IC devices hardware is proprietary property of RDT Ltd.  Currently, there is no other vendors that have experience or expertise for developing new capabilities for the TEMPUS-IC.
  

3.0  TASK DESCRIPTION: 

3.1     The purchase of one TEMPUS-IC Professional patient monitor :  An advanced multi-parameter and telemedicine enabled vital signs monitor that provides a wide range of features (available upon request) to be used for testing during MCWLs scheduled experimentation: 

3.2     Integration of TEMPUS-IC Professional with Trellisware Tactical Radio:  Ability to provide real-time transmission of the vital signs data to a FOB  (Forward Operating Base) or similar site over military radio systems.  This includes the ability to integrate with the current MCWL C-4 Next Generation Command & Control (NGC2) tactical radio network to leverage existing efforts to transmit data On The Move (OTM) and Over The Horizon (OTH) and Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) voice and data capabilities at ranges greater than 200 nautical miles.
 

3.3	Integration of TEMPUS-IC Professional with Zephyr Bio-Harness:  This will add the ability of  automatic physiological data (heart rate, respiration rate, skin temperature, blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation level, single lead electrocardiogram, and motion/position indication) synchronization from the Zephyr Bio-harness with the TEMPUS-IC Professional.

	Zephyr bio-harness integration includes hardware, software, and technical support from Zephyr Technologies for seven (7) days during LOE 2.2.  

Qty	Description
4	Bluetooth Bio-harness-3 and large side strap
1	Bio-harness-3 seven bay multi charger
1	Bio-harness-3 software development kit
1	Software development support
1	On-site support during LOE 2.2 execution-7 days 
1	Shipping
Table 3.3

3.4	Addition of SMS-Style Text Messaging to the TEMPUS-IC Professional:
Ability to send/receive SMS  (Short Message Service) text messages to/from the TEMPUS-IC Professional device  and a higher level medical care facility.
 This is to be achieved using an on-screen text editor on the TEMPUS-IC Professional (controlled touch screen).  Messages are to be appended to the record of care on the TEMPUS-IC Professional and will be presented in a conversation format.

This added functionality will enable the ability of text messages to be sent back and forth from the Point of Injury (POI) and higher levels of care such as the Forward Resuscitative Surgery System (FRSS) or to/from sea-based medical assets.
 
3.5	On-Site Support.  Vendor shall provide on-site technical support for three (3) days for two (2) training events scheduled for Dahlgren, VA  22448.  These training evolutions are currently scheduled for June 13, 2012 and October 17, 2012.

3.6	Zephyr BioHarness Integration  Multi patient

The U.S.
 Army Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) proposed to fund the development of multi-patient Bioharness/Tempus integration.  The Combined use of both the Tempus IC ProfessionalTM (carried by the operator with medical responsibilities) and the BioHarnessTM for multiple patients would provide the features to allow true, real-time simultaneous multi-patient monitoring capability in the field.  

This would be achieved by:

The use of the BioHarnessTM (that would have been pre-fitted on multiple operators for operational command and control purposes) to provide heart rate, respiration, motion/position indication and a single trace of ECG, SPO2, blood pressure and identification name/number from the operator.
  

At an incident site, this data would be capable of being transmitted wirelessly in real-time using BluetoothTM communications to a Tempus IC ProfessionalTM.  

The medic arriving at/supporting the medical incident would use the Tempus IC ProfessionalTM in its capacity as a vital signs monitor (e.g. on whoever appears to be the most seriously injured patient) but would also use the Tempus as a hub through which to receive and monitor the vital signs of the other casualties.

This would be achieved using the Tempus built-in BluetoothTM link and its large daylight readable and NVG compliant touchscreen display to provide the user with a tabbed array of different patients vital signs data as well as an easy to read dashboard type display of all users on a single display.

At any time where an individual patients condition went beyond pre-set alarm thresholds, this would be automatically brought to the medics attention on the Tempus e.g.
 through a mixture of audible and visual alarms and on-screen messages.

This would also enable the medic to leverage the ReachBak (real-time telemedicine) features of the Tempus e.g. transmission of medical records over Trellisware radios and also the semi-automatic completion of TCCC Cards (Tactical Combat Casualty Care).

This scenario is illustrated in Fig 2 (See enclosure 1)..

4.0  DELIVERABLES:  Table 4.0 provides a list of the products and services to be delivered as part of this effort.

Special Notice Synopsis:

The National Acquisition Center intends to enter into a sole-source contract with Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) for the procurement of Efavirenz (Sustiva) a branded medication indicated for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus with no generic alternative.  This action is to contract for the identified drug which is currently sourced from a non-designated Trades Agreement Act (TAA) country.   Sustiva is a patented drug available only from one source, BMS, until its patent expires April 6, 2019.    This contract is necessary as Efavirenz (Sustiva) is the only agent in its class that is recommended as a preferred regimen by the Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines for the use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1 infected adults and adolescents.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals as Efavirenz (Sustiva) is protected by patent until April 6, 2019 and only available from BMS.  It is anticipated a contract will be awarded for a base and four one-year options.    All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to the email address stated herein, Attn: Youlanda.Duggar@va.gov.  The Government anticipates an award date on or before April 10, 2012.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   This solicitation and any resultant award will be processed in accordance with FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

Solicitation number W15QKN-12- R-F012  is being issued as a request for quotation (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55, effective 02 February 2012.

INSTRUCTIONS: 
Offerors responding to this announcement shall submit their quote in accordance with the attached Instructions to Offerors (Attachment 5).  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions.   Therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.   The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.


BASIS FOR AWARD:

The Government plans to award two (2) fixed price purchase orders as a result of this Request for Proposal (RFP).  Offerors can submit a proposal for either one, or both of the requirements.  Offerors submitting proposals for both requirements shall submit two (2) separate proposals, one (1) for each requirement.  The evaluation of quotes will be conducted utilizing the Tradeoff Source Selection Process in accordance with FAR 15.101-1.  In using the Tradeoff Source Selection approach, the Government seeks to award to an offeror who gives the greatest confidence that it will best meet and/or exceed the requirements.  This process allows for a tradeoff between non-cost factors and cost/price and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal or other than the highest technically rated proposal to achieve a best-value contract award.  


Award will be made to the offeror whose proposal represents the best value to the Government.  The Government intends to award two (2) purchase orders as a result of this Request for Proposal (RFP).


EVALUATION FACTORS AND EVALUATION APPROACH 

AREAS TO BE EVALUATED:

Appropriate consideration will be given to the three evaluation factors:  Technical, Past Performance and Price.  The Technical factor consists of the subfactors identified below.  There are no subfactors for Price.


Technical Subfactors:

Subfactor A: Equipment and Personnel

Subfactor B: Schedule


The Technical factor is more important than the Past Performance factor.  The Past Performance factor is significantly more important than the Price factor. The Technical subfactors are of equal importance.  


To receive consideration for award, a final rating of no less than Acceptable must be achieved for all Technical sub-factors.  The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offerors response has adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation.  The proposal will be evaluated to determine the extent to which each objective of the Statement of Objectives has been addressed in the proposal.


The evaluation process will consider the following:


1.	Factor I: Technical - Evaluation of the following technical sub-factors will specifically consider:


Technical Subfactor A - Equipment and Personnel:  The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror has personnel on hand who adequately demonstrate the level of competence and technical proficiency needed to carry out the objectives called out in the Statement of Objectives (SOO).  The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror has the equipment (or plan and schedule to obtain same) to adequately carry out the objectives listed in the SOO.


Technical Subfactor B - Schedule:  The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the offeror has clearly identified all deliverables and is capable of delivering within the specified times as established in the Contract Data Requirements List.


2.	Factor II: Past Performance - The Government shall consider demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in supplying services that meet the RFQ requirements.  There are no subfactors for Past Performance.


3.	Factor III: Price - The Government shall determine if the proposed price is fair and reasonable.  There are no subfactors for price



TECHNICAL EVALUATION:


The technical portion of the proposal will be rated by evaluating the technical proposal for strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies, combined with the risks of the proposal.  The combined technical/risk rating includes consideration of risk in conjunction with the strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies in determining technical ratings.  The technical subfactors will be rated individually and an integrated assessment will be performed to determine the overall Technical factor rating.  

	The following rating definitions will be utilized in the evaluation of the overall Technical Factor rating as well as the individual Technical sub-factors:


Color - Blue; Rating - Outstanding; Definition:  Proposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is very low.


Color - Purple; Rating - Good; Definition: Proposal meets requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful performance is low.


Color - Green; Rating - Acceptable; Definition:  Proposal meets requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract performance. Risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate.


Color - Yellow; Rating - Marginal; Definition: Proposal does not clearly meet requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more weaknesses which are not offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful performance is high.


Color - Red; Rating - Unacceptable; Definition:  Proposal does not meet requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. Proposal is unawardable.



PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION:


There are two aspects to the past performance evaluation:

1. Relevancy of a recent effort and

2. Performance level.


Relevancy shall consider similarity of service/support and complexity of a performance effort that was executed by the offeror within the last three (3) years of release of this RFP.  The following rating definitions will be utilized in the evaluation of past performance relevancy:


Rating - Relevant; Definition: Present/past performance effort involved similar scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.


Rating - Not Relevant; Definition:  Present/past performance effort involved little or none of the scope and magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.


Performance level for each identified relevant and recent effort will be assessed by the Government evaluation team based on data provided by the offeror, the offerors customers via questionnaire (RFP Attachments 6 and 7), and other data sources available to the Government.  The evaluation team will review the past performance information and determine the quality and usefulness as it applies to performance confidence assessment.  Each offeror shall be assigned one of the following performance confidence ratings:


Rating - Substantial Confidence; Definition:  Based on the offerors recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.


Rating - Satisfactory Confidence;  Definition:  Based on the offerors recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.


Rating - Limited Confidence; Definition:  Based on the offerors recent/relevant performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.


Rating - No Confidence; Definition:  Based on the offerors recent/relevant performance record, the Government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.


Rating - Unknown Confidence (Neutral); Definition:  No Recent/relevant performance record is available or the offerors performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.



PRICE EVALUATION:

The total evaluated price will be used in the best value determination.  The Government will evaluate the overall total proposed price to determine if the proposed price is fair and reasonable.  Price reasonableness will be based on competitive offers when possible.



DEFINITIONS:

Deficiency:  A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.


Strength:  Any aspect of a proposal when judged against a stated evaluation criterion, enhances the merit of the proposal or increases the probability of successful performance of the contract.


Weakness:   A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.


Proposal Risk:  Proposal risks are those risks associated with the likelihood that an Offeror's proposed approach will meet the requirements of the solicitation.


Performance Risk:  Performance risks are those risks associated with an Offeror's likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by that Offeror's record of current or past performance.


The Contracting Officer reserves the right to make no award under this solicitation.

See Statement of Work<BR><BR>Listed is some information regarding the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.  This is not the Act itself.  
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act protects migratory birds. The original 1918 statute implemented a 1916 Treaty between the U.S. and Great Britain (for Canada) for the protection of migratory birds. Later amendments implemented treaties between the U.S. and Mexico, the U.S. and Japan, and the U.S. and the Soviet Union (now Russia). Specific provisions in the statute include a Federal prohibition to "pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, attempt to take, capture or kill, possess, offer for sale, sell, offer to purchase, purchase, deliver for shipment, ship, cause to be shipped, deliver for transportation, transport, cause to be transported, carry, or cause to be carried by any means whatever, receive for shipment, transportation or carriage, or export, at any time, or in any manner, any migratory bird, included in the terms of this Convention . . . for the protection of migratory birds . . . or any part, nest, or egg of any such bird." (16 U.S.C. 703). This applies to birds included in international conventions between the U.S. and Great Britain, the U.S. and Mexico, the U.S. and Japan, and the U.S. and the Russia.
 The responsibilities of Federal agencies to protect migratory birds are set forth in Executive Order 13186. US Fish and Wildlife Service is the lead agency for migratory birds. FSA and NRCS are currently working with USFWS to establish an MOU on migratory birds in compliance with EO 13186. The birds protected under this statute are many of our most common species, as well as birds listed as threatened or endangered. View a list of birds protected by the MBTA and other related bird information.
To follow the U.S. Fish & Wildlife laws under the Migratroy Bird Treaty the Osprey birds cannon be disturbed during their breeding season from April 1 through September 1.For New Mexico, the nexting period for migratory birds is<BR><BR>Reclamation requires proof of certification for the use of any herbicides on Federal property.  Federal and states laws have to be followed.    EPA is in charge of these requirements currently, certification is required for any vendor who collects money for their services.  No restricted chemicals can be applied on Reclamation property unless permission is received from Washington DC.  Navajo Dam does not have permission to use restricted chemicals.<BR><BR>No protected species of vegetation have been located on these properties.   Our environmental group checks this out yearly, as well as other federal agencies and the public.  Navajo Dam employees are familiar with protected species.  If they are uncertain if any vegetation or bird or animal is protected, they check with our environmental group.<BR><BR>There is really no need to include a list.  No vegetation is allowed to grow on these sites.   They need to be kept as bare of vegetation, as possible.  Mainly for safety reasons, vegetation prevention is necessary because it can hide any water leaks which could cause damage to the dam.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Roche Diagnostics Corporation, 9115 Hague Road, Indianapolis, IN 46256-1025, for repair of a Roche MagNA Pure 96 unit, Serial No 1014. The 96 head pipettes unit is leaking, so that it is unable to pipette the correct volumes and needs to be repaired/replaced. The Process Head handles a volume range from 20 &mu;l up to 1500 &mu;l for aspirating, dispensing and mixing reagents and samples. The Process Head handles liquids with different viscosities, e.g., alcohol, saline buffer, 5 molar salt solutions, detergents, organic solutions and magnetic beads. It aspirates liquid from the Processing Cartridge with a dead volume &lt; 10 &mu;L and aspirates air bubbles to prevent losing drops. The repair includes all travel, repair, Roche Diagnostics parts, and quality control, and is required before the equipment can be covered by a maintenance contract. The machine is a critical instrument used for pandemic preparedness.&nbsp;CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) announces a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Functional Hinged Knee Braces. The Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). Standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected standardized vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <strong>The government is seeking a single vendor selection for this SA.<br /><br /></strong>The major facilities in the MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe (hereafter referred to as MMESOs) include but are not limited to MMESO North: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Portsmouth Naval Hospital, Womack Army Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Medical Center; MMESO South: Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, Brooke Army Medical Center, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Darnall Army Medical Center, Keesler Medical Center, Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Martin Army Community Hospital, Fort Benning, GA; MMESO West: Madigan Army Medical Center, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Naval Medical Center San Diego, Irwin Army Community Hospital, Mike O'Callaghan Federal Hospital; MMESO Pacific: Tripler Army Medical Center, 18th Medical Group, Kadena AB, Okinawa, US Naval Hospital, Yokosuka, Japan; MMESO Europe: Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, Landstuhl, GE, US Naval Hospital, Naples, Italy, and 48th Medical Group, RAF Lakenheath; and Operational U.S. Forces. This SA is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in this SA your company must have, or be in the process of obtaining, a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Region, i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/
<p>This IA standardization initiative will be a Three Phase IPP Process: vendor(s) who meets the technical / company requirements in Phase I will be invited to participate in Phase II where no-charge products will be provided for clinical evaluation and Phase III where pricing will be required for submittal. Phase II and Phase III will be run concurrently. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is August 2012.</strong> The selection will be based on the product and vendor that provides the Best Value to the enterprise. Products and vendors that meet or exceed the technical and clinical performance requirements will be considered clinically preferred products and sources. <strong>Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinically preferred standard, best price (i.e. lowest Aggregate Post Standardization Cost) will determine selection. <br />Points of Contact: Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific, Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil 808-433-3686 and Cora Toledo, Clinical Analyst, corazon.m.toledo.ctr@us.army.mil. 808-433-2894.<br /><br /></strong>B. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Functional Hinged Knee Braces. Within the MMESOs this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $609,773.36. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Based on usage data, one hundred fifty six (156) of the total one hundred fifty six (156) line items represent the top forty (40) products and account for 100% ($609,773.36) of the total volume in sales $609,773.36 in the MMESOs and are clinically significant. The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Requirements below.</p>
<p>C. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative will provide an initial response to the FBO-posted RFIAQ to Mary Summers, MMESO Pacific, Team Leader, mary.summers1@us.army.mil and Cora Toledo, Clinical Analyst, corazon.m.toledo.ctr@us.army.mil.</strong> The vendor's initial responses will include detailed information requested in the technical/company requirements listed in the FBO RFIAQ and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company Point of Contact (POC) (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); and (3) Identification of the RFIAQ to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the MMESO Pacific that their initial submissions, quote and literature arrived at the MMESO Pacific via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date / time, should a problem occur with the first submission. Vendor should complete and submit the attached document. A vendor who cannot open the attachments, may contact the POC as noted in the FBO RFIAQ and a copy will be provided via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. </strong></p>

Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection, seeking and evaluating opportunities for committed volume purchase agreements, and coordinating logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The boards are chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO AORs and include clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs. The MMESO Pacific reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if determined necessary.</p>
<p>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation<br />The MMESO CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the technical/company requirements.

<p>Sample Set<br />FUNCTIONAL HINGED KNEE BRACE FOR MULTI- LIGAMENT INSTABILITY, (ACL/MCL/LCL/PCL), Right OR UNIVERSAL KNEE, SIZE LARGE</p>
<p>Each evaluator will evaluate each product sample from each vendor against the established requirements. A trial will consist of evaluating sample products from a single vendor, evaluated against the requirements and recorded on a single evaluation form per vendor. The clinical/performance acceptability evaluation period will last for twenty-one (21) calendar days. The acceptability evaluation responses will be in a Likert scale format with a one (1) through five (5) scoring range. The scale descriptors are: one (1) Completely Unacceptable, two (2) Overwhelmingly Unacceptable, three (3) Partially Unacceptable, four (4) Acceptable, and five (5) Highly Acceptable. The MMESO JPRB has established a 4.0 as the Clinically Preferred threshold of products for standardization.</p>
<p>Vendors will be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the invitation to participate in which to make demonstration/in-service arrangements/ appointments with the participating MTFs so that the instructions are available prior to the start of the clinical evaluation in Phase II. Arrangements must be made for product samples to be delivered to participating MTFs by the scheduled in-service date. Vendors who do not make the before mentioned arrangements by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative. Vendor must send the MMESO Pacific verification regarding the dates of the in-services for the participating MTFs. The vendor must coordinate all in-services so that all MTFs are in-serviced before the evaluation starts.</p>
<p>Vendor will be allowed to be present during the in-servicing. Vendor will not be allowed to be present during the actual evaluation process of their products or their competitor's products. Vendor will not be allowed to speak to any hospital staff member regarding the product evaluation, product pricing or price related factors. A vendor who speaks and/or attempts to speak to hospital staff members regarding the product evaluations, pricing or price related factors will be disqualified from this evaluation process.</p>
<p>A vendor scoring below the clinically preferred threshold will be disqualified from selection for this standardization initiative. A vendor who has been disqualified will be notified in writing upon disqualification. Of those vendors that are qualified as clinically preferred, selection will be based on best price. Clinical / performance acceptability evaluations by the participating CPT facilities will be tabulated resulting in one score per participating MMESO per vendor. The participating MMESOs' scores by vendor will then be combined resulting in one final vendor performance evaluation score. All clinical/performance acceptability evaluations will be tabulated by the MMESO Pacific and results will be forwarded to the MMESO CPT for final review.</p>
<p>There will be approximately twelve (12) MTFs enterprise wide that will be evaluating products.</p>
<p>Clinical/Performance Requirements <br />During the acquisition planning process, the CPT approved the clinical/performance requirements outlined below. The Functional Hinged Knee Braces will be worn by the evaluator for a 5 day period.</p>
<p>1. Patient Comfort and Safety - NPSG 09 - Functional Hinged Knee Brace will be lightweight and the construction will promote patient comfort. The Functional Hinged Knee Brace must be lightweight to provide comfort, support, stability, and not feel so heavy that it is uncomfortable to wear.<br />2. Patient Comfort and Safety - NPSG 09 - Metal reinforcements are fully padded and covered. The metal reinforcements that are in contact with the skin must be fully covered to prevent skin injury, provide protection and comfort, and reduce potential chafing.<br />3. Patient Safety and Product Performance - NPSG 09 - Functional Hinged Knee Brace Hinge adjustment should allow for quick adjustments and is easily reached. The Hinged Knee Brace hinge design must allow for quick and simple access, with a hinge adjustment that is easy to reach and use allowing for patient comfort and continued usage.<br />4. Patient Safety and Product Performance - NPSG 09 - Functional Hinged Knee braces provide stability when ambulating, standing or when performing range of motion exercises. The knee braces must provide stability during ambulation, standing, or during the motions of exercises in order to prevent injury to the knee.<br />5. Patient Safety and Product Performance - NPSG 9 - The Functional Hinged Knee Brace has adjustable straps which are easy to apply and provide stability. The adjustable straps must be easily applied by the patient, and provide the stability required to maintain support to the affected knee.<br />6. Patient Safety and Product Performance - NPSG 14 and NPSG 07 - The fabric material is breathable and wicks moisture to control temperature inside the brace. The product must have lightweight and breathable padding that will reduce moisture between the knee and device to control temperature inside the brace, making it comfortable to wear, preventing skin break down, surgical site infection and/or potential pressure ulcers.</p>
<p><br />Phase III Pricing Analysis<br />Upon completion of the Phase I - Technical/Company Requirements, a vendor who is found technically acceptable will be qualified / invited to provide product samples and price discount quotes concurrently. A vendor will be given 30 calendar days from the date of pricing requests to submit IA pricing quotes in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the requirements of the MMESOs. Pricing will be submitted to MMESO Pacific and must be received by 5:00PM HST, thirty (30) calendar days after the issue date of the vendor notice to submit best price quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the specific products requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing for the products identified in this announcement (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the MMESOs). <strong>Price will be analyzed based on the projected Aggregate Post-Standardization costs for each vendor.</strong> Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be calculated for each vendor by applying the vendor's offered prices to the anticipated annual usage of the enterprise. Unmatched items will be represented in the Post-Standardization Cost at a baseline non-discounted price (current DAPA price of product with highest procurement). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Among the products and sources that were determined to be clinically preferred, the best price Aggregate Post-Standardization Cost will be selected.</span></strong> The selected Vendor of Choice will have an opportunity to provide other items beyond the minimum required product line that you would like to be considered for addition to the Incentive Agreement with a discount from DAPA. All additions will be at the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>Please email all quotes to ljohnson@cc.nih.gov<br />&emsp;<br />Background
<p>The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.</p>
<p>The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by "bridges". The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics. The new 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals. The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.</p>
<p>The Department of Clinical Research Informatics (DCRI) is responsible for the operation and management IT infrastructure that supports patient care and research. The infrastructure includes networking equipment, servers, Storage Area Networks (SANS), Virtual Tape Library, desktops, laptops, workstations on wheels (WOW), Sunray terminals, Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) applications, custom applications, and other supporting technology systems. The COTS applications both Clinical and administrative as well as custom applications are hosted on a variety of Windows and UNIX based server technologies located in the Clinical Center Data Center (CCDC).</p>
<p>The CC must meet the federally mandated HSPD-12 requirement to have smartcard (PIV) access enabled for desktop access to applications that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII). The CC utilizes a shared workstation environment and Citrix to deliver the core clinical application CRIS. The shared desktop creates a unique environment for access since our users can be CC staff and also institute staff. In 2010 the CC purchased Microsoft ExpreSSO licenses and contactless Way2Care PIV readers to meet this requirement. Because of the uniqueness of the NIH Active Directory configuration the ExpreSSO product was unable to meet our needs. Microsoft has agreed to exchange our current licenses for their Vergence product which has more flexible Active Directory requirements. <br />&emsp;<br />Purpose</p>
<p>The NIH Clinical Center is requesting services for a certified Microsoft HSG Vergence Engineer to provide Proof of Concept and implement a fully functional pilot of the Microsoft Sentillion Vergence Simplified Sign on Solution for Allscripts Sunrise Acute Care.</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>Task #1 Proof of Concept</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number: SOL-CI-12-00036Notice Type: Combined Synopsis/Solicitation
Site Gas Regulators Synopsis:  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Testing and Advanced Technology Division (TATD), and the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL) has a requirement for two stage gas regulators, with the specifications listed below.
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Refer to SOL-CI-12-00036 when responding to this request. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55. This acquisition is a total set-a-side for small business. The NAICS code is 325120, the size standard is 1,000 Employees.
Background:  The TATD (Testing and Advanced Technology Division) is modifying gas supply system in the new CTF (Cold test facility) and SC03 vehicle testing areas. To maintain consistent gas flows to these and any future sites connected to this cylinder supply location, TATD will institute a dual stage gas delivery system from the new manifold being installed in these testing locations. A dual stage gas regulator will be added inline to each gas being delivered to the two analyzer benches located in the CTF and SC03 test area. This will allow the initial gas cylinder regulator to flow at a higher pressure and secondary site regulators will correct for gas pressure fluctuation at each analyzer location and maintain a consistent gas source enabling improved gas sample readings for testing and calibration.  Specifications: The contractor shall furnish two stage gas regulators in standard brass chrome plated versions (Quantity 80) and  corrosive stainless steel versions (Quantity 20). The regulator size is critical due to the limited space available at each gas supply rack. The gas valve rack to which these regulators will be connected is only 12 inches deep and 33 inches wide.  Due to the varying gasses needed and their locations on the supplied forty gas lines the regulators size must not exceed 1-3/4" body width.  Both stages will be fitted with a gauge. First stage will be sized 0 to 500psi second stage will be sized 0-60 psi. Gauges will be constructed of appropriate material for their use. Total depth of regulator body with attached gauges must not exceed 3" over all height of regulator assembly must not exceed 6". Inlet and outlet ports will be ?" NPT thread. Due to its proximity to other regulators in the valve rack the inlet must port from the top. The outlet must port f rom the rear of the regulator. The regulator must be capable of inlet pressures up to 3000psi in case of cylinder regulator failure. The regulator output flow must be at least 10 SLPM at 25psi at an inlet pressure of 250 psi.   Regulators shall be off the shelf commercially available assembled from standard designed parts with no special machined components.  
Payment:  Payment will be made upon acceptance and submission of a properly prepared invoice from the Contractor. The Purchase Order Number assigned to this contract must appear on all invoices.  The Purchase Order Number is noted in Block #3 of Optional Form 347, "Order for Supplies or Services" to be sent to the Contractor at the time of award.
All supplies shall be provided to the EPA NVFEL located at 2565 Plymouth Rd., Ann Arbor, MI 48105 within 56 days after receipt of award. The F.O.B. point shall be destination. The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this to this acquisition. The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items is applicable and the specific evaluation criteria are as follows: (1) Technical acceptability of the item offered to meet the Government's requirement and (2) price. Award will be made on a basis of the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>The Huntington District U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement for a backhoe cab assembly and repair.  Please see attached solicitation.  This requirement is set aside 100% for small businesses.    <br><br>If the vendors are experiencing certificate problems provide them with the<br>following:<br><br>Website security and trusted certificate authorities have moved to the<br>forefront with the introduction of Internet Explorer 7.0 (IE v7.0/v8.0).<br>ASFI users who have adopted IE v7.0/v8.0 as their standard web browser may<br>have noticed an IE alert stating our ASFI root certificate was not issued by<br>a trusted certificate authority.  This statement is somewhat misleading in<br>that we incorporate the latest DoD root certificates on our ASFI website but<br>IE v7.0/v8.0 does not "recognize" those certificates as trusted since they<br>have not been installed into the web browser by the user.  The instructions<br>below will help resolve this security alert for our ASFI users when<br>accessing the ASFI website. <br><br><br><br>(1) Open Internet Explorer and go to the CA Certificate download page.<br>(http://dodpki.c3pki.chamb.disa.mil/rootca.html)<br>(2) Click the link called "Download Root CA 2 Certificate". A popup will<br>appear.<br>(3) Click "Open". The Certificate Window will appear.<br>(4) In the left frame, open the subfolders until you see the "Certificates"<br>folder. The frame on the right will display a list of certificates.<br>(5) Double-click on the "DoD Root CA 2" certificate. You'll probably see two<br>of them, so double-click the first one. A popup will appear.<br>(6) Click the "Install Certificate..." button. The Certificate Import Wizard<br>will open.<br>(7) Select the "Place all certificates in the following store" and click<br>"Browse".<br>(8) Choose "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" and click "Ok".<br>(9) Click "Next" and "Finish".<br>(10) Click the next two "Ok" buttons and close the Certificates window.<br>

<li class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Discuss      current efforts underway within the U.S. government to identify Chinese      standards-setting efforts and whether ongoing oversight is underway.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, identify specific U.S.      governmental efforts to address this issue, and identify any successful      efforts that have occurred and assess the government&rsquo;s future prospects      for success. Also, provide an assessment of current U.S. policies      regarding industrial standards that may either advantage or disadvantage      U.S. producers and innovators; and as applicable, provide policy recommendations      that could be considered by U.S. agencies seeking to ensure fair market      access for U.S. companies.</span></li>

Based on input from these stakeholders, to what extent have      U.S. companies experienced market exclusion or other consequences as a      result of such restrictions? Identify the extent to which, if any, that      Chinese standards-settings efforts have changed as a result of bilateral      dialogues and/or agreements between the United States and China.</span></li>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal <br>Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.<br>    <br>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71.

App. Sec. 2415).<br>(2) United States means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, outlying areas, and the outer Continental Shelf as defined in 43 U.S.C. 1331.<br>(3) United States person is defined in Section 16(2) of the Export Administration  Act of 1979 and means any United States resident or national (other than an individual resident outside the United States and employed by other than a United States person), any domestic concern (including any permanent domestic establishment of any foreign concern), and any foreign subsidiary or affiliate (including any permanent foreign establishment) of  any domestic concern which is controlled in fact by such domestic concern, as determined under regulations of the President.<br>(b) Certification.<br>By submitting this offer, the Offeror, if a foreign person, company or entity, certifies that it -<br>(1) Does not comply with the Secondary Arab Boycott of Israel; and<br>(2) Is not taking or knowingly agreeing to take any action, with respect to the Secondary Boycott of Israel by Arab countries, which 50 U.S.C.

(This representation does not apply to solicitations for the direct purchase of ocean transportation services).<br>(1) The Offeror shall indicate by checking the appropriate blank in paragraph (c)(2) of this provision whether transportation of supplies by sea is anticipated under the resultant contract. The term "supplies" is defined in the Transportation of Supplies by Sea clause of this solicitation.<br>(2) Representation.<br>The Offeror represents that it-<br>___Does anticipate that supplies will be transported by sea in the performance of any contract or subcontract resulting from this solicitation.<br>___Does not anticipate that supplies will be transported by sea in the performance of any contract or subcontract resulting from this solicitation.<br>(3) Any contract resulting from this solicitation will include the Transportation of Supplies by Sea Clause. If the Offeror represents that it will not use ocean transportation, the resulting contract will also include the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement clause at 252.247-7024, Notification of Transportation of Supplies by Sea.<br><br>(End of provision) <br><br> <br>FAR 52.212-2     EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)<br><br>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: The award decision will be based on the Lowest Priced, Technically Acceptable offer.  Best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price."<br><br> (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br><br>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br><br>(End of provision)<br><br><br>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2<br><br>Paragraph (a) is hereby supplemented with the following:<br><br> (a).  The total evaluated price must be reasonable, and any additional expense must be justified by a corresponding value for technical merit, or an expectation of greater quality of performance.  <br><br>(b).   Contractors may not qualify if any of the following are not met: <br><br>1.   	Proposal does not reasonably address the requirements in the request for proposal (RFP).<br>2.	Proposal includes major deficiencies or omissions which discussions could not be expected to cure without a major revision or a new proposal.<br><br>3.	Proposal is so technically inferior or so out of line in price as compared to other proposals as to preclude it from having a reasonable chance for award.<br><br>4. 	An unrealistically low price, may indicate lack of sound management judgment and lack of understanding of the requirement for the geographic area of service, or unbalanced pricing of line items, as proposed initially or subsequently, may be grounds for eliminating a proposal either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or has made an imprudent offer.<br>5.   The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if necessary.<br><br><br>PART I    TECHINICAL:<br><br>Technical capability to include product literature, catalog price lists if available; warranty, guarantee, technical specs, and  delivery information.<br><br>Technical will be evaluated as either Acceptable or Unacceptable. Best value is expected to result from selection of the technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price.<br><br>Definitions are as follows: <br><br>ACCEPTABLE: To be rated acceptable, the offeror's technical proposal must demonstrate it can meet all requirements. <br><br>UNACCEPTABLE: A technical proposal that fails to demonstrate it can meet one or more requirements will be determined unacceptable. <br><br><br>PART II   PAST PERFORMANCE<br><br>Offeror is required to submit information, on a single page, identifying federal, state and local Government and private contracts performed within the past three years, which are similar in  scope and complexity to the effort described in this solicitation.  If none, offeror should so state and provide information on references.<br><br>Information provided by the Contractor shall state:  The type of service provided with information to verify references:  Names; telephone numbers; Points of Contact; amount of contract; and email addresses.<br><br>Past performance shall be used as an evaluation factor within the LPTA process, unless waived by the PCO in accordance with FAR 15.101- 2(b). It shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 15.305 and DFARS 215.305.  However, the comparative assessment in FAR 15.305(a)(2)(i) does not apply.  Therefore, past performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis using the ratings below.<br><br>Acceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. (See note below.)<br><br>Unacceptable: Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br><br>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability,<br>"unknown" shall be considered "acceptable." A.2.1.2.1 Aspects of Past Performance.<br><br>PART III    PRICE:<br><br>Price will be evaluated separately from Technical and will be evaluated for fairness and reasonability. <br>Offeror shall provide their published price list with their offer. <br><br><br><br>52.212-3     OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (DEB 2012) ALTERNATE I (APR 2011)<br><br><br>Vendors shall include a completed copy of FAR provision 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications with their offer. Offerors shall include a confirmation of receipt of any amendments to this solicitation. Failure to submit a confirmation could result in the offer being determined non- responsive.<br>

In the event of exclusions or over-and-above work, the contractor will be required to submit an equipment condition report to the Contracting Officer detailing the finding and a listing of the additional parts and labor necessary to return the equipment to serviceable condition. Non-re-workable items replaced during modification/overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to include the following changes: (1) Section I Funding Opportunity Description: add additional Focus Area for FY12; (2) Section II, Award Information: last sentence revised for this focus area ONLY; (3) Section IV, APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION, paragraph 3, SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES, is revised to read as follows for this specific focus area ONLY; and (4) Section VII, AGENCY CONTACTS, for this specific focus area ONLY have been changed. No other changes have been made to this BAA.<br /><br />(1) Insert the following under Section I, FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:<br /><br />FY 12 SPECIFIC FOCUS AREA: PROTECTED REPOSITORY FOR THE DEFENSE OF INFRASTRUCTURE AGAINST CYBER THREATS (PREDICT)<br /><br />Background:<br /><br />The Protected Repository for the Defense of Infrastructure Against Cyber Threats (PREDICT) will serve as a large-scale, privacy-protected, dataset repository of real network and system traffic for use by the cyber security research community, both in the U.S. and internationally, to accelerate design, production, and evaluation of next-generation cyber security solutions, including commercial products. The Air Force Research Lab and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are collaborating to foster continued support to provide research relevant Internet data to the cybersecurity community.<br /><br />Objective:<br />&nbsp;<br />The objective is to focus development in two technical areas: Data Hosts (DHs) and Data Providers (DPs). Data Providers provide the data that it owns or has a right to control and disclose to researchers. Similarly, Data Hosts maintain computing infrastructure to store data received from one or more data providers, as well as mechanisms to distribute media if needed. To support the evaluation of next-generation cyber security solutions, including commercial products, PREDICT DHs and DPs will make the types of data described below available to the research community and potentially to international entities. <br /><br />The types of data to be made available include but are not limited to:<br /><br /><strong>Address Space Allocation Data</strong>: Address allocation data is internet data that contains internet protocol (IP) addresses that have properties that can be used to characterize internet topology. The IP addresses in this dataset are typically determined from measurement traffic and not actual sender-receiver communications and are not associated with specific individuals. <br /><br /><strong>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Routing Data</strong>: BGP routing data capture "snapshots" of the topological state of the internet by archiving Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing tables from internet routers in many locations around the world (i.e., Internet Exchange Points). Each routing table expresses the "view" of the internet from that router's point in the overall topology. These datasets contain only topology information; they do not contain any packet header information or information which relates to individuals. <br /><br /><strong>Blackhole Address Space Data</strong>: Blackhole address space data is collected by monitoring routed but unused IP address space that does not host any legitimate networked devices (e.g., hosts or routers). To standardize the terminology "blackhole address space" is used to refer to any unoccupied internet address space, which elsewhere may be referred to as: darkspace, darknets, sinkholes, and background radiation. Domain Name System (DNS)Data: The Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed hierarchical naming system that at its most fundamental level provides a mapping between IP addresses and names. DNS data includes: DNS traffic (e.g., queries and/or responses); DNS server logs; DNS related metadata. These datasets may be collected at or near clients, from DNS recursive resolvers, or DNS servers for an enterprise, top-level, or root domain. <br /><br /><strong>Intrusion Detection System and Firewall Data</strong>: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and firewall data refers to firewall and IDS configuration data, IDS firewall logs and policies and may include protective actions or alerts. <br /><br /><strong>Infrastructure Data</strong>: Infrastructure data is information and metadata about the internet's physical systems and architecture. Infrastructure data includes, but is not limited to: Internet Exchange Point (IXP) lists; directories of international telecommunications cables; telecommunications system configuration data, such as locations of landing points, cable capacity, dates of construction and expansion, and logs of known outages. <br /><br /><strong>Internet Topology Data</strong>: Internet topology data consists of raw and curated topology data gathered from across the internet. Internet topology data may be obtained from traceroute probes and could include IP addresses on machines that a packet traverses along the forward path to a target destination. Additionally, internet topology datasets may be organized into router-level or Autonomous System-level. <br /><br /><strong>Internet Protocol (IP) Packet Headers</strong>: Internet Protocol (IP) packet header datasets are comprised of IP headers containing information such as source and destination IP addresses and other transport protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP, SCTP) header fields. No packet contents are included. <br /><br /><strong>Performance and Quality Measurements</strong>: Performance and quality measurement datasets characterize performance or quality of networks and network services, including response times, throughput, goodput, reliability and resilience, mean-times-between-failure, jitter, diurnal variations, and other measurements, and indicators of Internet quality. Presently the PREDICT project provides VOIP data in this category where the datasets are composed of end-to-end data that characterizes the quality of the paths that VOIP telephone calls take and contains Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) teardown messages collected from both ends of the conversation. <br /><br /><strong>Synthetically Generated Datasets</strong>: Synthetic datasets are datasets created on an artificial testbed using synthetically generated background traffic in conjunction with a foreground attack scenarios. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Unsolicited Bulk Email</strong>: Unsolicited bulk e-mail, or spam, datasets may include spam logs collected at individual organizations, reputation lists data, and e-mails, including both headers and contents, captured at spam traps or otherwise specifically identified as spam. The unsolicited bulk email datasets may also include IP addresses or e-mail addresses of suspected spammers and potentially known spam e-mail message contents. <br /><br /><br /><strong>Traffic Flow Data (e.g., netflow):</strong> Traffic flow datasets are internet traffic flows between two endpoints that have attributes such as source and destination IP address, source and destination port, protocol type, and packet and byte counts. The format of the traffic flow datasets are netflow, IPFIX, and argus.<br /><br />Offerors are invited to submit proposals to participate in the PREDICT project by addressing one or both technical areas. In all cases, the offeror shall propose to provide datasets for publication and hosting that are compliant with all laws and regulations that are pertinent to the dataset content, to include AF and DHS privacy policies, and full compliance with the PREDICT legal framework (which includes international dissemination), also described above. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to select one or more tasks per white paper/ proposal and to select individual PREDICT dataset types for any task proposed. An overarching requirement of all Data Providers (DPs) is an explicit assertion that they own or have a right to control and disclose to researchers the data they propose to provide, and that they will provide a legal and ethical risk assessment of each dataset they would provide (within thirty (30) days of selection). Lastly, to support measuring the utility of the data PREDICT provides, offerors will need to identify metrics to describe the utility, growth and management of the data they host or provide.<br /><br /><br />In addition, central to PREDICT management and operations is the PREDICT Coordinating Center (PCC). The PCC facilitates the release of datasets by data hosts to approved researchers, subject to the terms and conditions set forth by DHS, the PCC, data providers, and data hosts. In support of these activities, the PCC develops, hosts and maintains a web portal (see http://www.predict.org) that advertises the catalog of datasets available from the PREDICT program and automates the generation of appropriate agreements for and between PREDICT entities. Offerors for either the DP and/or DH technical area are required to coordinate with the PCC to support the PREDICT legal framework. White papers/proposals for the PCC are not being solicited under this BAA.<br /><br /><br />Finally, the PREDICT project relies on program-wide collaboration and outreach efforts to the greater information technology research community. It is anticipated that there will be three (3) principal investigator (PI) meetings a year at performer locations in the United States, and offerors are encouraged to describe outreach activities that would be consistent with their proposals.<br /><br />(2) Section II, AWARD INFORMATION, the last sentence is revised for this specific focus area ONLY to read as follows:<br /><br />"Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of cooperative agreements only."<br /><br />(3) Section IV, APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION INFORMATION, paragraph 3, SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES, is revised to read as follows for this specific focus area ONLY:<br /><br />"WHITE PAPER DUE DATE AND TIME: White papers will be accepted on or before 2 PM Eastern Standard Time, 6 April 2012 for this focus area ONLY. Late white paper submissions will not be accepted after this due date. Only white papers are due at this time. Full proposals will be requested by the Government from those Offerors selected in the white paper evaluation process.<br /><br />(4) Section VII, AGENCY CONTACTS, for this specific focus area ONLY, the cognizant Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) is specified below:<br /><br /><br />TPOC Name: Robert Kaminski<br />Telephone: (315) 330-4459<br />Email: Robert.Kaminski@rl.af.mil

<DESC>16a. Description:
<p>The Defense Weather Systems Directorate (DWSD) Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM) program office, on behalf of the United States Air Force, is seeking information from companies who could provide a production capability for Sixteen (16) space-based "TriG" Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Radio Occultation (RO) flight articles, providing total electron content (ionosphere), ionospheric scintillation , vertical refractivity, water vapor and temperature profiles in the troposphere. The companies should also provide options for the associated TriG-to-space vehicle integration and test support, and for commercially priced controlled storage facilities needed for the program. A flight article is defined as a fully functional sensor incorporating all the development efforts from Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The addition of the language "flight article" should not imply that we are requesting anything other than the standard GNSS RO sensor.</p>
<p>Data collected from the GNSS RO sensor can be used to measure ionospheric electron density characteristics and tropospheric weather information. A prototype of the TriG GNSS RO is currently in development by JPL and will be used to support the transition from an engineering model to flight quality sensors.</p>
<p>16b. Purpose:<br />This is a Sources Sought for market research purposes to identify potential organizations that can deliver the required products. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the Government is interested in estimated cost and schedule information based on independent organizations capability to deliver the TriG GNSS RO capability in a fully functional set of twelve sensors.</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY. This sources sought is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotation) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This sources sought does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. We are not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this sources sought. All costs associated with responding to this sources sought will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>All information received in response to this sources sought that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly.

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification of previous notice to the draft RFP is to answer OCI questions previously submitted.  Please note, some of these questions were submitted prior to the revised OCI clause dated February 09, 2012.<br><br>1)	Question:  Will the Government revise the language in the anticipated Organization Conflict of Interest clause in order to provide a boarder competitive environment for this solicitation?<br><br>Answer: See the amended OCI clause posted 09 Feb 2012.<br><br>2)	Question: Due to the broad range and unpredictable nature of services that may be required under this contract that could create OCIs for any contractor in the future, will the government revise the language in the anticipated Organization Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause to allow contractors to implement mitigation strategies at the task order and technical instruction level?<br><br>Answer: See the amended OCI clause posted 09 Feb 2012.<br><br>3)	Is it the Government's intent to OCI out any company that is on an AMCOM Express team, whether or not the company currently has work on AMCOM Express?  <br><br>Answer: See the amended OCI clause posted 09 Feb 2012.<br><br>4)	What will be the Government process for determining/evaluating OCI potentials for a subcontractor on LSFMA that is a subcontractor on an Express team that is doing CAAS type work for one Army Program office, but the LSFMA work may be for a different Army Program office?<br><br>Answer: See the amended OCI clause posted 09 Feb 2012.<br><br>5)	May a contractor participate on a winning LSFMA proposal though it may have work in a project office that is not a direct customer?  An example could be that a subcontractor to an LSFMA Prime supports the PM-Cargo project office, but the LSFMA Task Order is for PM Apache.  Taking this further, if an LSFMA subcontractor supports PM-Common Missile Defense System, do they have an OCI as an LSFMA subcontractor?  <br><br>Answer: See the amended OCI clause posted 09 Feb 2012.<br><br>6)	Has the Government considered that implementation of the OCI clause, as currently drafted, could have the impact of limiting the participation of numerous, capable Huntsville area businesses on the LSFMA contract, and thus limiting competition?  (Implementation of the OCI clause could impact the current team compositions (Subcontractors) of some potential Prime bidders, with the exception of the incumbent, who, to the best of our knowledge, does no AMCOM Express work.)<br><br>Answer:  Yes.<br><br>7)	Does the Government plan to make its decision on the final wording and/or implementation of the OCI clause, and advise Industry, prior to issuance of the formal LSFMA RFP? To delay a decision until the RFP is actually issued could have the impact of forcing some Prime bidders to quickly re-structure their subcontractor teams in a very limited amount of time, and potentially place them at a competitive disadvantage to the incumbent.<br><br>Answer: See the amended OCI clause posted 09 Feb 2012.<br><br>8)	We respectively believe many bidders may not agree the AMCOM Express Technical, Programmatic or Logistics domains are generally involved in supporting the LSFMA Requiring elements in providing services that include elements in FAR Part 9.505.  The AMCOM Express vehicle and many other contract vehicles are broad in nature and may not result in an OCI for the work contemplated in the LSFMA contract.  The government in most cases has included OCI language that addresses potential OCI issues on a task order-by-task order basis or allows offeror's an opportunity to present OCI mitigation strategies, rather than excluding a large pool of bidders from participating in major Solicitations. We respectfully request the removal of the planned OCI language which will exclude AMCOM Express contractors and subcontractors, numbering up to 1400 companies, as we deem this to be a violation (contrary) to The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984, as implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6, and Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) Part 206, which sets the standard of competition in Federal contracts.<br><br>Answer: See the amended OCI clause posted 09 Feb 2012.<br><br>9)	As the benefits of competition: drives cost savings, improves quality of products/services, enhances solutions and the industrial base, promotes fairness and openness leading to public trust and overall increases the likelihood of efficiencies and innovations, we believe excluding AMCOM Express contractors and subcontractors who should have the ability to address potential OCI issues as they may arise under this program, favors the incumbent and will not be deemed to be fair and reasonable, nor supportive of the requirements of FAR Part 6-Competion Requirements. We request excluding AMCOM Express contractors and subcontractors from the LSFMA Solicitation be deleted from the RFP, especially since such OCI issues are perceived and may not arise under the work contemplated by the RFP.<br><br>Answer:  See the amended OCI clause posted 09 Feb 2012.<br><br>10)	COMPANY A currently provides support to PM AME, specifically APM ABC that involves CAAS.  Is APM ABC a requiring agency for LSF?  If so, will COMPANY A be excluded from competition?  In the past, we have dealt with potential OCIs by putting an adequate mitigation plan in place.  Please advise.<br><br>Answer: APM ABC is not currently utilizing the LSF support contract.  However, program offices are constantly added for the LSF program. The OCI clause posted 09 Feb 2012 applies both pre and post award.  <br><br>11)	Is the intent of the W58RGZ-11-R-0231 Draft OCI Amendment language (as published) to result in any or a combination of the following?<br><br>i)	Prohibit the participation of active AMCOM EXPRESS Prime Contractors, Team Members or Subcontractors on the LSFMA Solicitation?<br><br>Answer: See the amended OCI Clause posted 09 Feb 2012<br><br>ii)	Prohibit the performance of active AMCOM EXPRESS Prime Contractors, Team Members or Subcontractors currently providing CAAS (of any type) directly to PEOAVN PMOs and PEOM&S PMOs on the LSFMA Solicitation?<br><br>Answer: See the amended OCI Clause posted 09 Feb 2012<br><br>iii)	Prohibit the performance of active AMCOM EXPRESS Prime Contractors, Team Members or Subcontractors currently providing CAAS (technical expertise) to Government Engineering Organizations (e.g., AMRDEC) that serve PEOAVN PMOs and PEOM&S PMOs on the LSFMA Solicitation?<br><br>Answer: See the amended OCI Clause posted 09 Feb 2012<br><br>iv)	Prohibit the performance of active AMCOM EXPRESS Prime Contractors, Team Members or Subcontractors that have an identified OCI from participating at the Task Order (TO) Level; post-contract award? Where OCI is identified as past, present or planned interest (financial, contractual, organizational, or otherwise as contractor, subcontractor, or consultant) relating to the work to be performed under the LSFMA TO and bearing on whether the LSFMA TO Team has a possible OCI with respect to being able to render impartial, technically sound, and objective assistance or advice, result in a biased work product or may result in being given an unfair competitive advantage.<br><br>Answer: See the amended OCI Clause posted 09 Feb 2012<br><br>12)	I am assuming that if you are a contract provider of equipment for PEO AVN, then the OCI clause does not apply.  For example, COMPANY A has one of its divisions supporting PEO AVN for a component of the Kiowa Warrior and has access to information needed to support that platform  - Assume NO OCI??<br><br>Answer:  If you have access to another company's proprietary data, you have a potential OCI.  See the amended OCI clause posted 09 Feb 2012.<br><br>13)	Does the OCI clause apply to the Primes only or to the Primes and all teammates and subs?<br><br>Answer: See the amended OCI Clause posted 09 Feb 2012<br><br>14)	How do you define the LSF Requiring elements that drive the OCI?<br><br>Answer:  Any PEO Aviation program or supporting engineering offices.<br><br>15)	How do you define "other contract vehicles"?<br><br>Answer: See the amended OCI clause posted 09 Feb 2012<br><br>16)	Will each Prime and its subs be required to have an OCI mitigation Plan?<br><br>Answer: See the amended OCI clause posted 09 Feb 2012<br><br>17)	The clarification states that contractors providing CAAS under the AMCOM Express contract vehicle...are considered to have Organizational Conflicts of Interest.  Is this meant to convey that having any contract under the AMCOM Express contract vehicle is considered to be an OCI?  Or are there certain cases in which one can have a contract through AMCOM EXPRESS and it not be considered an OCI?  As an example, providing technical support for training devices in a capacity that does not include the development of specifications or requirements that could later be competed under the LSFMA contract vehicle. <br><br>Answer: See the amended OCI clause posted 09 Feb 2012<br><br>18)	The OCI instructions read, "If you are a prime contractor on the AMCOM EXPRESS contract, you are considered to have an OCI with the LSFMA program that will require a mitigation plan that, at a minimum, divests you from working on the AMCOM EXPRESS contract for any current or future work supporting a particular program office once the program office commences effort generating an LSFMA requirement. If you are a subcontractor to a prime on the AMCOM EXPRESS contract, you are considered to have an OCI that has the potential for issues during the life of the LSFMA contract and a robust OCI mitigation plan is required."  <br><br>Are subcontractors also divested from working on the AM COM Express contract for any current or future work supporting a particular program office once the program office commences effort generating an LSFMA requirement?<br><br>Answer: If unable to mitigate the OCI, and continuing to work in the program office, yes it is a distinct possibility.<br><br>19)	 How are we, a Contractor, supposed to know when a PM has commenced effort to generate an LSFMA requirement?<br><br>Answer: Notification will be made when multiple-award contractors and team members receive information or are approached about a forthcoming requirement.  It will be incumbent upon each successful offeror to notify the government of any OCI. <br><br>20)	What is the operative action that triggers the "commencement of effort to generate a LSFMA requirement"?<br><br>Answer: When the LSFMA accepts the work, receives a draft requirement, or any engineering oversight.<br><br>21)	Will the contractors overarching mitigation plan be evaluated as part of the proposal evaluation process and, if so, what are the evaluation factors associated with the overarching mitigation plan?<br><br>Answer:  The OCI is not part of the source selection plan, but a mitigation plan is required.<br><br>22)	The second paragraph of Section H-25, Introduction includes the following statement:<br><br>"An overarching mitigation plan is required to be submitted with the contractors competitive proposal for Government review and ultimately into the contract."<br><br> 	QUESTION: Will the contractors overarching mitigation plan be evaluated as part of the proposal evaluation process and, if so, what are the evaluation factors associated with the overarching mitigation plan?<br><br>Answer: No.  <br><br> 	QUESTION:  Will the overarching mitigation plan be submitted separately for approval before the final RFP is released so that contractors can ensure they are selectable before incurring the significant costs associated with developing a proposal?<br><br>Answer: No.  The clause is comprehensive.<br><br> 	QUESTION:  Given the complexity of this OCI issue, will the government consider conducting1-on-1 sessions with potential primes to discuss specific circumstances and concerns and then provide potential primes with an opinion as to the selectability of the potential prime? <br><br>Answer: No.  The clause is comprehensive.<br><br>23)	The second paragraph of Section H-25, Introduction includes the following statement:<br><br>""Contractor", as used in this clause, means any person, firm or corporation which has a majority or controlling interest in the contractor or in any parent corporation thereof, any person, firm, or corporation in or as to which the contractor (or any parent or subsidiary corporation thereof) has a majority or controlling interest."<br><br> 	BACKGROUND: Company A is an LLC co-owned by Company B and Company C.  Company B & C each own 50% of Company A and have equal representation on the Board of Managers such that neither company has majority or controlling interest.  Company A is an AMCOM EXPRESS prime and was also a prime on the predecessor contract, AMCOM Omnibus 2000 (O2K).  Company A is managed by a President and administrative support staff that are all employees of the LLC (not Company B or C employees) and that do not provide direct support to any AMCOM EXPRESS task order.  All work received through the EXPRESS prime contract is awarded to B & C, as subcontractors. <br><br> 	QUESTION: Does the government concur that Company B & C are subcontractors on AMCOM EXPRESS and not a prime contractors per the terms of the language in the LSFMA OCI Clause cited above?<br><br>Answer:  No.  <br><br>24) Section H-25, paragraph d., Task Order Level OCI indicates that LSFMA contractors may have "access to source selection or other acquisition information," may asked to draft "statements of work, specifications, cost estimates, or evaluation criteria of future procurement," or may be required to "assess and evaluate systems, subsystems, components, software, equipment, services, and other products developed/provided by Government contractors."   These functions fall into the category of CAAS and are not consistent with the LSFMA PWS. <br><br> 	QUESTION: Will the government remove these requirements from the OCI clause as the LSFMA PWS does not address performance of CAAS services?<br><br>Answer:  No.<br><br>25)	Section H-25, paragraph (e) (4) Protection of Information, the Government states the contractor shall  "indemnify the Government as to any cost/loss resulting from the unauthorized use or disclosure of any third-party proprietary information by its employees, the employees of subcontractors, or by its agents."<br><br> 	QUESTION:  In the text above are the "employees" and "agents" those of the contractor?<br><br>Answer: Yes.<br><br>

Contractor will be furnishing labor, equipment, and materials to construct fence and assocated gates, panels and drainage crossings with specified Government furnished property.  Project areas are located in Elko County, Nevada.
The government may award MULTIPLE Firm Fixed Price contracts resulting from this solicitation. Offerors may submit costs for ALL, SOME, OR NONE of the projects.

<DESC>Request for Information: Consumer Credit Information Panel<br /><br />Background: Consumer Credit Information Panel for Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Research<br /><br />The CFPB seeks to acquire and maintain a nationally representative panel of credit information on consumers for use in a wide range of policy research projects. <br /><br />The panel would be a random sample of consumer credit files obtained from a national database of credit files. The outside contractor would provide an initial panel of consumers with information on an annual or quarterly basis for each of the last 10 years. Going forward, the contractor would provide updated consumer credit files for the consumers in the database on an annual or quarterly basis.<br /><br />The CFPB seeks to obtain information that will enable it to identify the important design considerations in developing such a panel. The CFPB requests comments on the following issues.<br /><br />Study population:<br /><br />&bull; The CFPB may consider the household as the appropriate sampling unit for the panel. How would your organization construct a panel based on households? <br /><br />&bull; Can your organization identify joint borrowers, co-signers, and/or authorized users? How? Should the Bureau append to the core sample of consumers or households joint borrowers, co-signers, and/or authorize users? What are the trade-offs the Bureau should consider in making this determination?<br /><br />&bull; The panel will have ongoing annual or quarterly refreshes. What are the benefits of moving from an annual to a quarterly update schedule? Additionally, does your organization have the ability to provide data for interim periods? For example, if you provide quarterly updates, can you provide monthly data on credit balances? For example, for an end-of-calendar Q1 data pull, would you be able to tell us the credit balances for consumers in January and February?<br /><br />&bull; One issue of concern is how the CFPB should treat files that are split. A file might be split if new tradelines reveal that a consumer identified as a single individual is actually two people. Similarly, a file might be split because some tradelines are identified as fraudulent. How would your organization handle credit files that are split between sample pulls? How would you suggest treating these files to maintain the representativeness of the panel? Can your technology identify these split files?<br /><br />&bull; A similar concern is how the CFPB should treat files that get combined. For example, two files might be combined if new tradelines reveal that two files actually belong to a single consumer. How would your organization handle credit files that are combined between sample pulls? How would you suggest treating these files to maintain the representativeness of the panel? Can your technology follow two files that are combined into a single file?<br /><br />&bull; The CFPB would like to do an initial data pull that goes back 10 years. For each of the years in this initial pull, the sample needs to be representative of the population of credit files at that time. Given this objective, what methodology is recommended to establish the initial sample? If an initial pull is for 10 years, should the base population be selected at a current date, should it be selected at the beginning of the 10 year data pull, or should the CFPB consider an alternate method?<br /><br />&bull; An important consideration in designing the panel is to maintain its representativeness over time. Describe the methods your organization could provide to assure the ongoing representativeness of the panel. Would your organization compare updated samples with a representative sample of the current credit population?<br /><br />&bull; How would your organization plan to identify new entrants to update the panel over time? In your answer, could you specifically address the challenge of differentiating between truly new entrants and files that look like new entrants, but are really not (e.g., files that are split over time).<br /><br />&bull; If the CFPB pulls a sample today, and then tries the pull the updated records of the same sample a year from now, should the CFPB assume that some files won't be found? Could you list the specific reasons why your organization might not be able to find all the records?<br /><br />&bull; The CFPB seeks input on the recommended size of the panel. The CFPB is estimating a panel of roughly 1 million consumers. The Bureau intends to study the behavior of individuals and financial products over time on a national and regional basis. Do the consumer panels deployed by other Federal agencies and private sector entities offer a meaningful comparative metric?<br /><br />&bull; Please provide any additional recommendations for constructing an initial credit panel.<br /><br />Data Characteristics:<br /><br />&bull; Central to the creation of the panel is the ability to track consumers over time. Please describe how your organization follows consumers over time. If individuals are tracked by means of a unique identifier, under what condition can this identifier change? If two credit records are combined, which identifier (if either) is maintained? Similarly, if a credit record splits into multiple records, how are the identifiers for the new records assigned?<br /><br />&bull; The consumer panel would include available information in the consumer's credit file. To maintain consumer privacy, what data fields would have to be anonymized? Please identify the specific data fields that could be made available for analysis.<br /><br />&bull; Are there additional variables associated with the consumer credit file that are not part of a consumer report, but would be available for research (e.g. identity theft flag)? Please identify other raw data fields that the CFPB could consider obtaining as part of the panel.<br /><br />Panel Features: <br /><br />&bull; The CFPB would like to use the consumer credit panel to analyze and survey subpopulations of individual consumers on their use of specific types of products (e.g. private label cards; general purpose branded cards) and product subclasses (e.g., first time home equity loans). How would you recommend developing the panel to permit such surveys? How would you implement such a survey consistent with Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) obligations?<br /><br />&bull; The CFPB is interested in tracking the tradelines of particular consumers over time.<br /><br />o What techniques/technologies are available to enable such tracking?<br />o Can such technologies track accounts after they have been sold (e.g. to a debt buyer) or transferred?

<DESC>The purpose of this admendment is to clarify estimated quantity of units, the performance period of contract and solicitation posting date.
As a result, the estimated quantity of Allison Transmission battery packs required will be approximately 11 units. The expected performance period will be one base year with one option year. Solicitation posting date will be on/about March 23, 2012.
This will be a procurement action based on a Brand Name Justification stated below.                                                  
The National Park Service operates a visitor shuttle bus system in Yosemite National Park. This system consists of twenty-two hybrid electric diesel 39 passenger buses manufactured by Gillig Corporation, Hayward, California.  Eighteen buses were purchased by NPS for Yosemite in 2005; four additional hybrid electric diesel buses were acquired in 2011.
The power system of these buses consists of an electric battery pack and diesel engine.  The battery pack has a useful life of approximately six years, at which time electric storage system (ESS) refresh battery kits/conversion kits are needed to keep the buses operating.  The eighteen buses acquired in 2005 are in need of refresh/conversion kits.   
Electric storage system (ESS) Refresh Kit and ESS1 to ESS2 Conversion Kit are an assimilation of electric propulsion components and parts provided by Allison Electric Drive, the original engine manufacturer (OEM) of the Gillig hybrid electric diesel 39 passenger buses which comprise the park's visitor transportation (shuttle bus) system.
The ESS Refresh Kit/ESS1 to ESS2 Conversion Kit is a package of engine parts and components specified by the OEM for the Gillig hybrid electric diesel buses. The Electric storage system (ESS) Refresh Kit and ESS1 to ESS2 Conversion are the only package of components and parts specified by the OEM. The refresher kit package provided by Allison Electric Drive meets all the specifications of the Gillig power system. No other refresher kit/conversion kit package is provided or specified for the Gillig power system.
The ESS Refresh Kit is essential to the continued operation of the electric propulsion system of the Gillig hybrid electric diesel buses.  Each refresher kit lasts approximately six years.  The original fleet of 18 Gillig hybrid diesel buses was delivered in May 2005.
All other information posted on original announcement remain unchanged.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because it was not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence. As such, a labor-hours type action was awarded for non-commercial services (FAR 16.602).<br><br>C-ARCHITECT AND ENGINEERING SERVICES<br>"Small Business Set-Aside Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services within the Northwestern Division (MEGA Phase A)"<br><br>1. Contract Information: The Northwestern Division (NWD) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement to acquire Architect-Engineer (A-E) Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste (HTRW)/Environmental Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for execution of its environmental mission.  This contract acquisition is part of NWD's Phase A of the Multiple Environmental Government Acquisition (MEGA). These regional A-E contract acquisitions will be conducted in accordance with Public Law 92-582, the Brooks Act, and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 236.6. The majority of the work will be located within the NWD (including Kansas City, Omaha, and Seattle Districts). In support of this effort, the Government intends to award contracts to three (3) Small Business (SB) firms sharing $20 million in total contract capacity. However, if the Contracting Officer determines during the selection process that fewer or more than three (3) contracts should be awarded, based upon the selection criteria, the Contracting Officer has the discretion of adjusting that number, or awarding none at all. <br><br>The period of performance for each contract will include a base period of three (3) years and one option period of two (2) years. It is anticipated that the contracts will be awarded not earlier than December 2011. Task orders will be issued as the need arises during the contract period. Task order assignments will be determined with consideration of each firm's experience, qualifications, past performance, capability, and capacity. These task orders may be either firm fixed-price or cost reimbursable type orders. The period of performance on individual task orders shall not exceed five (5) years. Firms receiving award will share an ordering amount of $20 million over the life of the contracts. <br><br>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 -- Engineering Services. For the purposes of this procurement a concern is considered a small business if its average annual gross receipts are $4.5 million or less. More than one contract will be awarded for the same scope of work. Under the Brooks Act, price competition is not allowed for A-E contracts. When a requirement is identified, the government will first determine if it is a new requirement or a follow-on effort to an existing HTRW/environmental project. Due to the nature of the requirements, projects are completed in phases such as preliminary assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility study, and then design. If a follow-on requirement, determination of the selected A-E will be conducted considering a firm's experience, qualifications, capability, and capacity to perform the work. For new requirements, the project scope will be reviewed to determine whether the requirement can be accomplished using a firm fixed-price task order or whether uncertainties will require the use of a cost reimbursable task order. Experience, qualifications, past performance, capability, and capacity will be considered to determine which firm is best qualified to accomplish the work. <br><br>The period of performance for the IDC will begin on the date of contract award and will be in effect for the three (3) year base period; in addition there is a provision for one two (2) year option period; if the option period is exercised, the length of the contract will be five (5) years. The period of performance for task orders awarded under the IDCs will be determined based upon the work requirement (not to exceed five (5) years) and will be included in the task order solicitation and negotiated award documents. The Service Contract Act of 1965, as Amended, is applicable to this solicitation and resulting contracts and will be incorporated into same. Service wage rates will be determined relative to the employee's office location rather than the location of work.  <br><br>To be eligible for contract award, a firm must have a DUNS number from Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) and be registered in the Department of Defense (DoD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-866-606-8220. D&B can be reached by calling 1-866-705-5711. Firms are also required to use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the representations and certifications required by the FAR and previously found in solicitations. Detailed information can be found in the Help section of the ORCA website at http://orca.bpn.gov. The help section includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), the ORCA Handbook, and whom to call for assistance. Additionally, in accordance with FAR Part 22.1303, all firms must complete their VETS-100 report. Information can be found at the Department of Labor website http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/fcp/main.htm, or call the service center at 1-866-237-0275; you will be asked to provide your company name, employer identification number (EIN), and DUNS number.<br><br>2. Project Information: Firms must be capable of performing work on a wide variety of HTRW/environmental sites in a manner that complies with federal, state, and local regulations and laws, and within time frames required. A majority of the work to be performed is expected to be for HTRW/environmental projects in NWD. Specific needs will be determined based upon project requirements as described in each task order. Project assignments will typically require performance on-site and in an office setting. Assignments will include, but not be limited to: site investigations, subsurface exploration, chemical sampling, testing and analyses, hazard evaluations, feasibility and other engineering studies and reports, archaeological investigations and mitigation, wetlands determination and mitigation studies, groundwater and other modeling, contaminant fate and transport analysis, HTRW remedial designs, preparation of plans and specifications, cost estimating, value engineering screenings and studies, field inspections, verification of existing conditions, pilot studies, surveying and mapping, community relations, construction-phase services (engineering design during construction, checking shop drawings), evaluations of green technologies and energy conservation measures, and other related services. Selected firms will work on a variety of hazardous waste and other environmental projects, including, but not limited to: contaminated soil and groundwater, contaminated sediments, radioactive and mixed wastes, underground storage tanks and fueling systems and habitat restoration and mitigation. For on-site investigations, firms must provide personnel with current health and safety training, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).<br>

<DESC>C-ARCHITECT AND ENGINEERING SERVICES<br>"Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Set-Aside Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services within the Northwestern Division (MEGA Phase A)"<br><br>1. Contract Information: The Northwestern Division (NWD) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement to acquire Architect-Engineer (A-E) Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste (HTRW)/Environmental Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for execution of its environmental mission.  This contract acquisition is part of NWD's Phase A of the Multiple Environmental Government Acquisition (MEGA). These regional A-E contract acquisitions will be conducted in accordance with Public Law 92-582, the Brooks Act, and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 236.6. The majority of the work will be located within the NWD (including Kansas City, Omaha, and Seattle Districts). In support of this effort, the Government intends to award contracts to two (2) Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms sharing $10 million in total contract capacity. However, if the Contracting Officer determines during the selection process that fewer or more than two (2) contracts should be awarded, based upon the selection criteria, the Contracting Officer has the discretion of adjusting that number, or awarding none at all. <br><br>The period of performance for each contract will include a base period of three (3) years and one option period of two (2) years. It is anticipated that the contracts will be awarded not earlier than December 2011. Task orders will be issued as the need arises during the contract period. Task order assignments will be determined with consideration of each firm's experience, qualifications, past performance, capability, and capacity. These task orders will be firm fixed-price. The period of performance on individual task orders shall not exceed five (5) years. Firms receiving award will share an ordering amount of $10 million over the life of the contracts. <br><br>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 -- Engineering Services. For the purposes of this procurement a concern is considered a small business if its average annual gross receipts are $4.5 million or less. More than one contract will be awarded for the same scope of work. Under the Brooks Act, price competition is not allowed for A-E contracts. When a requirement is identified, the government will first determine if it is a new requirement or a follow-on effort to an existing HTRW/environmental project. Due to the nature of the requirements, projects are completed in phases such as preliminary assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility study, and then design. Experience, qualifications, past performance, capability, and capacity will be considered to determine which firm is best qualified to accomplish the work for either a new or follow-on requirement. <br><br>The period of performance for the IDC will begin on the date of contract award and will be in effect for the three (3) year base period; in addition there is a provision for one two (2) year option period; if the option period is exercised, the length of the contract will be five (5) years. The period of performance for task orders awarded under the IDCs will be determined based upon the work requirement (not to exceed five (5) years) and will be included in the task order solicitation and negotiated award documents. The Service Contract Act of 1965, as Amended, is applicable to this solicitation and resulting contracts and will be incorporated into same. Service wage rates will be determined relative to the employee's office location rather than the location of work.  <br><br>To be eligible for contract award, a firm must have a DUNS number from Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) and be registered in the Department of Defense (DoD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-866-606-8220. D&B can be reached by calling 1-866-705-5711. Firms are also required to use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the representations and certifications required by the FAR and previously found in solicitations. Detailed information can be found in the Help section of the ORCA website at http://orca.bpn.gov. The help section includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), the ORCA Handbook, and whom to call for assistance. Additionally, in accordance with FAR Part 22.1303, all firms must complete their VETS-100 report. Information can be found at the Department of Labor website http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/fcp/main.htm, or call the service center at 1-866-237-0275; you will be asked to provide your company name, employer identification number (EIN), and DUNS number.<br><br>2. Project Information: Firms must be capable of performing work on a wide variety of HTRW/environmental sites in a manner that complies with federal, state, and local regulations and laws, and within time frames required. A majority of the work to be performed is expected to be for HTRW/environmental projects in NWD. Specific needs will be determined based upon project requirements as described in each task order. Project assignments will typically require performance on-site and in an office setting. Assignments will include, but not be limited to: site investigations, subsurface exploration, chemical sampling, testing and analyses, hazard evaluations, feasibility and other engineering studies and reports, archaeological investigations and mitigation, wetlands determination and mitigation studies, groundwater and other modeling, contaminant fate and transport analysis, HTRW remedial designs, preparation of plans and specifications, cost estimating, value engineering screenings and studies, field inspections, verification of existing conditions, pilot studies, surveying and mapping, community relations, construction-phase services (engineering design during construction, checking shop drawings), evaluations of green technologies and energy conservation measures, and other related services. Selected firms will work on a variety of hazardous waste and other environmental projects, including, but not limited to: contaminated soil and groundwater, contaminated sediments, radioactive and mixed wastes, underground storage tanks and fueling systems and habitat restoration and mitigation. For on-site investigations, firms must provide personnel with current health and safety training, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).<br>

<DESC>C-ARCHITECT AND ENGINEERING SERVICES<br>"HUBZone Small Business Set-Aside Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for Architect-Engineer (A-E) Services within the Northwestern Division (MEGA Phase A)"<br><br>1. Contract Information: The Northwestern Division (NWD) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a requirement to acquire Architect-Engineer (A-E) Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste (HTRW)/Environmental Indefinite Delivery Contracts (IDC) for execution of its environmental mission.  This contract acquisition is part of NWD's Phase A of the Multiple Environmental Government Acquisition (MEGA). These regional A-E contract acquisitions will be conducted in accordance with Public Law 92-582, the Brooks Act, and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 236.6. The majority of the work will be located within the NWD (including Kansas City, Omaha, and Seattle Districts). In support of this effort, the Government intends to award contracts to two (2) HUBZone Small Business firms sharing $10 million in total contract capacity. However, if the Contracting Officer determines during the selection process that fewer or more than two (2) contracts should be awarded, based upon the selection criteria, the Contracting Officer has the discretion of adjusting that number, or awarding none at all. <br><br>The period of performance for each contract will include a base period of three (3) years and one option period of two (2) years. It is anticipated that the contracts will be awarded not earlier than December 2011. Task orders will be issued as the need arises during the contract period. Task order assignments will be determined with consideration of each firm's experience, qualifications, past performance, capability, and capacity. These task orders will be firm fixed-price. The period of performance on individual task orders shall not exceed five (5) years. Firms receiving award will share an ordering amount of $10 million over the life of the contracts. <br><br>The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 -- Engineering Services. For the purposes of this procurement a concern is considered a small business if its average annual gross receipts are $4.5 million or less. More than one contract will be awarded for the same scope of work. Under the Brooks Act, price competition is not allowed for A-E contracts. When a requirement is identified, the government will first determine if it is a new requirement or a follow-on effort to an existing HTRW/environmental project. Due to the nature of the requirements, projects are completed in phases such as preliminary assessment, remedial investigation, feasibility study, and then design. Experience, qualifications, past performance, capability, and capacity will be considered to determine which firm is best qualified to accomplish the work for either a new or follow-on requirement. <br><br>The period of performance for the IDC will begin on the date of contract award and will be in effect for the three (3) year base period; in addition there is a provision for one two (2) year option period; if the option period is exercised, the length of the contract will be five (5) years. The period of performance for task orders awarded under the IDCs will be determined based upon the work requirement (not to exceed five (5) years) and will be included in the task order solicitation and negotiated award documents. The Service Contract Act of 1965, as Amended, is applicable to this solicitation and resulting contracts and will be incorporated into same. Service wage rates will be determined relative to the employee's office location rather than the location of work.  <br><br>To be eligible for contract award, a firm must have a DUNS number from Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) and be registered in the Department of Defense (DoD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Register via the CCR Internet site at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-866-606-8220. D&B can be reached by calling 1-866-705-5711. Firms are also required to use the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage, and viewing of many of the representations and certifications required by the FAR and previously found in solicitations. Detailed information can be found in the Help section of the ORCA website at http://orca.bpn.gov. The help section includes ORCA background information, frequently asked questions (FAQ), the ORCA Handbook, and whom to call for assistance. Additionally, in accordance with FAR Part 22.1303, all firms must complete their VETS-100 report. Information can be found at the Department of Labor website http://www.dol.gov/vets/programs/fcp/main.htm, or call the service center at 1-866-237-0275; you will be asked to provide your company name, employer identification number (EIN), and DUNS number.<br><br>2. Project Information: Firms must be capable of performing work on a wide variety of HTRW/environmental sites in a manner that complies with federal, state, and local regulations and laws, and within time frames required. A majority of the work to be performed is expected to be for HTRW/environmental projects in NWD. Specific needs will be determined based upon project requirements as described in each task order. Project assignments will typically require performance on-site and in an office setting. Assignments will include, but not be limited to: site investigations, subsurface exploration, chemical sampling, testing and analyses, hazard evaluations, feasibility and other engineering studies and reports, archaeological investigations and mitigation, wetlands determination and mitigation studies, groundwater and other modeling, contaminant fate and transport analysis, HTRW remedial designs, preparation of plans and specifications, cost estimating, value engineering screenings and studies, field inspections, verification of existing conditions, pilot studies, surveying and mapping, community relations, construction-phase services (engineering design during construction, checking shop drawings), evaluations of green technologies and energy conservation measures, and other related services. Selected firms will work on a variety of hazardous waste and other environmental projects, including, but not limited to: contaminated soil and groundwater, contaminated sediments, radioactive and mixed wastes, underground storage tanks and fueling systems and habitat restoration and mitigation. For on-site investigations, firms must provide personnel with current health and safety training, as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).<br>

<DESC>1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE REQUIRING AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:
<p>a. Requesting Activity:</p>
<p>Information &amp; Technology Division - Columbus (I&amp;T-CO)<br />ATTN: DFAS-ZTA<br />8899 E. 56th Street<br />Indianapolis, IN 46249-4300<br />(317) 212-3578<br />b. Contracting Activity</p>
<p>DFAS Columbus<br />Contract Services Directorate<br />3990 East Broad Street<br />Columbus, OH 43213-1152</p>
<p><br />2. NATURE OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION:</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to obtain the necessary approvals for a limited source acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 8.405-6. "Limited source" in this case pertains to the award of a logical follow-on task order for the continuation of DFAS Financial Integrated Support Systems, Version III (DFISS III) systems support for I&amp;T-CO. The provision for a logical follow-on can be found at FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C) and FAR 16.505(b)(2)(i)(C). This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, Title III of the Federal Property Administration Act of 1949. The estimated value of this task order is $1,849,495.73. It will be set up as a time and material order. The period of performance is from March 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012.</p>
<p><br />3. DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICE:</p>
<p>The DFISS III Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) were awarded in April 2007 to fulfill a continuing need for DFAS system support. DFAS-I&amp;T-CO provides DFAS with software and technology support. I&amp;T-CO supports the DFAS mission and other selected outside customers. The implementation of DFAS standard systems requires project and program management support, analytical, technical, and programming support as well as the writing of programs to support database administration. Due to varying systems requirements, several types of abilities are required for the required tasks. Systems analysis skills are required for a variety of languages and processes. Technical analysis of hardware platforms including mainframe, mid-tier, as well as personal computers, is also needed. This Task Order will provide I&amp;T-CO with contractor support for the following systems: Defense Property Accountability System (DPAS), Mechanization of Contract Administration System (MOCAS) to include all interfacing systems to MOCAS such as, Standard Contract Reconciliation Tool (SCRT) and Entitlements Automation System (EAS); and various Accounting and Finance Systems such as Defense Business management System (DBMS), Defense Disbursing Analysis Reporting System (DDARS), Electronic Business (e-Biz), 1099 Tax Reporting Program (1099), Information Management and Tracking System (IMATS), Document Tracking Log (DTL), Vendor Pay Inquiry System (my Invoice), Human Resources Information Systems (HRIS), and small side projects such as the DFAS.mil Web Redesign for DFAS and assistance of an ERP Enterprise Performance Management Tool (EPMT) for SBM. In addition, there may be support required for other I&amp;T-CO systems, but this option under the Task Order will only be used if required by the government. <br /><br />4. PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>The DFISS III BPAs were awarded just so the activities requiring these services could depend on the consistency of one company for a period of five years. The BPAs were competed and awards were based on best value factors including technical experience, past performance, management, staffing, and cost/price. Per FAR 8.405-3(c)(2), all new requirements will be initially competed between the four BPA holders. The BPA terms specified that subsequent awards for the same services will not be recompeted, but logical follow-on orders will be awarded after a determination of satisfactory performance has been made.</p>
<p>In this case, HP (formerly EDS) is the incumbent. HP currently has a staff of 17 contractors. This staff supports a number of systems for I&amp;T-CO and DFAS. I&amp;T-CO relies on the staff for their technical qualifications and system knowledge and cannot risk the personnel disruption of a recompetition every year. The primary reason for establishing a five-year BPA with the understanding that follow-on orders would be awarded was to avoid the risk of the learning curve, as well as improving staff retention. One of the subfactors in the BPA evaluation was staff retention.</p>
<p>5. DETERMINATION OF BEST VALUE</p>
<p>The award of the initial task order for I&amp;T-CO was competed between the four BPA holders on a best value basis. HP was awarded that order. Per the terms of the BPA, a logical follow-on will be awarded.</p>
<p>6. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET SURVEY</p>
<p>The market survey for the BPA competition revealed numerous companies with potential capability for these services. The BPA RFQ was posted on GSA e-Buy for all qualified companies to consider. Five quotes were received. Four BPAs were awarded. The BPA holders have included numerous small and small disadvantaged businesses in their portfolios to use in conjunction with their own capabilities.</p>
<p>7. ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS</p>
<p>This order must be issued on a limited-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the BPA. Initially all FSS 70 schedule holders were provided fair opportunity to establish a BPA. In turn, all BPA awardees were then given a fair opportunity to be considered for the initial task order. The use of a logical follow-on is justified because the same work is continuing and there is a continuing need for contractor support. The inclusion of priced options was not considered viable since the Statement of Work (SOW) is updated from year to year which results in different numbers of hours per labor category. The requiring activity is not capable of projecting what the upcoming year estimates will be; therefore, priced options could not be evaluated for the initial award. The SOW changes from year to year are within scope of the base year, in that as some system work is minimized, other systems may be bolstered.</p>
<p>8. ACTIONS TAKEN TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION (Efforts to obtain competition)</p>
<p>See Paragraph 6 above. The BPA awards were competed and resulted in pricing below the GSA schedule; then, the initial task order awards were competed between the BPA holders resulting in further reduction in rates. The BPA instructions notified the holders that subsequent task orders for the same services would not be recompeted, but that logical follow-ons would be awarded.</p>
