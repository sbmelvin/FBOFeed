<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">The Government is preparing to issue a Performance Based Logistics contract to provide for supply of Secondary Power System (SPS) - Power Take Off (PTO) shafts to support F-15, F16, B1-B and B-2 weapon Platforms with five total shafts. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">This effort is for repair and/or acquisition of PTO Shafts and B-1B Crossover Shaft to support the Secondary Power Systems (SPS) of the B-1B, B-2, F-15, and F-16. There is a potential for this requirement to include F-22 support as well. This effort will be accomplished through a Performance Based Logistics (PBL) type contract. The goal is to improve the material/component parts availability, delivery, quality, cost savings and increase reliability of PTO Shafts. This PBL effort is applicable to, but not limited to, PTO Shafts for the following aircrafts: B-1, B-2, F-15, F-16, and potentially the F-22. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">The PTO and Crossover Shafts are components of the B-1, B-2, F-15, F-16, and potentially the F-22 SPS. The PTO Shafts are used to transfer power between the SPS to the aircraft main engines. The B-1B Crossover Shaft transfers power from the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) to the Right Hand Auxiliary Drive Gearbox (RHADG) of the B-1B SPS. The B-2 Power Take-off Shaft (PTS) transfers power between the B-2 AMAD (Aircraft Mounted Accessory Drive) and the aircraft main engine. Repair/manufacture of the Shafts must comply with the respective drawings and specifications: </span></p>

<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%">A central tenant of PBL is a contractor who is responsible for all performance outcomes. The contractor must have the necessary design, manufacturing, production, and process data capable to provide the performance outcomes, predetermined levels of availability (e.g. delivery within 2-4 days CONUS, 5 days OCONUS, etc.), reliability increases from technology insertion, and engineering for design changes. The essence of this PBL is buying performance outcomes, not the individual parts and repair actions. Instead of buying set levels of spares, repairs, tools, and data, the new focus is on buying predetermined level of availability and increased performance of the PTO Shafts to meet the warfighters objectives. The success of this PBL concept is based on the contractors efforts such as (to name a few), building a better system, modifying an existing system, improving the logistic support organization, spares optimization, etc. </span></p>

However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm listed.

The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a full and open competition Request for Proposal (RFP) to support National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) /Influenza Division. This will be a follow-on requirement to a previous National Immunization Survey Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) single award contract. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be cost plus fixed fee and firm fixed price types. The period of performance of sixty (60) months is anticipated. The applicable NAICS code is 541910. The RFP will be posted on FedBizOpps and is expected to be released on or about May 15, 2017. Interested parties are responsible for checking the website regularly for release of the RFP and for other procurement-related documents. TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The information provided in this pre-solicitation is for information purposes only. If there are any differences in the information provided here and the actual solicitation when released, the information provided in the actual solicitation shall govern.
<p>Background and Need <br />The National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Immunization Services Division (ISD), a center of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), require the planning and conduct of the National Immunization Survey (NIS) and related tasks.<br />Vaccination for childhood diseases has proven to be one of the most effective public health measures available. This has been shown through the reduction in the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases throughout the United States. The adoption of laws for vaccinations as a requirement for school entry has been credited with high vaccination levels in this population. The 1989-1990 measles outbreak in the United States brought into focus the public health problem of under-vaccination among preschool children. Healthy People 2020 objectives for immunization and infectious diseases include reaching high proportions of children receiving recommended vaccinations by their second birthday and adolescents receiving additional recommended vaccinations by 13-15 years of age.</p>
<p>In 1992, the 50 States and 28 local areas were awarded grants to improve the vaccination levels of children by their second birthday, and improve related service delivery, information and education, and assessment activities. Each grantee area developed an Immunization Action Plan (IAP) for the use of these funds and proposed approaches to improve the immunization delivery system in their areas (referred to as IAP areas). Determination of vaccination levels and changes over time was necessary for monitoring the success of the grants to these IAP areas.</p>
<p>The NIS was established in response to the immediate and continuing need for quality and timely data pertaining to the vaccination coverage of pre-school children across the United States. Beginning in 1994, in addition to national vaccination coverage data collected via the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the NCHS and the National Immunization Program (NIP), which is now NCIRD, began collecting vaccination information for children 19-35 months in these 78, non-overlapping geographic IAP areas across the United States via the NIS, based on a random-digit-dial (RDD) landline telephone sample of households with immunization provider record check verification. This information has been used to monitor the need for vaccinations among 19-35 month old children in each IAP area and nationally in the civilian noninstitutionalized population.</p>
<p>During 2005 and 2006, some of the non-grantee IAP areas were rotated off the survey (no longer oversampled) to allow new selected sub-state areas to be oversampled. Starting with 2007 data collection, the 22 IAP areas that did not receive direct Section 317 immunization grant funding from CDC were no longer automatically oversampled. Starting in 2007, state immunization programs were offered the opportunity to direct grant funds to oversample sub-state areas of their choice. This change resulted in core NIS data collection in 56 non-overlapping, geographically defined Local Sampling Areas (LSAs), including the 50 states and six urban areas that receive Section 317 immunization grant funding directly from CDC (District of Columbia; City of Chicago, IL; City of New York, NY; Philadelphia County, PA; Bexar County, TX; and City of Houston, TX). Additional sub-state areas and U.S.-affiliated jurisdictions may be added and may vary from year to year.</p>
<p>By 2006, three new vaccines had been licensed and recommended for routine use in adolescents: meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4), tetanus, diphtheria, acelluar pertussis (Tdap), and (for girls) quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4). In the 4th quarters of 2006 and 2007, the NIS-Teen was conducted using the NIS sampling frame and methods to estimate vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13-17 years. In 2008, the NIS-Teen sample was expanded to provide estimates for the 56 core NIS LSA's, and starting in 2009 additional sub-state areas were added at the request of some states. It is possible that CDC may need to change the age range of children included in the NIS in the future.<br />The NIS has periodically added topical modules to the household interview to collect additional vaccine-related information as needed by CDC. A health insurance module to determine status of eligibility for the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) was added in 2003 and became part of the core NIS survey in 2006. Recent modules have included expanded questions related to socioeconomic status and parental hesitancy to vaccinate their children. Surveys of adult vaccination were conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2007. During October 2009-June 2010, questions were asked of children of all ages identified during NIS screening to monitor seasonal and monovalent 2009 (H1N1) influenza vaccinations. These data were combined with a stand-alone dual frame landline and cell phone RDD influenza vaccination survey to comprise the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS). For subsequent influenza seasons, this data collection, called NIS-Flu, has continued each October through June for children aged 6 months through 17 years. Collectively, the data collected from the same sample frame consisting of children 19-35 months (NIS core), 13-17 years (NIS-Teen), and 6 months - 17 years (NIS-Flu) is described as the NIS Family of Surveys.<br />Research to improve the validity of survey estimates and effectiveness and efficiency of survey operations has been integral to the NIS since its inception. In recent years, declining willingness of the public to participate in surveys and changes in households' use of the telephone has resulted in declining response rates in the NIS and other surveys. Of particular concern is the increasing prevalence of households that have substituted their landline telephone for wireless service only. Over 40% of children aged 19-35 months may not be reachable by a landline survey. Addition of a cellular telephone sampling frame was piloted in 2010 and incorporated into the NIS starting in 2011 <br />(http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/nis/child/dual-frame-sampling.html). <br />Other research has investigated the potential role of Immunization Information Systems (IIS) in the conduct of the NIS. IIS are confidential, population-based, computerized databases that record all immunization doses administered by participating providers to persons residing within a given geopolitical area. At the point of clinical care, an IIS can provide consolidated immunization histories for use by a vaccination provider in determining appropriate client vaccinations. At the population level, an IIS provides aggregate data on vaccinations for use in surveillance and program operations, and in guiding public health action with the goals of improving vaccination rates and reducing vaccine-preventable disease. IIS exist in most states, but vary in their level of child and provider participation, completeness of vaccination histories, and completeness and accuracy of household contact information. With continued development of IIS and increased use of electronic medical record systems and their integration into IIS, they may eventually replace the role of NIS in providing timely, valid and comparable estimates of vaccination coverage across state and local areas. In the shorter term, NIS and NIS-Teen samples have been matched to selected IIS to compare vaccination histories reported by both, and the potential use of IIS as a sampling frame, as a supplement to or in place of a telephone sample, has also been evaluated. Substantial efficiencies could be gained using IISs to supplement or replace the current NIS RDD telephone sampling frame. Further work is needed to define when an IIS is ready to be used as a sample frame, identify legal and policy barriers to data sharing, and assess willingness and resources needed by states to participate. The potential role of IIS to improve the efficiency of the NIS provider record check has also been evaluated.<br />Project Objective <br />The NIS contract will obtain a contractor to conduct the NIS and other related research tasks through the issuance of individual task orders. The objective of the NIS is to produce annual estimates of the proportion of noninstitutionalized children 19 through 35 months and 13 through 17 years receiving vaccinations recommended by the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), in each of the nonoverlapping LSAs. It is also intended to describe sociodemographic disparities in vaccination coverage, factors that influence the vaccination status of children, the uptake of newly recommended vaccines, and how information about immunization is understood by the public. The objective for other related research is to: assess influenza vaccination utilization and related information during annual influenza seasons; assess additional vaccination-related information from children or adults of any age in response to emerging program needs; and improve efficiency, quality and validity of NIS.<br />Scope of Work <br />Project objectives will be achieved through issuance of firm fixed price or cost plus fixed fee task orders to conduct survey activities that are organized into the following subject areas:</p>
<p>a. NIS Core. Collection of vaccination data for children aged 19-35 months in each of at least 56 state and local areas of the United States.</p>
<p>b. NIS-Teen. Collection of vaccination data for adolescents aged 13-17 years using the same sample as the NIS, in each of at least 56 state and local areas of the United States.</p>
<p>c. Influenza Vaccination Surveys (children 6 months to 7 years). Collection of data related to influenza vaccination among persons of all ages.</p>
<p>d. Optional Vaccination-related Modules. Collection of additional vaccination-related data for children eligible for the NIS or NIS-Teen, NIS-Flu or from other age groups of children or adults, using the same sample as the NIS, or using separate, stand-alone sampling frames.</p>
<p>e. Operational Methods Research. Evaluation, research and experiments to improve efficiency, quality and validity of NIS. <br />Period of Performance <br />The period of performance for issuance of task orders against the IDIQ contract is a base period of one year and four one-year option periods. Individual periods of performance will be specified per each task order. <br />Technical Requirements <br />Task orders will be issued by NCIRD under the following general categories:</p>
<p>a. NIS Core. Collection of vaccination data for children aged 19-35 months in each of at least 56 state and local areas of the United States.</p>
<p>The NIS Core Task Orders will involve: 1) the design and conduct of quarterly/annual surveys to be fielded in each of the LSAs collecting data from the families of age-eligible children in RDD interviews for specified data years; 2) collecting data from the medical providers reported for those children (with oral consent from the parent or guardian); 3) combining the information from the responding providers and families to produce improved vaccination estimates comparable over time; 4) other data collections; 5) performing descriptive analyses of the data collected; 6) preparing computer files from edited survey data and reports documenting the files and the survey data collection methods and process results, and 7) performance monitoring and quality improvement efforts to assess and improve data quality and survey efficiency.</p>
<p>A NIS data year refers to one calendar year, January 1 - December 31, during which quarterly samples of landline and cellular telephone numbers are dialed to identify households with age-eligible children and conduct NIS interviews. Associated with each data year are approximately three prior months for planning (October - December), 12 months for household data collection, and approximately nine subsequent months to complete household interviews, complete follow-up of medical providers, prepare and deliver restricted access and public use data files, and final reports. For example, NIS data year 2018 includes activities that would span from approximately October 2017 through December 2019. NIS data year 2019 would span from approximately October 2018 through December 2020. Thus, activities associated with separate Task Orders for consecutive NIS data years would overlap in their period of performance.</p>
<p>b. NIS-Teen. Collection of vaccination data for adolescents aged 13-17 years using the same sample as the NIS, in each of at least 56 state and local areas of the United States. Survey procedures are generally similar to those required to conduct the core NIS.</p>
<p>c. Influenza Vaccination Surveys (children 6 months to 7 years). Collection of data related to influenza vaccination among persons of all ages.</p>
<p>Task orders in this category may include influenza modules asked of children of any age identified during NIS screening, and general population surveys using an independent sample conducted continuously or periodically during the vaccination period, typically during October through June. CDC may use this contract for annual monitoring of influenza vaccination, with expanded approaches implemented as needed in emergent situations (e.g., pandemic influenza, shortage of influenza vaccine).</p>
<p>d. Optional Vaccination-related Modules. Collection of additional vaccination-related data for children eligible for the NIS or NIS-Teen, or NIS-Flu from other age groups of children or adults, using the same sample as the NIS, or using separate, stand-alone sampling frames.</p>
<p>Short (e.g., approximately 5 minutes) survey modules may be added to the end of the NIS, NIS-Teen, or NIS-Flu survey to collect additional vaccination related information (e.g., parental attitudes toward childhood vaccination). Task orders in this category may also include vaccination-related surveys using the NIS sampling frame, or separate, standalone sampling frames, to obtain parental information regarding vaccination of children of any age, or to obtain information from persons &ge;18 years about their own vaccination-related behavior.</p>
<p>e. Research Tasks. Evaluation, research and experiments to improve efficiency, quality and validity of NIS.</p>
<p>Task orders in this category may include experiments to test modifications of survey instruments, survey operations and procedures, designing more efficient or valid sample designs (e.g., improved telephone sample design, switch to an address-based sample frame, or incorporating IIS as a NIS sample frame), and matching of NIS and NIS-Teen samples with IIS to evaluate completeness of IIS and NIS vaccination data. To the extent possible, changes in NIS design, methods, and operations are tested and evaluated before and after implementation, to ensure continuity in validity of estimates over time.</p>
<p>In general, the contractor's responsibilities include such activities as:<br />&bull; Questionnaire design and testing;<br />&bull; Survey instrument modification if necessary and approved by CDC;<br />&bull; Sampling plan, design, and selection;<br />&bull; Preparation of the survey questionnaire(s) and other necessary data collection materials;<br />&bull; Recruitment, training and performance monitoring of interviewers;<br />&bull; Administration of telephone, mail surveys, and web surveys for providers;<br />&bull; Development of weighting procedures and implementation of estimators;<br />&bull; Design and implementation of quality control procedures;<br />&bull; Conversion of data on paper forms into machine readable form;<br />&bull; Preparation of field and methodological reports;<br />&bull; Preparation of verified, edited, and documented data files (on tape or other electronic format acceptable to the Contracting Officer's Representative {COR});<br />&bull; Preparation of materials for submission to the ERB;<br />&bull; Methodological Studies; and<br />&bull; Other activities essential for the successful completion of the project.</p>
<p>Place of Performance <br />Services will be performed at vendor specified site in the United States. All aspects of work related to this contract must be performed in the U. S., this includes work performed by the Contractor and any sub-contractors. For individual task orders, some work may be conducted in the U.S.-affiliated jurisdictions (e.g., United States Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico) at the specific request of the COR.<br />Reporting Schedule <br />Contractor reporting requirements will be defined in each individual task order. Reports may include weekly, monthly, or quarterly reports, along with a final report. <br />Travel <br />Any required travel will be identified on individual task orders as necessary. The Contractor shall coordinate all travel requirements with the CDC Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and obtain written approval from the Contracting Officer prior to beginning such travel.<br />Government will reimburse the Contractor for travel related costs.

This is a market survey for information and comments from industry that will aid in the formation of an acquisition strategy for an Infrastructure Remediation (construction) contract vehicle in support of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and potentially other FAA Logistics Center customers.  The resultant contract vehicle could be a multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, or multiple Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) based on geographical regions (especially along the Northern and Southern borders of the U.S.).  Existing FAA BOAs for construction will be used to the maximum extent.  The draft requirements (for CBP support) are identified in the attached Infrastructure Remediation Contract Statement of Work (SOW).  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.

The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from all businesses that are interested in and capable of providing the required construction support.  This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the potential acquisition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and size standards for this effort:

NAICS		Size Standard
237990		$36.5M

The contractor will supply personnel and resources necessary to provide the construction support in accordance with the attached draft SOW.

Interested firms are required to submit a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.

The FAA requires the following (limited to 30 pages) from interested vendors in accordance with the attached draft SOW:
 
1. Capability Statement - This document should identify: 
      - Type of supplies and services provided by your firm
      - Size and type of supplies/services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance)                                
      - Number of years in business

2.  Clearly state whether or not you can provide all of the types of services listed in the draft SOW. 

3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned and 8(a) certified businesses.

All responses to this market survey must be received by 4:00 p.m. CST, 12 Jan 2018.  The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following:

This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specified on a source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the intended application. Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be economically obtained. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<SUBJECT>16--Synopsis for Four Year Performance Based Logistics contract in Support of the F/A-18A-F and E/A-18G Heads Up Display as well as several other Common Aircraft components

<RESPDATE>011818

<CONTACT>Megan Kelly 215-697-2533
<DESC>NAVSUP Weapon System Support plans to award a four year Performance Based Logistics contract for the F-18 Heads Up Display (HUD) as well as several Common aircraft components listed in the attachment below to Rockwell Collins (Cage Code 13499) in Cedar Rapids, Iowa in October 2018.  Under the anticipated contract, the contractor will stock, warehouse, repair, modify and/or replace, store and provide for shipment Ready-for-Issue (RFI) condition assets within negotiated contractor response times.  The PBL contract will require an integrated product life cycle approach whereby the contractor assumes responsibility for many management and support functions related to the PBL such as engineering and logistics support.
  Rockwell will be required to meet established response times through Weapons Replaceable Unit (WRA)/Shop Repairable Unit (SRA) repair and replacement, reliability oversight, and inventory, configuration and obsolescence management.  The proposed contract will also include a reliability metric.

The contractor will be required to partner with organic depots such as FRC-SE (Jacksonville) and FRC-SW (North Island) in accordance with Title 10 United States Code requirements and to renew and/or execute new Commercial Services Agreements and/or Public-Private Cooperative Arrangements.

The maximum period of performance for this effort will not exceed 4 years.  Justification for Sole Source Acquisition: the statutory authority applicable to permit other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C.
 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) and (iii) with only responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.  Absent interest/approval of additional sources, the Government intends to negotiate a contract with  Rockwell Collins, Cage Code 13499, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the components to be covered under this PBL contract.  Rockwell is the only source with the engineering expertise and technical data necessary to perform essential PBL tasks such as repair, resolution of obsolescence issues, sustainment of reliability, and management of configuration of the Navys Critical Application Item WRAs/SRAs covered by the contemplated procurement.
  Further, only Rockwell owns the necessary design, configuration, manufacturing, production, and process data required to implement the necessary reliability sustainment/improvements.  In addition, only Rockwell has access to the original design data/OEM intellectual property.  

Even though the requirement has been designated sole source, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  For any questions concerning this notice, contact the PCO, Megan Kelly at Megan.E.Kelly@navy.mil.

The subject items require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the items are flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support repair via full and open competition.
  Only the source previously approved by the Government for repair of these items, Rockwell Collins 13499, will be solicited.  The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.  If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair.  This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in repair of the same or similar items. This brochure is included as an attachment below.  If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter that forwarded your request for source approval.
  Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.  

Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.  

Subcontracting Opportunities: All businesses interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Rockwell Collins.

<DESC>The Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District intends to award a Firm Fixed Price Contract for the Welch Elementary School/Dover Air Base Middle School Replacement at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware (a restricted access installation).
<p>The work includes construction of a new combined elementary/middle school facility, located at Dover Air Force Base, DE. The new facility will be constructed adjacent to the existing elementary/middle school. The multistory structure will be comprised of approximately 105,550 square feet. The project will utilize clear span (up to 65') or similar construction methods to allow large, open, flexible spaces and will incorporate fully integrated acoustical rated operable wall partitions which contribute to the overall acoustical performance of the building.</p>
<p>The facility will include several spaces with a required STC rating of 60 and numerous spaces with STC ratings of 45 so proper implementation of the acoustical design is a significant aspect of the new school. The school will include 21st Century School concepts such as learning neighborhoods, central hubs surrounded by learning studios, flex labs, science labs, information center, gymnasium, food service area, computer lab, supply areas, specialist rooms, art rooms, music rooms, a performance/commons/dining area, learning impaired rooms, teacher work rooms, counseling areas, storage, administrative offices and other required areas for a fully functioning facility. The school will include several technical items not found in standard administrative facilities such as demonstration PV panels, demonstration weather station, and solar hot water collection; all of which will be connected to an energy dashboard which will display information from these features.</p>
<p>The lighting, water use, and HVAC systems will also require data monitoring points and will also be connected to the energy dashboard. The contract will require proper implementation of safety and security features including providing and installing blast resistant windows in large storefront glass areas for the exterior. Interior corridor glass will meet security requirements with one-minute delay glass. The contract also includes related infrastructure such as parking areas, mechanical rooms, delivery areas, covered walkways, playgrounds and site improvements. The facility will require enhanced commissioning upon completion to validate energy performance and must obtain LEED Silver certification.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the construction of the new facility, the contract will require complete demolition (approx. 126,000 sf) of the existing school (including handling and disposal of limited quantities of asbestos containing materials) and associated site restoration.</p>
<p>The contract will require the contractor to perform the new construction and demolition in phases. The construction site is adjacent to an active school campus and the contractor will be required to ensure site safety and prevent student and public access. School functions will not be interrupted which could require after hours utility connections and/or scheduling weekend work for noise disturbances that could affect student testing. This will ensure current school functions are continuous and not disrupted during construction.</p>
<p>The contract duration for both new construction and demolition is 730-calendar days.</p>
<p>This will be an Unrestricted Sealed Bid solicitation for full &amp; open competition (both large &amp; small businesses). Estimated cost range of the project is $25,000,000 and $100,000,000. Performance and Payment Bonds will be required for 100% of contract award. The NAICS Code for this project is 236220 and the small business size standard is $36.5 Million.</p>
<p>The Request for Proposals W912BU-17-R-0032 will be issued on or about 07 November 2017 with a proposal due date of 11 January 2018 at 1400 EST hours (2:00 p.m.); however this information is subject to change. Offerors should review the entire solicitation once it is posted.</p>
<p>An "Industry Day" designed to showcase this project as well as other contracting opportunities on Dover AFB is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon on Friday, October 20, 2017 at The Air Mobility Command Museum Conference Room, 1301 Heritage Road, Dover AFB, DE 19902-5301. This event is OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. The museum is outside of the restricted area of Dover AFB.</p>

The RFCM System is a fully integrated single-system Electronic Warfare (EW) suite for the AFSOC AC/MC-130J aircraft. The system provides detection avoidance navigation/threat avoidance navigation and terminal defense for the aircraft. Specifically, the SPARTA software requirements include the following developmental testing support for the RFCM System: setting up a SPARTA software package for specific RFCM test scenarios, developing models/expected results/tolerances for RFCM testing, running SPARTA analysis software against data sets provided by the RFCM team, and generating electronic countermeasure reports/graphs. The RFCM government team requires SPARTA software to provide accurate fidelity of real time electronic countermeasure analyses. The acquisition strategy is to use Simplified Acquisition Procedures (FAR Part 13) to award a 6 month Firm Fixed Price contract (FFP) to SWRI by 31 March 2018.</p>
<p>Planned Requirements:</p>
<p>- Development of models</p>
<p>- Expected results/tolerances for RFCM testing</p>
<p>- Running analysis software against I/Q data sets provided by RFCM personnel</p>
<p>- Generation of reports/graphs required by RFCM personnel</p>
<p>Planned Period of Performance: March 2018-October 2018</p>
<p>Limitations: RFCM Developmental testing requires automated and manual real-time electronic warfare analysis using SPARTA software.</p>

General

The VA Medical Center, Bath, New York is engaging in a short-list selection as defined in FAR 36.602-5(a) of an AE (SDVOSB) for the design of a project for Chiller and NCC Replacement, B-76.  SDVOSB Vendors with an SF-330 on file within the past twelve months are being considered. If you believe you have an SF 330 on file and would like to be considered for this procurement please send an e-mail to Mark.Simonson@va.gov expressing your interest in being considered.  Other SDVOSB firms having a working office within a 300 mile radius from 76 Veterans Avenue, Bath, NY may submit SF 330 s for consideration, to the Contracting Officer at Mark.Simonson@va.gov by 4:30 PM EST, January 17, 2018.

This project is to prepare plans and specifications to replace two single pass chillers. One is still functioning and the other has completely failed. The selected A/E will be required to perform a heating and cooling load analysis of the areas served by the existing chillers. The results of this analysis will be used to size and select a single air cooled chiller to replace the two existing chillers. Basis of design for this unit will be Trane. The A/E will then be required to prepare a pumping and piping plan for the new chiller that connects the two existing systems. The design provided by the A/E shall include tying the new chiller into the facilities existing building automation system.  All newly installed building communication systems must be BAC net certified. Finally, the A/E will site the new chiller in as convenient a spot as possible. Because this work will most likely be done during the cooling season, a phasing plan will be required. Also, because the areas served by the two existing chillers are essential to the operation of B76, a quick design turn-around time is necessary. 
 In addition to the above, the A/E will be required to size and select a Motor Control Center (MCC) to replace an existing Federal Pacific MCC manufactured in 1984. The A/E shall verify the existing loads on the MCC and measure each incoming load to size the new load center. The new MCC shall be tied into the existing building automation system. All newly installed building communication systems must be BAC net certified.
 All designs will ensure that the VHA policy for HVAC requirements meets or exceeds current industry code, standards, and requirements for RME reprocessing and storage. These shall include, but are not limited to, VA Space Planning Specifications, the Interim Memorandum, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, standard #ST79:  Comprehensive guide to steam sterilization and sterility assurance in health care facilities and the American Society of Heating and Air Conditioning Engineers in conjunction with the VA Master specifications as outlined in VA Handbook 7610.  The design will also be done to ensure that it meets all the requirements and specifications for local, state, and federal building codes. The estimated construction cost for the design must fall within the VA budget.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT
<p>This RFI seeks to discover sources which can perform abstract of title and reporting services to obtain water rights information for a specific piece of land located within the county of Siskiyou in the state of California. <em>Expedited</em> completion of services is of great importance.</p>
<p>The Forest Service intends to purchase land within the aforementioned area. The company with exclusive rights to the title plant potentially containing information required for the sale is <em>Mount Shasta Title and Escrow</em>. Utilization of standard information retrieval directly from the title company by the Government will not meet timeline needs, so a title abstractor's services are required.</p>
<p>Title abstractors appropriate for this requirement:<br />-Must have or be able to obtain access to information held by the aforementioned title company;<br />-Would need to perform research tasks on-site at the title company;<br />-Would ideally have past experience abstracting information in the given area so as to be knowledgeable of requirements, policy, geographic data and other facts inherent to the area;<br />-Must have experience abstracting water right information;<br />-Must be able to guarantee completion of finalized deliverable (Ownership Report) within two weeks of award to meet escrow closing date.</p>
<p>Sources potentially interested in and apparently qualified for this project should contact Sandra Vincent at svincent02@fs.fed.us by the FRI closing date of January 10, 2018 at 12:00 noon Pacific Time.</p>

The United States Army National Guard Operational Contracting Branch, NGB-AQ, is seeking information on potential sources and industry feedback on the attached Draft Performance Work Statements for MILCON Consolidated Professional Services.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only, to identify potential sources capable of providing services for multiple locations within the United States in accordance with Department of Defense standards and applicable local, state, and Federal laws.  This requirement is a follow-on effort to an existing contract, W9133L-15-C-0081 and W9133L-15-C-0081 with RCC-JGMS JV.  Information regarding this contracts can be found within the FPDS-NG website.  The Government intends to consolidate the efforts of the two contracts listed.</p>
<p><br />TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p><br />The Draft Performance Work Statement has all of the information listed in regards to the technical requirements for this effort.  As a reminder, these are drafts and estimates which are subject to be changed.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement 541611 Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.</p>
<p>The SBA Size Standard is $15,000,000.00.</p>
<p>The Product Service Code (PSC) for this requirement is R499 - Administrative management: and General Management Consulting Services.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action.  All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DOD contract and with their local SBA office.  Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.  The Army National Guard anticipates an acquisition for a base and two option years.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary.  This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice.  Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any Government assessments.  The Government's assessment of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business program.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>1. The information below provides a "Contractor Capability Survey" to allow you to document your company's capabilities in meeting these requirements.</p>
<p>2. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, please complete and return the Contractor Capability Survey below.  Response format and due date information is specified at the bottom portion of this notice.  Failure to provide a complete response may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities.  If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)</p>
<p>3. This sources sought inquiry is for all potential vendors.</p>

<p>Attention: Small business respondents who are interested in submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for this effort: The acquisition strategy for this requirement has not been decided; however, the Army National Guard is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for small businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability.  Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that two or more small business prime contractors must be capable of providing at least 50% of the entire scope of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Attention all potential respondents: If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract may contain a small business utilization requirement. Please provide feedback on what areas of this requirement are likely candidates for small business subcontracting.</p>
<p>Part II. Request for Information:<br />If possible, please provide answers to the following questions.</p>
<p>1. Are there specific requirements in the documentation that has the effect of limiting competition among potential vendors?</p>
<p>2. Is there an alternate NAICS that you believe is more appropriate for this requirement?  If so, what is the NAICS and why?</p>
<p>3. Is there anything in the PWS that has the effect of creating duplicative of unnecessary costs to the Government?  Do you have any additional comments on the PWS?</p>
<p>4. Based on your experience, are the requested services commercial in nature as defined by FAR 2.101?  If so, why, and are there established catalog or market prices for these services?</p>
<p>5.  What efficiencies and cost savings would the Government save through the consolidation of the two contracts?  What estimated amount each year do you think the Government would save and in the consolidation?  What's your company's rationale for this amount?</p>
<p><br />CAPABILITIES PACKAGE:</p>

<p><br />DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>SPECIFICATIONS<br />Two External-cavity diode laser systems and a Wavelength meter<br />NB688000-18-00548</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Time and Frequency Metrology Group is part of the Time &amp; Frequency Division of the Physical Measurement Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Our group performs optical phase and frequency measurements using stabilized lasers. Of interest is the generation of low phase noise microwave signals referenced to optical references via femtosecond frequency combs. The two External-cavity diode laser (ECDL) systems and Wavelength meter (WM) will be used to develop an optical reference based on two-photon transitions in Rubidium.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:<br />We plan to develop a Rubidium optical frequency reference based on two laser systems. The reference requires the lasers systems to operate at 780nm and 776nm, respectively, and deliver &gt;100mW per system with &lt;50kHz linewidth. To explore the wavelength parameter space, the laser systems need to be tunable within 40nm spectral range around a center wavelength of 785nm. The wavelengths will be calibrated with the Wavelength meter to &plusmn;0.2ppm or &plusmn;60MHz @ 780nm.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLES: <br />Two External-cavity diode laser systems and a Wavelength meter.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: <br />Two External-cavity diode laser systems:<br />- center wavelength: 785nm<br />- wavelength tunability range: 40nm (765-805nm)<br />- power output after optical isolation stage: &gt;100mW<br />- short-term linewidth: &lt;50kHz <br />- polarization-maintaining fiber-coupler<br />- frequency locking option (top of fringe) for both piezo and current channels<br />Wavelength meter:<br />- range: 500-1000nm<br />- accuracy: &plusmn;0.2ppm or &plusmn;60MHz @ 780nm<br />- input: fiber-coupled, CW input power &lt;0.5mW<br />- measurement speed &gt;100Hz<br />- solid-state (no moving parts)</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS: <br />The Rubidium reference requires laser sources with very narrow linewidth (&lt;50kHz). The two-laser concept requires wide wavelength tunability range (40nm). The two-photon optical reference also requires significant laser power (&gt;100mW) due to the low transition probability. The only single-laser systems offering simultaneously narrow linewidth, wide wavelength tunability range and output power exceeding 100mW are External-cavity diode laser systems. The wavemeter should not have moving parts, as it is expected the system will be tested for robustness.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT FURNISHED PROPERTY OR INFORMATION: <br />The laser systems and the Wavelength meter will interface an existing laser system from the Toptica, for which software control is developed. To assure software compatibility, it is essential that the Wavelength meter is from the same vendor. Resources developed at NIST for Toptica Photonics products (there are multiple groups using the same or similar Toptica Photonics products) will thus also be compatible.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLE SCHEDULE:<br />Delivery time should be between 6-12 weeks.</p>
<p>INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE: <br />End user will inspect and test the merchandise upon delivery. The merchandise should perform according to specifications.</p>

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security. 

2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
a. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order. 
b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. 
c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness. 
d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor. 
e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor s employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination. 

3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE 
a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1). 
b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor s information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA s information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA s sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements. 
c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA.

Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract. 
d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract. 
e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. 

f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 

g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship. 
h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated. 
i. The contractor/subcontractor s firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA s minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request. 
j.

The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response. 
k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response. 
l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR. 





6. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION 

a. The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access. 
b.

c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement. 
d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident. 

7. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH 
a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. 
b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a  security incident  as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination. 
c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following: 

(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access); 

(2) Description of the event, including: 
(a) date of occurrence; 
(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code; 

(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected; 

(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected; 

(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text; 

(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control; 

(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons); 

(8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any; 
(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals; 
(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and 
(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised. 

d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $ 37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following: 

(1) Notification; 
(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports; 
(3) Data breach analysis; 
(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution; 
(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and 
(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs. 

8. SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING 

On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day s notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time. 

9. TRAINING

The basis for restricting competition is that ASC is the only responsible source capable of satisfying the agency's requirements and no other type of supplies will satisfy agency requirements. Award to any other source would result in duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement.</p>

<p>All interested parties are encouraged to submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than five pages in length, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description with performance parameters and a statement of current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, a budgetary estimate of test articles, production units, production quantity breaks, mitigate the reason why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above, and /or identify other Government contracts with similar efforts for the Government(s) consideration.</p>

<p>Submitter's Name<br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size<br />Point of Contact (POC)<br />POC Telephone<br />Announcement Number:</p>

This RFI/sources sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The US Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement. Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.</p>

<DESC><p>This Request for Information (RFI) is to determine the potential availability of existing (off-the-shelf) computer software that could be used for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) Portland and Walla Walla Districts adult fish counting program at eight mainstem Columbia and Snake River dams.</p>
<p>These Corps dams have fish ladders and associated facilities for passing adult salmon, steelhead, shad, lamprey, and other migrating and resident species. The Corps has specific requirements for counting adult fish passing at each of these projects. Fish counting services are currently being performed by a contractor under a base contract with two option years and is scheduled to expire February 2019. The currently used computer software is out-of-date and research is being done to find a suitable replacement.</p>
<p>At this time we are requesting information on commercially available, off-the-shelf computer software with the capabilities to satisfy fish counting needs. This information will be used so a decision can be made on what is the best method/software for a new fish counting contract.</p>
<p>Specifically, we are interested in software packages which can;</p>
<p>1. Be used by fish counting staff to record and archive hourly and daily numbers of fish of multiple species as they pass upstream (positive counts) and downstream (negative counts) at fish count stations at the dams.<br />2. Transmit net hourly counts at a set time daily to Corp's designated host for posting on publically-accessible internet websites, and <br />3. Archive counts for backup and long term records storage.</p>
<p>In addition, the Corps is interested in software that could automate processing video records of fish as they pass count stations at night and during winter months when count staff are not present. Examples of automated processing can include video compression (to eliminate blank frames) and pattern recognition (algorithms that use body morphology to identify and enumerate fish by species and age) techniques. Vendors would need to demonstrate that video processing software can differentiate among multiple species with a 95% accuracy.</p>
<p>Only firms that have or know of commercially available off-the-shelf computer software that could fulfill our requirement should respond to this announcement. This announcement is being used as market research and does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government in making appropriate acquisition decisions.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The NAICS code in 2017 changed from 541712 to 541715.</p>
<p><strong>Set-aside Status:</strong> The 2019 solicitation is scheduled to be issued as a Set-Aside 100% for Small Business concerns.

<DESC>Chapter VI: Other Than Full and Open Competition (OFOC) SOP Attachment 4: Single Source Justification for SAP under $150K
IAW FAR 13.104 COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FARI 3.106-1 (b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold. COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR 13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier. This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR 13.106-3(b)(3). Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.
1.ACQUISITION PLAN ACTION ID:

IA. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER N/A
1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT:



2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE: The VAMC SLC is required by directive to have a 10-day backup fuel supply for the Boiler Plant on-site at all times. This emergency contract is needed as a mitigation plan, as required by OCAMES, until the on-site storage capabilities are upgraded. This includes the acquisition of 30,548 gallons of Liquid Propane, stored in off-site storage location for 1 year, with option to extend an additional year if required. It also includes a service contract for "emergency" delivery within 24 hours of up to 9,000 gallons of stored Propane per day, until supply is depleted and "normal" delivery of balance of stored propane upon request.
3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:
This contractor has the resources available immediately to execute all aspects of this contract. They have all the fuel and storage capacity that we require, available immediately. They also have the logistical infrastructure to guarantee delivery of fuel when requested.
4. SUGGESTED SOURCE INFORMATION (Contractor Name, Address, City, state, Zip, and Telephone Number)
Pilot Thomas Logistics
1117 North 400 East
North Salt Lake, UT 84054
5. REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:
This contractor is our normal supplier of Liquid Propane for our back-up fuel station that supplies the Boiler Plant. Due to the time sensitive nature of meeting the requirements set forth by OCAMES, searching for additional contractors to provide this service at this time, is not feasible.

<p>252.204-7011 ALTERNATIVE LINE-ITEM STRUCTURE (SEP 2011)</p>
<p>(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal <br />Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to <br />ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.</p>

The amount listed by the offeror on this contract line item number (CLIN) is the
estimated DBA insurance premium (estimated payroll of the Offeror and its
subcontractors). The DBA insurance premium amount varies with payroll and the
nature of the services. The actual amount paid by the Government under this
CLIN will be based on the amount of the stamped PAID receipt from an
approved Department of Labor (DoL) insurance carrier and submitted by the
offeror after award for reimbursement. In the event premiums are recalculated by
the approved DoL insurance carrier based on actual payrolls, the contracting
officer will adjust the DBA cost CLIN amount to reflect the actual premium
amount paid. The U.S. Government will NOT reimburse the contractor for DBA
insurance purchased from a non-DoL approved insurance provider., 1, Lot;<BR><span class="label">LI 037: </span>***NON-PRICED CLIN***ATTENTION ALL OFFERORS: In order to bid on this solicitation, you MUST be registered and APPROVED in JCXS (https://www.jccs.gov/jccscoe/Default.aspx) and granted a unique number identifying your company.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>1. Background: This statement of work shall provide for Command Training Services for Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division (NSWC PHD) operations. The scope of the effort includes training support in the area of Command Interest and other supporting functions as outlined in this SOW.</p>
<p>2. Requirements: PHD has a requirement for a contractor to conduct 5 classes on FERS Pre Retirement Planning (each lasting 2 day). 1 class CSRS Pre Retirement (lasting 2 day), 4 TSP classes (each lasting 1 day). 35 students for each class.</p>
<p>3. FERS Pre Retirement Planning - Participants will receive all the information they need to understand, use, and integrate to make educated decisions regarding the FERS Retirement System for the FERS Annuity and the Phased Retirement, Social Security, the TSP, FSAs, FEGLI, FEHB to include FLTCIP, FEHB and FSAs to include integration of the Medical Care FSA, and the FLTCIP, to maximize their current and future financial benefit position using the Federal Employee Benefit Programs (FEBP). Instructor will addresses complex questions and individual concerns to augment the education process. Each class member will understand how to reach their retirement objectives by utilizing the information about the Federal Employees Benefit Programs addressed in our seminar.<br />CSRS Pre Retirement - Participants will receive all the information they need to understand, use, and integrate to make mid to short term educated decisions regarding the CSRS and CSRS Offset Retirement System to include the CSRS Annuity and the Phased Retirement, Social Security, the TSP, FEGLI, FEHB and FSAs to include integration of the Medical Care FSA, the FLTCIP, and Dependent Care FSA to maximize their current and future financial benefit position using the Federal Employee Benefit Programs (FEBP).<br />Managing Your Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) - is a very economical, efficient and safe way to save for retirement. Open to any permanent employee, it provides tax-deferred savings, a choice of several fund types, guaranteed security, and a very low-cost structure. Properly managed, the TSP can provide for an early, comfortable and secure retirement. If burdened by errors, mistakes and poor decision-making, it can fail, and waste investment dollars. While the TSP has many strong advantages, employees remain responsible for good account management, for timely decision-making, and for meeting key action deadlines. They must understand the many complicated rules and requirements involved, develop a personal strategy, and make a strong personal commitment to act in a timely and positive manner. This training program will provide attendees with a good understanding of plan operations, choices available, and sources of additional information. Attendees will be able to make decisions better suited to their personal goals and needs.</p>

<em>
<p>"<strong>Notice to Offeror(s)/Supplier(s): </strong>Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date for receipt of proposals. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs."</p>
</em>
<p>The 354th Contracting Squadron is seeking qualification packages and past performance information from vendors interested in providing professional engineering services at Eielson AFB, AK to replace the low voltage electrical panels, lighting and wiring throughout the Central Heat &amp; Power Plant (CH&amp;PP).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>A. The Central Heat and Power Plant (CH&amp;PP) is a coal-fired cogeneration power plant providing steam for district heat and electricity for the facilities on Eielson AFB. The plant was originally built in 1952 and has six floors (including the basement).</p>
<p>B. The majority of the low voltage (480V and lower voltage) electrical panels, lighting throughout the power plant and the interconnecting wiring are old and in poor condition. In addition, lighting levels in many parts of the plant are inadequate.</p>
<p>C. In 2012 and 2013, a design was produced for replacement of all of the lighting and lighting panels in the plant as well as in the cooling pond pump house and the ash silo building. At the end of the design, it was determined that the project was too costly and should be broken into three phases, however, funding was not available at the time to modify the existing design contract. The design consultant, however, did provide a rough phasing plan.</p>
<p>D. Since completion of the 2013 design, Boilers 5 and 6 at the plant have been replaced. As part of the boiler replacements, the lighting around those boilers has also been replaced, and other electrical changes have been made.</p>
<p>E. In 2017, a contract was awarded for design of the first phase of the lighting project. Phase A includes replacement of all lighting in the basement and on the first floor of the main plant. In addition, Phase A includes replacement of an automatic transfer switch, installation of a new battery back-up for the lighting, installation of lighting distribution panelboards, and installation of a 480V/277V transformer.</p>
<p>F. Almost all areas inside the plant are dusty. Many areas are classified as Class II, Div 1 or 2, Group F. In addition, many of the metal surfaces inside may be coated with lead-based paint and there may be asbestos containing materials in the project area.</p>
<p>PROJECT GOALS:</p>
<p>1. This will be the second phase of a three phase project to replace the existing lowvoltage electrical panels, lighting and wiring in the CH&amp;PP, ash silo building andcooling pond pump house. Primarily, the work of Phase B includes replacement ofthe lighting on all floors above the first floor of the main power plant building.</p>
<p>2. Hazardous materials abatement as necessary to complete the other work of theproject.</p>
<p>This is a competitive selection process in which competing offeror's qualifications will be evaluated in accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 36.6 to determine the most highly qualified firms. The Government intends to award one Firm Fixed-Price contract.</p>
<p>IAW FAR 36.603(b): To be considered for architect-engineer contracts, a firm must file with the appropriate office or board the Standard Form 330, "Architect-Engineer Qualifications," Part II and when applicable, SF 330, Part I. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this posting; all costs associated with responding will be solely at the interested parties' expense. Failure to respond to this post does not preclude participation in the subsequent technical evaluation so long as a firm's SF 330 is currently on file with the 354th Contracting Squadron. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be solicited on an unrestricted basis. The NAICS 541330 (Engineering Services) applies to this acquisition, with a small business size standard of $15M.</p>
<p>A. Tasks will include, but not be limited to:</p>
<p>1. Site investigation, investigation of options, development of design concepts, andproduction of an investigation report, including a discussion of options withrecommendations and cost estimates.</p>
<p>2. Development of the design documents for the selected option - including designanalysis, specifications, drawings and cost estimates.</p>
<p>3. Attendance at the various project related meetings and review conferences.</p>
<p>4. Responding to review comments and making revisions to the design as agreed uponduring the reviews.</p>
<p>5. Producing and submitting the final project design documents.</p>
<p>A-E EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS: A-E's experience shall include that which is commensurate with the requirements specific to the scope of design.</p>
<p>A. The ideal firm should have experience designing industrial control systems and upgrades to such systems, especially in operating industrial plants and in hot, dirty and hazardous environments, specifically Class II, Div1 and 2, Group F; experience in surveying existing facilities for hazardous materials, and design including remediation of such hazards as necessary to complete the other work of the project.</p>
<p>B. The A-E shall demonstrate that they have experienced personnel with Alaska Registrations, and adequate capacity and depth in the following disciplines:</p>
<p>1. Electrical Engineering</p>
<p>C. The A-E shall demonstrate that they have experienced personnel with certification, and adequate capacity and depth in the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Hazardous materials surveying, and preparing abatement and worker protection specifications.<br />2. Cost Estimating<br />3. Project Management</p>
<p>The Air Force requires complete and functional designs that are appropriate for the sub-arctic environment for interior Alaska and that meet all applicable Federal, State, Local, Industry, U.S. Air Force and Eielson AFB requirements.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>This is an UNRESTRICED Solicitation. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation seeking Firm Fixed Price (FFP) quotes for commercial aircraft component repair/overhaul services prepared in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. In the alternative, Test, Teardown, and Evaluation (TT&amp;E) with estimated (AVERAGE) repair/overhaul cost quotes may be submitted for consideration. When in receipt of evaluation (TT&amp;E) or baseline price quotes only, the government reserves the right to issue a purchase order based on the government's historical pricing data for the average or commercial catalog repair. Solicitation number 70Z03818QW0000046 is issued as a notice of intent to award to a capable repair vendor. It is anticipated that a competitive Purchase Order shall be awarded as a result of this notice. It is the Governments belief, that only a previously established Capable Repair Vendor in possession of the required OEM Data has the required proprietary technical and engineering data to successfully provide these repair services. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these services are invited to submit complete information discussing the same within (3) calendar days from this notice posting. The information submitted must include a letter from the OEM verifying the Offeror is an authorized service distributor and verifying the OEM will supply only genuine OEM parts. Instructions to Offerors-Commercial and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-96.
<p>Any vendor, except the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) or a Production Approval Holder (PAH), repairing Coast Guard Aircraft Components MUST be FAA 145 certified and perform at least fifty percent (50%) of the work at their company's FAA certified facility. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, awards for the repair or overhaul of Coast Guard Aircraft Repairable Components shall only be awarded directly to service vendors who have been deemed fully capable of performing such services by division level command-appointed Coast Guard Engineers or Equipment Specialists. Vendors who do not meet the above stated capability requirement will not be considered and should not respond to this solicitation/request for quote.</p>
<p>This solicitation will not be extended or the award delayed for a vendor to submit their service data for capability determination or for registration in SAM.GOV.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to recently submitted question from interested offerors and revise CLINs 0016, 1016, 2016, 3016 and 4016 for One (1) Lot of Parts. Solicitation Closing Date is January 05, 2018 at 5:00 pm EST!

What is the VA s definition of grand total on page 91? Confusion is that 0001 and (0001 AA, 0001 AB & 0001 AC) are duplicative. Therefore to reach actual grand total, contract award, should we only add 0001 + 0002 + 0003 .etc. and not the AA, AB & AC? The grand total amount on page 91 should reflect the total value of the contract duration, base period plus four (4) option periods.


Please confirm that since 2 Semi Annual inspections are required that the other  Semi Annual  is included in the Annual CLIN. Semi Annual Inspection and One Annual Inspection are required.


Do we include NY Sales tax in our bid or, can we obtain a tax exempt certificate from the VA upon contract award?  Please see attached.

approved Department of Labor (DoL) insurance carrier and submitted by the
offeror after award for reimbursement. In the event premiums are recalculated by
the approved DoL insurance carrier based on actual payrolls, the contracting
officer will adjust the DBA cost CLIN amount to reflect the actual premium
amount paid. The U.S. Government will NOT reimburse the contractor for DBA

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<BR><BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.
(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.
(2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the closing date and answer questions.
1. The closing date is extended 5 additional days. Closing will be 01/10/18 @ 1pm MST.
2. Questions:
Is there a brand and model number? Aladdin Temp-Right #MD16SLP8B4P45. But I stress that this model and brand are not mandatory.
we could do a single compartment cart with 2 trays per ledge and fit 12 trays. I am assuming 2 trays per ledge is ok since they want pass thru doors. Yes, 6 trays per side is acceptable/expected
My biggest concern in reading these specs is related to the tow hitch. Are they going to be purchasing our tug or are they using a piece of equipment they already have? We would need to know specs on the hitch as well as the piece of equipment is connecting to.
We use our electronic mule to tow these carts. The best we can do with the specs at the moment is this: 
Two   thick bars protrude from back of mule which are 3  wide with   diameter hole at the end of each bar. The lower bar is 8.5  off the ground. Upper bar is 11.5  off the ground with 2  space in between bars. Our current hitch system uses a metal pin which inserts into the 1/4  holes. The tow hitch needs to be retractable underneath the cart.
One last question for clarification, what do they mean by 8  balloon casters? We typically use 6  casters on our tray delivery carts and a 12 tray cart is not that heavy 8  casters seem excessive. Is there some specific reason or concern they are requesting these?"
For how far we drive our carts, the 8  casters limit the vibration to the meal cart/food trays better than the 6 . We occasionally drive on roads, but also drive in tunnels which have occasional metal transition pieces.

<p>The Government does not own the data or the rights to the data needed to manufacture this item. Firms interested in participating in this procurement are encouraged to contact the OEM, Hamilton-Sundstrand CAGE 73030 to inquire about the data or rights to the data.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>Foreign owned firms are advised to contact the contracting officer or program manager before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are restrictions on receiving an award.</p>
<p>It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contract with the firms(s) listed.</p>
<p>This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer</p>
<p>Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8253. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.<br />Request for written quotation will be issued. Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice.</p>
<p>20. Buyer name, phone#, and email address Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer Christopher J. Cook, 405-739-4478, christopher.cook.62@us.af.mil</p>

<p>PROGRAM BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The baseline STINGER M934E6 Fuze is a complex electromechanical assembly integrating hybrid microelectronics, advanced inertial and centrifugal components and electro-explosive devices into a single fuze package. The M934E6 Fuze must interface with the Warhead Body Assembly which forms one of the main structural supports to the missile airframe and consists of a machined Titanium body configured with a Hard Target Sensor (HTS), Radio- Frequency Interference (RFI) Filter and an electrical cable assembly that interfaces between the fuze/warhead and missile sections.</p>
<p>The STINGER M934E7 Proximity Fuzes and Warhead Body Assemblies with Antenna are complex electromechanical assemblies integrated with a Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) proximity sensor and conformal antenna into the existing baseline STINGER M934E6 Fuze and Warhead Body Assembly configuration. The direct replacement of shelf-life expired legacy configuration fuzes and warhead body assemblies with new Proximity configuration fuzes and warhead body assemblies (with antenna) will enhance the missile capability to engage Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) with a Proximity Detonation mode while maintaining the legacy fuzing detonation functions. The STINGER Proximity Fuze and Warhead Body Assembly with Antenna will provide a near miss capability against UAS targets while maintaining all legacy fuze functions against standard STINGER targets. The procurement of the legacy configuration STINGER M934E6 Fuze and Warhead Body Assembly will be in direct support of active and potential Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case requirements.</p>
<p>The STINGER M934E7 Fuze and Warhead Body Assembly with conformal antenna must interface with the M258E7 Warhead Section and missile guidance section and flight motor.

This will be a follow-on requirement to a previous National Immunization Survey Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) single award contract. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be cost plus fixed fee and firm fixed price types. The period of performance of sixty (60) months is anticipated. The applicable NAICS code is 541910. The RFP will be posted on FedBizOpps and is expected to be released on or about May 15, 2017. Interested parties are responsible for checking the website regularly for release of the RFP and for other procurement-related documents. TELEPHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. The information provided in this pre-solicitation is for information purposes only. If there are any differences in the information provided here and the actual solicitation when released, the information provided in the actual solicitation shall govern.
<p>Background and Need <br />The National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Immunization Services Division (ISD), a center of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), require the planning and conduct of the National Immunization Survey (NIS) and related tasks.<br />Vaccination for childhood diseases has proven to be one of the most effective public health measures available. This has been shown through the reduction in the incidence of vaccine preventable diseases throughout the United States. The adoption of laws for vaccinations as a requirement for school entry has been credited with high vaccination levels in this population. The 1989-1990 measles outbreak in the United States brought into focus the public health problem of under-vaccination among preschool children. Healthy People 2020 objectives for immunization and infectious diseases include reaching high proportions of children receiving recommended vaccinations by their second birthday and adolescents receiving additional recommended vaccinations by 13-15 years of age.</p>
<p>In 1992, the 50 States and 28 local areas were awarded grants to improve the vaccination levels of children by their second birthday, and improve related service delivery, information and education, and assessment activities. Each grantee area developed an Immunization Action Plan (IAP) for the use of these funds and proposed approaches to improve the immunization delivery system in their areas (referred to as IAP areas). Determination of vaccination levels and changes over time was necessary for monitoring the success of the grants to these IAP areas.</p>
<p>The NIS was established in response to the immediate and continuing need for quality and timely data pertaining to the vaccination coverage of pre-school children across the United States. Beginning in 1994, in addition to national vaccination coverage data collected via the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the NCHS and the National Immunization Program (NIP), which is now NCIRD, began collecting vaccination information for children 19-35 months in these 78, non-overlapping geographic IAP areas across the United States via the NIS, based on a random-digit-dial (RDD) landline telephone sample of households with immunization provider record check verification. This information has been used to monitor the need for vaccinations among 19-35 month old children in each IAP area and nationally in the civilian noninstitutionalized population.</p>
<p>During 2005 and 2006, some of the non-grantee IAP areas were rotated off the survey (no longer oversampled) to allow new selected sub-state areas to be oversampled. Starting with 2007 data collection, the 22 IAP areas that did not receive direct Section 317 immunization grant funding from CDC were no longer automatically oversampled. Starting in 2007, state immunization programs were offered the opportunity to direct grant funds to oversample sub-state areas of their choice. This change resulted in core NIS data collection in 56 non-overlapping, geographically defined Local Sampling Areas (LSAs), including the 50 states and six urban areas that receive Section 317 immunization grant funding directly from CDC (District of Columbia; City of Chicago, IL; City of New York, NY; Philadelphia County, PA; Bexar County, TX; and City of Houston, TX). Additional sub-state areas and U.S.-affiliated jurisdictions may be added and may vary from year to year.</p>
<p>By 2006, three new vaccines had been licensed and recommended for routine use in adolescents: meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4), tetanus, diphtheria, acelluar pertussis (Tdap), and (for girls) quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4). In the 4th quarters of 2006 and 2007, the NIS-Teen was conducted using the NIS sampling frame and methods to estimate vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13-17 years. In 2008, the NIS-Teen sample was expanded to provide estimates for the 56 core NIS LSA's, and starting in 2009 additional sub-state areas were added at the request of some states. It is possible that CDC may need to change the age range of children included in the NIS in the future.<br />The NIS has periodically added topical modules to the household interview to collect additional vaccine-related information as needed by CDC. A health insurance module to determine status of eligibility for the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC) was added in 2003 and became part of the core NIS survey in 2006. Recent modules have included expanded questions related to socioeconomic status and parental hesitancy to vaccinate their children. Surveys of adult vaccination were conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2007. During October 2009-June 2010, questions were asked of children of all ages identified during NIS screening to monitor seasonal and monovalent 2009 (H1N1) influenza vaccinations. These data were combined with a stand-alone dual frame landline and cell phone RDD influenza vaccination survey to comprise the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS). For subsequent influenza seasons, this data collection, called NIS-Flu, has continued each October through June for children aged 6 months through 17 years. Collectively, the data collected from the same sample frame consisting of children 19-35 months (NIS core), 13-17 years (NIS-Teen), and 6 months - 17 years (NIS-Flu) is described as the NIS Family of Surveys.<br />Research to improve the validity of survey estimates and effectiveness and efficiency of survey operations has been integral to the NIS since its inception. In recent years, declining willingness of the public to participate in surveys and changes in households' use of the telephone has resulted in declining response rates in the NIS and other surveys. Of particular concern is the increasing prevalence of households that have substituted their landline telephone for wireless service only. Over 40% of children aged 19-35 months may not be reachable by a landline survey. Addition of a cellular telephone sampling frame was piloted in 2010 and incorporated into the NIS starting in 2011 <br />(http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/nis/child/dual-frame-sampling.html). <br />Other research has investigated the potential role of Immunization Information Systems (IIS) in the conduct of the NIS. IIS are confidential, population-based, computerized databases that record all immunization doses administered by participating providers to persons residing within a given geopolitical area. At the point of clinical care, an IIS can provide consolidated immunization histories for use by a vaccination provider in determining appropriate client vaccinations. At the population level, an IIS provides aggregate data on vaccinations for use in surveillance and program operations, and in guiding public health action with the goals of improving vaccination rates and reducing vaccine-preventable disease. IIS exist in most states, but vary in their level of child and provider participation, completeness of vaccination histories, and completeness and accuracy of household contact information. With continued development of IIS and increased use of electronic medical record systems and their integration into IIS, they may eventually replace the role of NIS in providing timely, valid and comparable estimates of vaccination coverage across state and local areas. In the shorter term, NIS and NIS-Teen samples have been matched to selected IIS to compare vaccination histories reported by both, and the potential use of IIS as a sampling frame, as a supplement to or in place of a telephone sample, has also been evaluated. Substantial efficiencies could be gained using IISs to supplement or replace the current NIS RDD telephone sampling frame. Further work is needed to define when an IIS is ready to be used as a sample frame, identify legal and policy barriers to data sharing, and assess willingness and resources needed by states to participate. The potential role of IIS to improve the efficiency of the NIS provider record check has also been evaluated.<br />Project Objective <br />The NIS contract will obtain a contractor to conduct the NIS and other related research tasks through the issuance of individual task orders. The objective of the NIS is to produce annual estimates of the proportion of noninstitutionalized children 19 through 35 months and 13 through 17 years receiving vaccinations recommended by the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), in each of the nonoverlapping LSAs. It is also intended to describe sociodemographic disparities in vaccination coverage, factors that influence the vaccination status of children, the uptake of newly recommended vaccines, and how information about immunization is understood by the public. The objective for other related research is to: assess influenza vaccination utilization and related information during annual influenza seasons; assess additional vaccination-related information from children or adults of any age in response to emerging program needs; and improve efficiency, quality and validity of NIS.<br />Scope of Work <br />Project objectives will be achieved through issuance of firm fixed price or cost plus fixed fee task orders to conduct survey activities that are organized into the following subject areas:</p>
<p>a. NIS Core. Collection of vaccination data for children aged 19-35 months in each of at least 56 state and local areas of the United States.</p>
<p>b. NIS-Teen. Collection of vaccination data for adolescents aged 13-17 years using the same sample as the NIS, in each of at least 56 state and local areas of the United States.</p>
<p>c. Influenza Vaccination Surveys (children 6 months to 7 years). Collection of data related to influenza vaccination among persons of all ages.</p>
<p>d. Optional Vaccination-related Modules. Collection of additional vaccination-related data for children eligible for the NIS or NIS-Teen, NIS-Flu or from other age groups of children or adults, using the same sample as the NIS, or using separate, stand-alone sampling frames.</p>
<p>e. Operational Methods Research. Evaluation, research and experiments to improve efficiency, quality and validity of NIS. <br />Period of Performance <br />The period of performance for issuance of task orders against the IDIQ contract is a base period of one year and four one-year option periods. Individual periods of performance will be specified per each task order. <br />Technical Requirements <br />Task orders will be issued by NCIRD under the following general categories:</p>
<p>a. NIS Core. Collection of vaccination data for children aged 19-35 months in each of at least 56 state and local areas of the United States.</p>
<p>The NIS Core Task Orders will involve: 1) the design and conduct of quarterly/annual surveys to be fielded in each of the LSAs collecting data from the families of age-eligible children in RDD interviews for specified data years; 2) collecting data from the medical providers reported for those children (with oral consent from the parent or guardian); 3) combining the information from the responding providers and families to produce improved vaccination estimates comparable over time; 4) other data collections; 5) performing descriptive analyses of the data collected; 6) preparing computer files from edited survey data and reports documenting the files and the survey data collection methods and process results, and 7) performance monitoring and quality improvement efforts to assess and improve data quality and survey efficiency.</p>
<p>A NIS data year refers to one calendar year, January 1 - December 31, during which quarterly samples of landline and cellular telephone numbers are dialed to identify households with age-eligible children and conduct NIS interviews. Associated with each data year are approximately three prior months for planning (October - December), 12 months for household data collection, and approximately nine subsequent months to complete household interviews, complete follow-up of medical providers, prepare and deliver restricted access and public use data files, and final reports. For example, NIS data year 2018 includes activities that would span from approximately October 2017 through December 2019. NIS data year 2019 would span from approximately October 2018 through December 2020. Thus, activities associated with separate Task Orders for consecutive NIS data years would overlap in their period of performance.</p>
<p>b. NIS-Teen. Collection of vaccination data for adolescents aged 13-17 years using the same sample as the NIS, in each of at least 56 state and local areas of the United States. Survey procedures are generally similar to those required to conduct the core NIS.</p>
<p>c. Influenza Vaccination Surveys (children 6 months to 7 years). Collection of data related to influenza vaccination among persons of all ages.</p>
<p>Task orders in this category may include influenza modules asked of children of any age identified during NIS screening, and general population surveys using an independent sample conducted continuously or periodically during the vaccination period, typically during October through June. CDC may use this contract for annual monitoring of influenza vaccination, with expanded approaches implemented as needed in emergent situations (e.g., pandemic influenza, shortage of influenza vaccine).</p>
<p>d. Optional Vaccination-related Modules. Collection of additional vaccination-related data for children eligible for the NIS or NIS-Teen, or NIS-Flu from other age groups of children or adults, using the same sample as the NIS, or using separate, stand-alone sampling frames.</p>
<p>Short (e.g., approximately 5 minutes) survey modules may be added to the end of the NIS, NIS-Teen, or NIS-Flu survey to collect additional vaccination related information (e.g., parental attitudes toward childhood vaccination). Task orders in this category may also include vaccination-related surveys using the NIS sampling frame, or separate, standalone sampling frames, to obtain parental information regarding vaccination of children of any age, or to obtain information from persons &ge;18 years about their own vaccination-related behavior.</p>
<p>e. Research Tasks. Evaluation, research and experiments to improve efficiency, quality and validity of NIS.</p>
<p>Task orders in this category may include experiments to test modifications of survey instruments, survey operations and procedures, designing more efficient or valid sample designs (e.g., improved telephone sample design, switch to an address-based sample frame, or incorporating IIS as a NIS sample frame), and matching of NIS and NIS-Teen samples with IIS to evaluate completeness of IIS and NIS vaccination data. To the extent possible, changes in NIS design, methods, and operations are tested and evaluated before and after implementation, to ensure continuity in validity of estimates over time.</p>
<p>In general, the contractor's responsibilities include such activities as:<br />&bull; Questionnaire design and testing;<br />&bull; Survey instrument modification if necessary and approved by CDC;<br />&bull; Sampling plan, design, and selection;<br />&bull; Preparation of the survey questionnaire(s) and other necessary data collection materials;<br />&bull; Recruitment, training and performance monitoring of interviewers;<br />&bull; Administration of telephone, mail surveys, and web surveys for providers;<br />&bull; Development of weighting procedures and implementation of estimators;<br />&bull; Design and implementation of quality control procedures;<br />&bull; Conversion of data on paper forms into machine readable form;<br />&bull; Preparation of field and methodological reports;<br />&bull; Preparation of verified, edited, and documented data files (on tape or other electronic format acceptable to the Contracting Officer's Representative {COR});<br />&bull; Preparation of materials for submission to the ERB;<br />&bull; Methodological Studies; and<br />&bull; Other activities essential for the successful completion of the project.</p>
<p>Place of Performance <br />Services will be performed at vendor specified site in the United States. All aspects of work related to this contract must be performed in the U. S., this includes work performed by the Contractor and any sub-contractors. For individual task orders, some work may be conducted in the U.S.-affiliated jurisdictions (e.g., United States Virgin Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico) at the specific request of the COR.<br />Reporting Schedule <br />Contractor reporting requirements will be defined in each individual task order.

<DESC>DLA Energy, in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the Electric (NAICS 221122), Water (NAICS 221310), and Wastewater (NAICS 221320) utility systems at U.S. Army Garrison Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico.
<p>Utilities Privatization (UP) is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity, for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility systems replacements. The conveyance may consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system. UP will be accomplished in accordance with 10 U.S.C. &sect;2688 - Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority.</p>
<p>As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the Electric, Water, and Wastewater utility systems. The new owner shall operate and maintain the systems and provide utility services to the Government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, maintenance costs, major system renovations, construction, equipment, manpower, and overhead costs shall become the utility system owner's responsibility. <br /><br />The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain, and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.</p>
<p>Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right to Access or an Easement as a reference to the resultant contract. The utility systems will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. Past performance information from potential offerors shall be submitted as directed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>A Sources Sought Notice for this requirement was previously publicized under solicitation number SPE600-16-R-0811 on March 9, 2016. The Sources Sought Notice has closed and market research is complete. This requirement will be unrestricted. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit an offer.<br /><br />Other-than-small businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer. Interested sources may contact Anne Ditch at Anne.Ditch@dla.mil, Anna Muldowney at Anna.Muldowney @dla.mil or Taina Rivera at Taina.Rivera@dla.mil, to be added to our offeror mailing list.</p>
<p>A copy of the solicitation will be available on or after May 15, 2017, via the Federal Business Opportunity (FBO) system (https://www.fbo.gov).<br /><br /><strong>Secure Documents</strong></p>
<p>As this requirement will be an unrestricted, competitive action, several of the solicitation documents will be posted as "secured" on the Federal Business Opportunity ("FedBizOpps" or "FBO") website. In order to view those documents, vendors will need to obtain special access. The process of obtaining access is somewhat lengthy, therefore all interested vendors are encouraged to begin that process as soon as possible. Instructions for obtaining access are provided below. <br /><br /><em><strong>Instructions for access to the FBO Secure Site</strong></em></p>
<p>To access the secured, but unclassified, documents in the FBO system, vendors must follow these instructions:<br /><br />1. Register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ . For assistance with SAM, please contact the SAM help desk. Contact information is available at https://www.fsd.gov/.<br /><br />2. Once registered in SAM, go to the FBO website at https://www.fbo.gov/ and log in. Verify your SAM registration within the FBO system. For assistance with FBO, please consult the FBO Vendor Guide, which is available at https://www.fbo.gov/downloads/FBO_Vendor_Guide.pdf .<br /><br />3. After your SAM registration is verified in the FBO system, please follow the steps as outlined below:<br /><br />a) Begin by clicking on the secured document link, which should then provide you with the corresponding link for the DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement. The DD2345 is also available at: http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/forms/eforms/dd2345.pdf .<br /><br />b) Fill out the DD 2345 and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office, at the address listed on the form.<br /><br />c) The Joint Certification Office will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date.<br /><br />d) For assistance with the DD2345, or to inquire about the acceptability of electronic provision of documentation, please contact the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office. Contact information is available at https://public.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/PublicHome/jcp/# . DLA Energy is not involved in the approval process and cannot provide assistance with processing.<br /><br />e) Once approval is received, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.<br /><br />4. Once you receive the approved DD2345 from JCP, and have verified your status on the JCP website, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link. The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN. If you are not prompted to enter a MPIN, please contact the FBO help desk. Contact information can be found at https://www.fsd.gov/.<br /><br />a) The MPIN is a mandatory data element created by the SAM registrant which must have nine characters [consisting of at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number, with no spaces or special characters permitted]<br /><br />b) The MPIN allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also validates access to sensitive, but unclassified, documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.<br /><br />5. Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors must then submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button. Upon requesting explicit access in the FBO system, vendors should send an email notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, so that they can approve the request in the FBO system. Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy. Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR>In responding to this request for quote, you must provide the manufacturer's
name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on
Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the
following salient characteristics (insert salient characteristics). If your

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is seeking information through this Request for Information (RFI) to identify potential commercial domestic and international sources for a Payload Fairing (PLF) to be used on the Space Launch System (SLS). This RFI focuses on identifying the cost efficiencies of advancements made in the last 5 years regarding new fairing material options, large diameter manufacturing techniques, and related analytical and testing capabilities. Responses to this RFI are intended for NASA to better understand associated PLF budget affordability and schedule timeliness to meet SLS lifecycle needs as well as general NASA programmatic, technical, design, construction, and workmanship approaches. NASA is interested in a first launch of the PLF as part of the SLS Program in the early 2020s with the potential of three additional flights later in the decade.
<p><br />SLS is the launch vehicle designed to send people and hardware beyond low earth orbit. The SLS is also an element of the overall Exploration Systems Development (ESD) architecture that includes launch vehicles, spacecraft, mission systems and ground systems, as well as future in-space and surface systems, needed to embark on a robust human solar system exploration program.</p>
<p>The information obtained will be used by NASA for planning and acquisition strategy development. NASA will use the information obtained as a result of this RFI on a non-attribution basis. Providing data/information that is limited or restricted for use by NASA for that purpose would be of very little value and such restricted/limited data/information is not solicited. No information or questions received will be posted to any website or public access location. NASA does not plan to respond to the individual responses. This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only and the Government does not presently intend to award a contract at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is subject to FAR 52.215-3, Request for Information of Solicitation for Planning Purposes. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of responses to this RFI. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Any responses to this RFI that contain export controlled information should be properly marked as such.</p>
<p>NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this RFI can be found at https://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this RFI, an Engineering Cost Estimate (ECE) is defined as an estimate with line item breakout and rates that provides a financial estimate by fiscal year, to be reported in FY18 dollars. All diagrams are notional mission concepts and subject to change.</p>
<p>In addition to whatever information the responder chooses to provide, each RFI response shall include a cover sheet with the following information:</p>
<p>&#61607; RFI Number and Title<br />&#61607; Responding Organization (including address, POC and phone number)<br />&#61607; A brief synopsis of the RFI response in less than 20 words<br />&#61607; Potential partnerships (industry, international, US Government agencies)</p>
<p>On October 1, 2017, the Small Business Administration (SBA) replaced its "Table of Small Business Size Standards" within the Federal Procurement Data System - Next Generation (FPDS-NG) to reflect the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 2017 revisions. Please self-certify to ensure that the responder is in compliance with the appropriate NAICS 2017 codes. The SBA's "Table of Small Business Size Standards" can be found at https://www.sba.gov/contracting/getting-started-contractor/make-sure-you-meet-sba-size-standards/table-small-business-size-standards.</p>
<p>The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI. The information provided in responses to this RFI will not be made public. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Responses to this RFI will not be returned, and respondents will not be notified of the result of any assessment. Although we will not provide feedback on your responses, information provided may be considered by NASA in formulating its acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>Upon receiving and reviewing responses to this RFI, NASA may choose to post a subsequent revision to this RFI to request further information from industry to support NASA's acquisition planning for the contemplated procurement.</p>
<p>All responses, including capability statement, should not exceed 30 pages and be provided in MS Word document format via email and include the Reference Number: NNM18ZXP004L. Font should be Times New Roman, size 12. Please submit responses no later than January 26, 2018 to NASA/MSFC Office of Procurement via e-mail to Brian.F.Faraci@nasa.gov and cc: Kellie Craig at Kellie.D.Craig@nasa.gov.</p>
<p>No solicitation for this requirement currently exists. However, if an amendment to this RFI or solicitation is released, it will by synopsized on FedBizOpps. It is the potential Offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any amendments to this RFI or if released, future solicitation documents related to this synopsis. Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of this RFI, or if released, any future solicitation documents.</p>

<DESC>Amendment One:&nbsp; This solicitation is being amended to change the delivery information in the body of the solicitation to match the delivery information within the statement of work.&nbsp; The deliver and installation of the 1000L Ar &nbsp;tank shall be within 45 days of contract award.&nbsp; <br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 - Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a separate written solicitation document will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued under the authority of FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. <br /><br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotations (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-95 effective 1/19/2017.<br />The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 325120 with a small business size standard of 1,000 Employees. This acquisition is being procured as a Total Small Business Set Aside. Only quotes submitted by qualified small business concerns will be considered.<br /><br />Delivery<br />The 1000L microbulk Ar tank shall be delivered, installed and filled no later than 45days after the date of award. The items shall be shipped F.O.B. Destination to: <br />NIST Charleston Laboratory<br />Hollings Marine Laboratory<br />331 Ft. Johnson Rd. <br />Charleston, SC 29412<br /><br />FOB DESTINATION MEANS: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.<br /><br />EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD<br />The Government intends to award a purchase order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Contractor whose quotation, conforming to the solicitation, is the lowest price, technically acceptable quotation.<br />Technically acceptable means that the Contractor provides a microbulk Ar tank and Argon that meets the requirements specified in the Statement of Work, and the requirements of all Line Items and option years. If a Contractor does not indicate how its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not. A top and bottom fill piping circuit is required to maintain gas line pressure and eliminate the need to install and use backup high pressure argon cylinders during liquid fill events. Contractors that propose to provide any tank solution that requires the use of backup, high pressure argon cylinders to avoid the requirement to provide a new tank equipped with a top and bottom fill piping circuit will be rejected as unacceptable. <br /><br />Price will be evaluated to determine that total price is consistent with the technical portion of the quotation and is a fair and reasonable overall price to the Government.<br />NIST intends to evaluate quotes and issue a contract based on the initial quotes received. Therefore, the Contractor's initial quote should contain the Contractor's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. NIST reserves the right to request revised quotes from, or negotiate final contract terms with, one or more, but not all, Contractors if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.<br /><br />REQUIRED SUBMISSIONS<br />All Contractors shall submit the following:<br />1. For the purpose of evaluation of Technical Acceptability: Documentation that confirms the contractor is capable of providing the supplies specified in the statement of work.
<p>2. Contractors shall provide pricing for the following line items and option years.<br />Base Year: 8500 liquid liters, or 252535 scf gas<br />Line Item 1: Required Specifications for Liquid Argon:<br />Critical Assay-99.999%<br />Meets ICP-MS Specification<br />Oxygen-&lt; 2 ppm<br />Total Hydrocarbons (as CH4)-&lt; 0.5 ppm<br />Nitrogen-&lt; 10 ppm <br />Carbon Dioxide-&lt; 0.5 ppm<br />Water-&lt; 5 ppm<br />Carbon Monoxide-&lt; 0.5 ppm <br />Hydrogen-&lt; 2 ppm <br />Valve Material-Solid Brass and Stainless Steel are acceptable<br />Line Item 2: Delivery Requirements and Minimum Tank Levels.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall not let the microbulk tank deplete (become empty). To prevent depletion of the argon product, the tank shall be outfitted with a wireless telemetry system that communicates with the Contractor and notifies the Contractor that the tank needs to be filled. The Contractor shall provide and maintain a working telemetry system for the tank. If the telemetry system fails or is out of order, it shall be repaired or replaced by the Contractor as outlined in Section I. Gas delivery orders shall be called in by phone when repairs are delayed.<br />The following minimum levels shall be maintained at all times for the microbulk Tank: 20% of the total capacity.<br />Option Year I: 8500 liquid liters, or 252535 scf gas<br />Option Year II: 8500 liquid liters, or 252535 scf gas<br />Option Year III: 8500 liquid liters, or 252535 scf gas<br />Option Year IV: 8500 liquid liters, or 252535 scf gas<br />3. A completed version of all required solicitation provisions (see attached provisions/clauses document - required submissions highlighted in blue).</p>
<p><br />4. If the contractor objects to any of the terms and conditions contained in this solicitation, the contractor shall state "The terms and conditions in the solicitation are acceptable to be included in the award document with the exception, deletion, or addition of the following:" [Contractor shall list exception(s) and rationale for the exception(s)]. It is the sole responsibility of the contractor to identify in their quote any exceptions to the terms and conditions of the solicitation. If the contractor does not include such a statement, the submission of a quotation in response to this solicitation will be regarded as the Contractor's acceptance of the Government's terms and conditions for inclusion into the resultant purchase order.<br /><br />5. Contractors shall provide an active DUNS # for the System for Award Management (SAM) registration.<br /><br />6. If the Contractor's representations and certifications in SAM.gov do not reflect the NAICS code governing this solicitation, Contractors must submit documentation that they are a small business under the NAICS code governing this solicitation.<br />Please note that this procurement IS NOT being conducted under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program or another Government-Wide Area Contract (GWAC). If a contractor submits a quotation based upon an FSS or GWAC contract, the Government will accept the quoted price. However, the terms and conditions stated herein will be included in any resultant Purchase Order, not the terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS or GWAC contract, and the statement required above shall be included in the quotation;<br /><br />DUE DATE FOR QUOTATIONS<br />All quotations must be submitted via e-mail to Wendy Paulo, Contracting Officer at Wendy.Paulo@nist.gov.

<DESC><p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) <br />OPO-18-RFI-000001-Passive Cooling Techniques and Systems</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY in accordance with FAR 15.201(e). This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP or Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). This RFI does not commit the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) to contract for any supply or service. DHS S&amp;T is not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the S&amp;T will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or BAA. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the S&amp;T. All submissions become the property of S&amp;T, and will not be returned.</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND/PROGRAM DESCRIPTION<br />DHS S&amp;T is seeking information on developed passive cooling techniques and systems capable of stabilizing temperatures in unmanned facilities, and is issuing this RFI to determine availability, capability, and maturity of these systems.</p>
<p>2. PROBLEM STATEMENT/REQUIREMENTS <br />Passive Cooling Definition. DHS S&amp;T defines passive cooling as an approach that stabilizes interior temperature of a building through heat gain control and heat dissipation with low or no energy consumption. DHS S&amp;T will test and evaluate facility prototype's capability to provide passive cooling to continuously stabilize temperature of electronic equipment at or below 100oF during day / night cycle.</p>
<p>Notional Facility Characteristics. The facility will: a) be unmanned, but remotely monitored; b) be 10' x 10' x 10' in length, width and height; c) be sited in austere, geographically-remote desert areas; d) be in an environment where the hottest days reach ~120oF and drop to 86oF at night. [During hot season, average daily temperature difference between day and night was 25oF]; and e) house electronic equipment that is expected to generate roughly 10.0 kilowatt-hours of heat 24-hours-a-day.</p>
<p>General Characteristics. DHS S&amp;T requests you provide information on your technique and/or systems general capabilities and attributes, and your company information, guided by the following questions, and include any known or expected issues and limitations. The following questions pertain to your passive cooling technique and/or system for a building.<br />&bull; Approach. What is your approach for heat gain control and heat dissipation? For example, what modalities does your approach use, i.e. conduction, convection, radiation, or a mixture?<br />&bull; Environment Pre-Requisites. Is your approach optimized for facility cooling applications for remote, arid, desert conditions? Is water availability (limited or unlimited) required for your system to work? <br />&bull; Weather Volatility Effects. Does wind, rain, fog, or cloud cover degrade the effectiveness of your approach?<br />&bull; Materials. What materials are required by your approach? Do materials require special fabrication, long lead-time, or are they Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS)? For example, does your approach use special materials, e.g. graphene with high thermal conductivity and high emissivity, or anhydrous ammonia heat pipes?<br />&bull; Above/Below Ground Facility. Is the system buried or above ground? If buried, what is a typical depth and how do soil or freeze/thaw cycle and other conditions affect the system? Are there any other specific burial requirements for the system? <br />&bull; Special Skills or Licenses. What techniques, skills, or licenses/permits are required to implement your approach? For example: a) design and construction will involve masonry, brick-laying, concrete formwork, crane operation, digging or drilling, geo-thermal engineering, heating-ventilation and air conditioning, mechanical engineering; or b) advanced science will involve nanotechnology fabrication or top-down plasma etching?<br />&bull; Temperature Monitoring. Will your system operate without monitoring? Can the user monitor and control the temperature conditions of your cooling system in-place or remotely?<br />&bull; Test Results. Do you have any internal or independent test results? <br />&bull; System Specifications/Drawings. What is the format for blueprints or material fabrication standards that will be used to make the system?<br />&bull; Company History. Is this an existing technology or only a technology concept? If it is an existing technology, how long has your company's product been on the market?<br />&bull; Market Stability. Have there been sales or installations of your system? To whom? Where? <br />&bull; Intellectual Property. Are there any company patents or Intellectual Property restrictions regarding the system?</p>
<p>Detailed Characteristics. The Notional Facility Characteristics described above should serve as a reference for answering following questions.<br />&bull; Approach Efficiency. How much more energy efficient is your approach than using a typical window air conditioner to cool interior temperature of a 1,000 cubic foot building in kilowatt-hours per day?<br />&bull; Scale. Could your system be reduced in scale to a smaller sized building than notional facility described above to house electronic equipment?<br />&bull; Maintainability. What is the Mean Time Before Failure (MTBF) and Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) for your system?<br />&bull; Estimated Cost. How much will your system cost for the notional facility described above.</p>
<p><br />3. RESPONDING TO THIS RFI<br />Sources able to address the above request are invited to submit information describing their technology. <br />Please limit White Paper submissions to a maximum of 10 pages (including a cover sheet) and provide the following information:</p>
<p>Cover Page (Page 1)<br />&bull; Contact and company information<br />o Name<br />o Title<br />o Company name<br />o Date of incorporation<br />o Number of years in business<br />o Number of employees<br />o Location<br />o Mailing address<br />o Phone number<br />o Website address<br />o Email address<br />o Note that RFI respondents shall designate a single point of contact for receipt of all information pursuant to this RFI.<br />&bull; Name/type of technology or model<br />&bull; Technology maturity: Existing technology or technology concept<br />&bull; Brief overview of company history</p>
<p>Body of White Paper (Pages 2-10); the submittal should address the requests for information above, and any additional technical or company information. A description of the system supported by technical parameters is desired.</p>
<p>White Papers should be submitted in the following font: Times New Roman/Size = 12.</p>
<p>Supporting documentation (such as marketing brochures, fliers, published presentations or papers and other materials that summarize the technology and more about your company) is acceptable (up to 7 pages worth), and may be referenced by reviewers only in support of claims identified in the White Paper, and only where specifically referenced in the White Paper. The Government makes no guarantee that the supporting documentation will be reviewed and/or considered.</p>
<p>Responses to this request for information are to be submitted electronically to Office of Procurement Operations, Science &amp; Technology Division, DHS at S&amp;TPassiveCoolingRFI@hq.dhs.gov.</p>
<p>&middot; Please include the RFI number (OPO-18-RFI-000001-Passive Cooling Techniques and Systems) in the subject line of your email.<br />&middot; Method of Submission: One electronic submission in machine-readable format (typically PDF, ASCII, MS Word, or WordPerfect format).</p>
<p>Submissions must be received no later than 3:00 PM, U.S. Eastern Standard Time, Wednesday, January 10, 2018. DHS reserves the right to review late submissions but makes no guarantee to the order of, or possibility for, review of late submissions.</p>
<p>Any company proprietary information, performance capabilities and/or future modification plans should be clearly identified and marked.</p>
<p>Respondents are solely responsible for any and all expenses incurred pursuant to responding to this RFI.</p>
<p>Responses to the RFI will not be returned.</p>
<p>Responses to the RFI may be used to develop Government documentation.</p>
<p>Unsolicited proposals in response to this RFI will not be considered.</p>
<p><br />4. GOVERNMENT PLANS<br />This RFI is issued solely for market research, planning and information purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a subsequent solicitation (Broad Agency Announcement, Request for Proposal, etc.). While the Government, after a detailed review and thorough analysis of the RFI submissions, expects to issue a solicitation for additional characterization of several of these devices, it has not committed itself to doing so.</p>
<p>In the event a solicitation is issued, the Government expects that the timing is likely to be in early Calendar Year 2018.</p>
<p><br />5. CLASSIFIED SUBMISSION<br />Classified submissions are not being accepted for the RFI. The eventual solicitation, if any/issued, will have provisions to support classified submissions.</p>
<p>Please limit your White Paper responses to this RFI to SSI, company proprietary or unrestricted information, and please mark submissions appropriately. SSI submissions can be submitted as normal by password protecting the document, and then sending the password separately to the contract specialist.</p>
<p>The following is an abbreviated description of SSI:</p>
<p>"SSI is a control designation used by the Department of Homeland Security, and particularly the Transportation Security Administration. It is applied to information about security programs, vulnerability and threat assessments, screening processes, technical specifications of certain screening equipment and objects used to test screening equipment, and equipment used for communicating security information relating to air, land, or maritime transportation.

The activity will focus its support for service delivery in six intervention areas: family planning, malaria, routine immunization, nutrition, maternal/newborn health, and treatment of childhood pneumonia/diarrhea.&nbsp; This program will also work closely with State-level government officials to support established State-level Health and Development Plans, build capacity, and promote ownership of interventions, systems, and results. This program will contribute to State-level reductions in under-five mortality and maternal mortality, and increase the capacity of health systems (public and/or private) to sustainably support quality primary health care services.</span></p>
