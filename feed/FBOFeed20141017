<p>FEDERAL AGENCY NAME: Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AFRL - Rome Research Site, AFRL/Information Directorate, 26 Electronic Parkway, Rome, NY, 13441-4514</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) TITLE: Space Operations Initiative (SOI)</p>
<p>BAA ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial announcement</p>
<p>BAA NUMBER: BAA RIK-2015-0001</p>
<p>CATALOG OF FEDERAL DOMESTIC ASSISTANCE (CFDA) Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION: The objective of the Space Operations Initiative (SOI) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to provide Space Operations Centers with the ability to efficiently and effectively command and control (C2) space forces and assess the effectiveness of space capabilities to achieve desired effects within the battle space. This BAA represents the space component of the Autonomy, Command and Control, and Decision Support Core Technical Competency (AC2 CTC) integrated C2 concept.</p>
<p>The scope of this BAA is to develop and demonstrate technologies which will enable Space Superiority. Space Superiority is defined in Joint Publication 3-14 (2013), Space Operations, as "the degree of dominance in space of one force over any others that permits the conduct of its operations at a given time and place without prohibitive interference from space-based threats". This involves both defensive and offensive space control functions, as well as implementing the doctrine of C2 from Air Force Doctrine Document 2-8, Command and Control. Space C2 functions enable commanders to plan, direct, coordinate, synchronize and control operations of assigned forces.</p>
<p>2. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>Technologies are needed for improvement of Space Operations at the strategic, operational and tactical levels, in the following technology areas:</p>
<p>(1) Command and control (C2), <br />(2) Electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) visualization and <br />(3) Automated, real-time course of action (COA) generation</p>
<p>White papers are being sought that provide enhanced event monitoring and task execution, situational assessment, automated decision aids for better course of action analysis and selection, dynamic resource management, and agile C2 enterprise management with the goal of allowing more adaptable, real-time, resilient operations in support of the three technology areas above. Technologies must be compatible with the Joint Space Operation Center (JSpOc) Mission Systems (JMS) Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and clearly demonstrate Measures of Performance (MOP) and Measures of Effectiveness (MOE) of the end product.</p>
<p>Developing innovative technologies necessary to enhance the planning, scheduling and assessing of space C2 capabilities and the ability to provide a seamless path to integrate across the air, space, and cyber domains to achieve desired global effects are desired. Of principal concern are the discovery, development, and generation of near real-time COAs which may be utilized to rapidly adapt to, or avoid, changes to the unique military space operational environment. In addition, planning for continuing and future space operations in an ever-evolving electromagnetic environment are also of concern, specifically the ability to command and control space forces based on the current and expected future status of the EMS. <br /><br /><strong>NOTE: While this BAA is seeking white papers in all three technology areas listed above and offerors may respond to one or more at any time, the initial solicitation due 17 Nov 2014 is for white papers focusing on technical approaches for Automated, Real-Time COA Generation. </strong></p>
<p>AUTOMATED, REAL-TIME COA GENERATION: This focus area is soliciting innovative approaches to develop a SOA compliant capability for space C2 COA planning and evaluation for use in near real-time real world operations, exercises, and training situations. End-to-end systems to enable this capability as well as standalone components will be considered. The ability to continuously analyze the current state of the relevant electromagnetic spectrum and the effect on the C2 of space forces is desired. The system capability should aid the operator in determining the feasibility of the COA in achieving the commander's intent. The key capability is to enable the planner to apportion low density, high demand resources to meet global needs. Novel approaches and the use of Modeling and Simulation are encouraged that will allow operators to easily interact with the capability and develop credible results while managing uncertainty. Any developed framework will be used to assess, predict and react to changes in a situation by predicting possible futures and recommending optimal options. A ranked, composite score will be provided to assist human planners in deciding which COAs to recommend to the commander. Key metrics are number of credible results, fidelity of analysis, agility to handle different scenarios, use of templates/knowledge bases to speed planning process, and understandable results clearly showing risk/benefits of each COA developed and analyzed. Ability to efficiently include applicable government generated techniques, products, or knowledge is highly desired.<br />II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. FUNDING: Total funding for this BAA is approximately $9.95M.

IMPORTANT: If you do not have a DCAA approved accounting system access the following link for instructions: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=1">https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1cffad228f48b58057072a6c9113799d&amp;tab=<br />core&amp;_cview=1</a></p>
<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).</p>
<p>No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated by Government employees at the Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate and Space and Missile Systems Center's Space Superiority Systems Directorate. AFRL/RI and SMC/SY have contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>3. ADEQUATE PRICE COMPETITION: The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>VI. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STEP TWO INFORMATION</span></strong> - REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL &amp; AWARD:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>

However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Prospective vendors must comply with all the requirements of the solicitation and its attachments to be considered responsive. The Government does not intend to hold discussion but may hold discussion if it is deemed necessary. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at 405-736-3273.

<p>Quantity: 1</p>
<p>Various Increments Solicited: 1 TO 1 AND 2 TO 2</p>
<p>Destination Information: FOB Origin, Inspection and Acceptance at Destination</p>
<p>Delivery Schedule: 350 days</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available in DIBBS on its issue date of 11/03/14 at <a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP/">https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Small Business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: unrestricted</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>

By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979.

However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>

<p><br />The Contractor serves as point of contact and provides support for the Write Your Own (WYO) program and NFIP Direct Servicing Agent (DSA). A Monthly Technical Progress Narrative (MTPN) created by the Contractor provides a comprehensive report of the previous month's activities and provides valuable information to FIMA management. In addition to the services listed above, the Contractor provides support operations for the WYO insurance companies and the DSA contractor. <br /><br />Additionally, the Contractor engages in support activities that include tracking collecting, disseminating, maintaining, and updating information on the NFIP and the WYOs.<br /><br />FEMA is responsible for administering the WYO program, which includes, but is not limited to setting operating policies, establishing rates, designating eligible communities, developing reporting requirements, and creating auditing specifications. There are approximately 5.6 million NFIP policies in force, with over $1.25 Trillion of coverage in force. These policies are sold and serviced through over 80 private insurance companies participating in the WYO program, all of whom must report every transaction to the NFIP. The <br />Contractor must reconcile the policy details and produce accurate reports to ensure the financial integrity of the program. This involves about $3.2 billion in annual premiums collections that must be accurately accounted for. FEMA undertakes these activities in cooperation with participating NFIP communities and the Insurance Industry.<br /><br />The WYO companies are the primary vehicle for selling, delivering, and servicing flood insurance policies, and they are responsible for approximately 75% of NFIP policies in force. The WYOs have been invaluable in the NFIP's effort to increase the flood insurance policy base, increase the geographic distribution of policyholders, improve service to policyholders as well as insurance agents, and enhance the NFIP's ability to settle claims promptly and fairly in post-catastrophe environments.<br /><br />The Contractor establishes catastrophe and coordination field offices in the event of large scale or severe flooding. These offices are set up to expedite claims and coordinate WYO activities. Also, through a central office and field offices, the Contractor conducts NFIP outreach to support FEMA's Regional Offices. <br /><br />The Government anticipates making a single award FFP contract with one base year and four one-year option periods. The solicitation is subject to full and open competition. All responsible offerors may submit a proposal when the solicitation is issued. Copies of the solicitation will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website. It is anticipated the solicitation will be available in November 2014. Interested parties are advised to regularly monitor FBO for updates to this procurement.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Materials Science and Engineering Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, for two (2) Flat Panel X-ray Digital Imaging Detectors (Model 0822).
<p><br />Sole Source determination is based on the following: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducts strain tensor measurements for the Innovations in Measurement Science project "Building Metrological Foundations for Nanomechanics." These measurements use the microbeam diffraction instrument that is located at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. NIST is a partner in the development and use of this instrument and leads the efforts in measuring strain tensors. These strain tensor measurements use three X-ray area detectors (one large and two small) for data acquisition. These detectors (manufactured by PerkinElmer) are integral components of the instrument. The two small detectors are failing and require replacement. Replacement detectors must be compatible with the existing instrument, thus avoiding a major redesign of the entire instrument and software control system. In addition, future software driver upgrades must be compatible with both the existing large detector and the small detectors that need to be acquired.</p>
<p>PerkinElmer, Inc., is the only vendor capable of providing the required Flat Panel X-ray Digital Imaging Detectors that meet the Government's minimum requirements and is 100% compatible with the existing microdiffraction instrument. PerkinElmer is the sole manufacturer and distributor.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 339112, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by October 31, 2014, 3:30 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

A Primary Theme Requirement defines a functional, rather than strictly geographic, leadership capability that can be projected, shared, or applied in other regions as needs dictate.</p>
<p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>B) <em>Secondary Capabilities Requirements. </em>Each RCC shall maintain capabilities to support leadership by other RCCs or NCDC in the provision of products and services in its region for sectors or climate-related issues beyond its region's Primary Themes.  The secondary sector support will be determined by the Regional Climate Service Directors (RCSDs) as needed.  Examples of secondary sectors and issues are agriculture, civil infrastructure, climate oscillation impacts, coastal hazards, construction, droughts, energy, floods, and wild fires, among others.</p>
<p>2)  <strong>National Capabilities Requirements to Support Regional Needs.</strong> National Capabilities are products, capabilities, or services which are required across all regions and do not require skills or expertise unique to one or more regions. The National Capabilities Requirements include:</p>

<p>Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, transportation and services necessary to perform the requirements for the Regional Climate Centers, except as noted in the Performance Work Statement.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make a decision at time of award and based on the proposals received whether it will award one (1) to six (6) separate contracts.  The Regional Service Requirement Contract Line Items will be Firm Fixed Price.  The National Capabilities will either be Firm Fixed Price or Time and Materials (as seen above). The contracts will have a base period of performance from approximately the beginning of April 2015 to the end of March 2016, and four (4), one-year option periods. <br /> <br />The proposed contract is full-and-open competition. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541712, and the size standard is 500 employees. All responsible and fully responsive sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.

If ISRs were not applicable to the similar contracts noted, submit other documentation which demonstrates utilization of the various small business category firms for the contracts.  If small businesses were not utilized, provide a detailed explanation.  A sample template for subcontracting history for newly established large businesses or large businesses with no prior ISR history is provided as Attachment 1.  Small business offerors shall submit documentation which shows utilization of the various small business category firms for similar contracts of relative size.  Note that small business offerors can and should include self-performed work for this sub-criteria.
  Small business offerors are also encouraged to utilize the sample template included as Attachment 1 to provide the required small business past performance information.  

Sub-criteria B - Utilization and participation of small business concerns for this contract.  All offerors shall provide information regarding the participation of small business concerns in this contract.

ii) Small Business offerors shall submit a Small Business Participation Plan, using the template at Attachment 3.  Small businesses can and should include planned self-performed work in Attachment 3.  Small business offerors are not to submit a Small Business Subcontracting Plan, but shall utilize the template included as Attachment 3 to submit the required subcontracting participation information.  

8.  Firms location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the contract. 

9.  Volume of Work:  Firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense (DoD) within the past 12 months with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A and E contracts among qualified A and E firms, including small and small disadvantaged business firms and firms that have not had prior DOD contracts.

<SUBJECT>ARTISANAL GOLD MINING - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REDUCTION PROGRAM

<RESPDATE>121714
<CONTACT>Miguel A Atuesta, A&A Specialist, Phone 5712754162, Email matuesta@usaid.gov
<DESC>ARTISANAL GOLD MINING - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REDUCTION PROGRAM
<p>The United States Agency for International Development in Colombia (USAID/Colombia) is soliciting responses to a Request for Proposals to support the Government of Colombia (GOC) in reducing the environmental impacts of small scale gold mining, with special emphasis on eliminating the use of mercury and recuperating degraded areas left by gold mining. The successful implementation of the program will result in a)improved, law-abiding mining operations in the target geographies, b) miners with legal, additional economic opportunities and c) degraded areas turned into productive uses with focus on commercial forestry plantations. <br />This five-year project is estimated at approximately $20 million which includes an activity (sub-awards) fund of 65% of the total budget. Strong participation of the private sector is expected, as well as involvement of the relevant counterparts in the GOC at local, regional and national levels. Artisanal and small-scale miners (ASM) in selected municipalities of Antioquia and Choco are the main target communities for this program.<br />The U.S. Government contemplates the award of a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) completion contract resulting from this solicitation. The period of performance is five (5) years.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVES, THEORY OF CHANGE</p>
<p>The USAID/Mining project will pursue two objectives:<br />(1) to build effective governance capacity for gold mining activities in target municipalities by strengthening public management functions and capacity building of local organizations with a stake in gold mining operations; and<br />(2) to increase GOC capacity to address environmental degradation by gold ASM operations, delivering improved water and air quality, and re-incorporating degraded areas to productive uses with a value chain approach.</p>
<p>USAID/Colombia's theory of change linking this project to these two objectives is that if regional and local authorities are more effective in enforcing mining-related legislation and the right instruments (education, rule-of-law, economic tools) are set to support environmental recuperation of degraded areas with participation of land owners, private sector and local communities, then regional and municipal authorities will gain legitimacy and support, improving social, environmental and economic performance of ASM operations and advancing Colombia's peace-building goals.</p>
<p>GEOGRAPHIC FOCUS</p>
<p>The program is expected to perform its major number of activities in two departments: Antioquia and Choco, since they account for almost 75% of the gold produced in Colombia. At the discretion of USAID, the program could work in additional geographies.</p>

BOAs are designed to provide enhanced contracting opportunities to qualified firms under the 8(a) program serviced by the U.S. Small Business Administration. The BOA is not a contract but a written instrument of understanding negotiated between the US Coast Guard, Civil Engineering Unit (CEU) Oakland, and the 8(a) firm to facilitate the expeditious acquisition of construction services, if and when ordered. The BOA contains contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms and conditions, which will apply to all task orders issued under the BOA according to the dollar amount of each task order. Annually, CEU Oakland will review the continued need for the BOA in light of (a) usefulness and need for services and (b) the effectiveness of individual contractors. The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program for new entrants once a year.

General contractors are preferred, but specialty contractors will be considered as well. Individual projects will be solicited and awarded if and when required.

The agreement can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issues hereunder. Either party may cancel the agreement with 60 days written notice to the other party. Any cancellation will not have any effect on task orders issued prior to the effective date of cancellation.</p>
<p>SOLICITATIONS: Each project solicitation will indicate the detail of pricing and technical information to be provided by the offeror, and evaluation criteria and the basis for award to be used for each project.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) <br>  <br> This is a Sources Sought Announcement and request for information only. This is not a Request for Proposals and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Government will take procurement action on this matter. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.  <br>  <br> The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing information provided under this Sources Sought Announcement. Responses will assist the Government in determining potential responsible sources and to determine the technical capability of the domestic production base.   <br>  <br>  <br> 1.  OVERVIEW <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Product Manager Soldier Maneuver Sensors (PM SMS) and the Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) are conducting a Sources Sought market survey to identify sources with the interest and capability to provide a Family of Weapons Sight (FWS) Crew Served (CS) system.  <br>  <br> The FWS CS goal is to acquire and field a standalone weapon mounted sighting device that meets the requirement of the approved FWS CDD.  The FWS CS will be developed for the M2, MK19 and M240 weapons and will provide day/night capability and will enable a crew served weapon gunner to more accurately engage targets in less time than with currently fielded products. This will be done by utilizing a Helmet Mounted Display and disturbed reticle that adjusts the reticle location based upon range data from an integrated laser range finder or from a Small Tactical Optical Rifle Mounted (STORM) Micro-Laser Rangefinder (MLRF). <br>  <br> 2.  REQUIREMENTS <br>  <br> The basic technical requirements are divided into categories to enable companies that have solutions in a particular field(s) to provide informational responses on their area of expertise. <br>  <br> 2.1.  System Requirements <br>  <br>  	The FWS CS system shall be able to survive MIL-STD-810G tests (weapon shock, salt/fog, immersion, temperature, etc.). <br>  	The FWS CS system shall meet MIL-STD-461 Electromagnetic Interface Requirements. <br>  	The FWS CS system shall meet AR 70-38 Hot basic and Cold -40 (T) -46 (O). <br> 2.2.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. <br /><br />I. BACKGROUND:<br /><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) provides global leadership for a research, training, and education program to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood diseases and enhance the health of all individuals. The Institute collaborates with patients, families, health care professionals, scientists, professional societies, patient advocacy groups, community organizations, and the media to promote the application of research results and leverage resources to address public health needs.<br /><br />The NHLBI, Extramural Research Program, Division of Cardiovascular Sciences (DCVS), Women's Health Initiative Branch (WHI) supports clinical trials and observational studies to improve understanding of the causes and prevention of major diseases affecting the health of women. Current studies focus on cardiovascular disease, cancer, and fractures, in collaboration with NCI, NIAMS, NIA, NINDS, and ORWH. The large multi-center observational epidemiology studies seek to identify risk markers for disease or better quantify known markers using questionnaire, clinical examination, and laboratory data. The large and long-term multi-center clinical trials test promising but unproven interventions such as hormone therapy, diet, and supplements to prevent major diseases and evaluate overall effects on health. The Branch has established an infrastructure to support the utilization of data and blood samples from the studies by the scientific community.<br /><br />II. Purpose and Objectives<br /><br />The proposed acquisition is a renewal of a requirement that supports the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) core operations and the follow up of clinical events. The objectives are to: <br /><br />&bull; expand knowledge about the determinants of cardiovascular disease in older women (and conversely determinants of successful aging with absence of cardiovascular disease)<br />&bull; expand the study as a scientific resource for the research community<br />&bull; mentor young investigators<br />&bull; facilitate a new generation of large simple prevention trials<br /><br />The current structure consistent of a Coordinating Center, four Regional Centers, and committee/scientific interest groups shall be maintained. <br /><br />Coordinating Center Core Functions: These functions relate to maintaining and updating the data and biologic specimens as well, as the continuing follow-up of outcomes in ~85,000 participants. <br />Core functions include: <br />&bull; coordinate this large and complex study; maintain investigator, public, and study participant websites and documentation/data resources; <br />&bull; make data and biologic specimens available to the research community; <br />&bull; provide data and analytic support for paper proposals approved by the Publications and Presentations Committee; <br />&bull; provide data and basic support for proposed ancillary studies and consortium studies; deposit curated data into BioLINCC and dbGAP at the required intervals; <br />&bull; update study files with clinical outcome, laboratory, and ancillary study data; provide support for administrative functions such as committee meetings and conference calls;<br />&bull; provide annual study updates to Steering Committee, NHLBI, and OSMB.
<p><br />Regional Center Functions: (not object of this requirement but described here for informational purposes): Participant follow-up and events adjudication. The functions of the Regional Centers are: <br />&bull; Continue outcomes documentation and adjudication in the Medical Records Cohort. Though the number of women followed decreases over time, numbers of outcomes remain high because of increased rates. These outcomes in aging women are critical to realizing the primary objective of the current renewal, i.e. the study of CVD related to aging. These and other adjudicated outcomes will continue to support any clinical trials funded during the current period, as well as any future trials, and in addition they anchor CMS and self-reported outcomes. <br />&bull; Continue collecting self-reported outcomes in the Self-Report Cohort. Self-reported outcomes are necessary to inform planning and conduct (including further documentation/adjudication of outcomes as needed) of ancillary studies and clinical trials. <br />&bull; Continue collecting data on activities of daily living and quality of life which are intrinsic to study goals.<br />&bull; Maintain optimal retention through mail contact and phone calls as needed to follow up on outcomes. <br />&bull; Continue mentoring young investigators though the Regional Centers. <br />&bull; Continue recruiting non-WHI investigators to collaborate or to analyze the data themselves. In the majority of cases WHI data are now being analyzed by the investigators themselves.</p>

<CONTACT>Beau Corbett, 904-232-1388

<a href="mailto:beau.corbett@us.army.mil">USACE District, Jacksonville</a>
<DESC>THIS IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT FOR AN UPCOMING INDUSTRY DAY ONLY.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-Jacksonville District (Corps) will hold an Industry Day for the Mile Point Reconfiguration Project, on Thursday, November 13, 2014 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at the Wyndham Jacksonville Riverwalk, 1515 Purdential Drive, Jacksonville, FL, 32207, in the St. Johns Room. <br>  <br> The project consists of constructing approximately 4,000 feet of a new West Leg Training Wall, removing approximately 3,300 feet of the westerly end of the existing training wall to elevation -12 feet MLLW, constructing approximately 2,100 feet of a new East Leg Training Wall, and dredging the confluence area to elevation -12 feet MLLW and the Flow Improvement Channel to elevation -6 feet MLLW plus 1-foot allowable overdepth.  All satisfactory stone material recovered from the existing training wall will be reused in the East Leg Training Wall.  All remaining material will be placed and contained in the Great Marsh Island Placement Area (Great Marsh Beneficial Use Site) unless otherwise specified.  Additional work includes clearing and grubbing, marine animal monitoring, bird monitoring, turbidity monitoring, and coordinating with the U.S Coast Guard to allow its crews to remove and reinstall three (3) aid-to-navigation (ATON) structures. <br>  <br> The majority of this work will take place in an open marine environment subject to wind, waves, tidal and river currents as well as seasonal storm activity.  It may be necessary to establish a stable work platform, such as jack-up or spud barge, in open water in order to perform the work within the required tolerances.  The work outlined above will require large quantities of material such as tens of thousands of tons of granite, thousands of feet of Geotextile Tubes, over 700,000 cubic yards of dredging and 4000 linear feet of Concrete Structural Units (CSUs).  A CSU is a standalone concrete structure that is designed to dissipate waves and redirect currents in lieu of large armor stone. A wall containment feature will be built behind or against the CSU's to retain the dredged material that will be placed into the Great Marsh Island Placement Area.  The CSU type and the wall containment feature are not prescribed and will require submittals for evaluation/approval regarding their ability to meet or exceed established performance criteria.  Experienced construction management and oversight will be critical in order to properly manage the workflow and sequencing of construction that must be followed in order to complete the project within the allotted performance period of 18 months and prescribed order of work. <br>  <br> THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. However, there is a set of DRAFT plans and specifications that has been posted on ASFI for interested parties to review prior to Industry Day. In order to prepare a list of attendees of individuals participating in this Industry Day, it is requested that an e-mail be sent to tedra.n.thompson@usace.army.mil identifying the name of the firm, the name and title of those individuals participating, their telephone number and e-mail address.  Please include a statement in this e-mail indicating whether or not Jacksonville District may include this information when posting and/or distributing the list of attendees. <br>  <br> The Industry Day will consist of Opening Remarks, Technical Presentation and a Question and Answer period with participants. <br>  <br> TO VIEW OTHER DOCUMENTS, SCROLL DOWN TO  quote mark ADDITIONAL INFO: quote mark , THEN CLICK ON  quote mark ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION quote mark  LINK.

<p>Brand Name Justification:<br /><br />The brand name equipment is requested in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 11.105 (a) (1). The brand name indicated in this solicitation is the only product that will meet the needs of the FBI. The FBI has a requirement to purchase a Leica Polarized Light Microscope. The Agency caseload requiring in-depth visual inspection, comparison and association of fibers on Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) has risen sharply, necessitating the purchase of additional microscopes. The Leica polarized light microscopes are the only ones compatible with the current agency inventory of Leica stereomicroscopes already in use. The specificity for the Leica microscopes is the three-dimensional imaging capability required for enhanced descriptions of fibers most commonly observed in improvised explosives. The FBI maintains an internal network on which images are stored on and compared. By alternating equipment, compatibility would not be possible. Procuring the new microscope will ensure continuity of operations, provide for a seamless transition, prevent excessive lack-of-compatibility costs, comply with current and future requirements, and enhance agency capabilities. The Leica polarized light microscope is the only microscope that will meet the needs of the FBI. <br /><br />***SPECIAL SOLICITATION INFORMATION***<br /><br />The equipment in this solicitation will be used in a new building currently under construction for the FBI in Huntsville, AL. The equipment cannot be installed until after the FBI has taken possession of the building, which is tentatively scheduled for early-t0-mid October 2014. However, due to the large amount of equipment that needs to be installed, it may be several months before installation of this equipment may occur. By submitting a quote, the Offeror understands that if it is the awardee, it cannot invoice and/or receive payment until after the equipment has been installed and final acceptance has been made by the FBI.<br /><br />FAR 52.247-34, (Nov 1991) - FOB Destination: FBI/TEDAC Huntsville, ATTN: Stephanie Futrell, 4940 Fowler Road, Redstone Arsenal AL 35898. All deliveries shall be coordinated at least 48 hours in advance with Stephanie Futrell, (571) 359-8711 and stephanie.futrell@ic.fbi.gov. Failure to notify the recipient(s) in advance will result in the shipment/delivery being refused. All re-delivery costs shall be borne by the contractor. Please specify method of delivery, i.e. FedEx, flatbed, etc. - No deliveries shall be scheduled via USPS. <br /><br />The contractor shall extend to the Government full coverage under a normal commercial warranty.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)<br />The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 12 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Regional Specialist position was developed in response to a significant increase in USAID's portfolio of countries that face various forms of fragility or crisis as well as an increase in demand for OTI's experience and programming methodology. As USAID's lead operational unit for crisis intervention programming, OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially-based technical advice and analysis, and explore countries that face possible political crises earlier in order to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and to be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.<br /> <br />As a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Yemen, Europe, Eurasia and Asia (YEA) team, the Senior Regional Specialist will be based in Thailand and will report to the Washington-based OTI YEA Team Leader. As the senior OTI representative in the field, the Senior Regional Specialist will represent and serve as a liaison between OTI and a wide array of individuals and institutions including USAID Field Missions, other DCHA office representatives, regionally based officials from the State Department, the Department of Defense, and other agencies of the U.S. Government, international organizations, and the non-government community abroad on political transition, conflict and post-conflict issues in the region. The Senior Regional Specialist will visit, as necessary, ongoing OTI programs in the region as well as proposed and potential country program sites, serving as OTI's senior official in the region, and may be called upon to support other regions as needed. The Senior Regional Specialist will serve as the agent of the OTI Team Leader and, when designated, will have supervisory authority when working with OTI country teams. This position will include extensive travel, particularly within the Yemen, Europe, Eurasia and Asia region.<br /> <br />In the unforeseen event that the position can no longer be posted in Thailand, the incumbent would need to be immediately available for frequent and possibly long-term temporary duty assignments within the region.  The incumbent may be required to live in temporary quarters or in a hotel in a neighboring country for indefinite periods of time, and would receive applicable allowances at the rate in effect at the destination post at the time of travel.</p>
<p>The Senior Regional Specialist will train, mentor, backstop, and support OTI country teams, including Country Representatives, Deputy Country Representatives, and other staff on the OTI business model, procedures, minimum program requirements, and best practices. He or she will help to determine the learning and training needs of in-country staff, and contribute to broader office policy and process discussions to promote state-of-the-art transition programming. Through coordination with OTI's Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) team, the Senior Regional Specialist will stay abreast of current thinking, policy determinations, lessons learned and best practices from other regions, while at the same time cultivating and sharing best practices found in the field. Through on-the-ground knowledge of OTI country programs, the Senior Regional Specialist will contribute to the refinement of OTI's learning and training strategy, training regimes, and materials for staff in country programs as well as office surge staff known as the Bullpen.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the OTI Senior Regional Specialist requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Senior Regional Specialist is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both inside and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Yemen, Europe, Eurasia and Asia (YEA), with an additional direct line of reporting to the Director of the USAID Regional Development Mission, the OTI Senior Regional Specialist will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide technical assistance and support to regional and bilateral missions experiencing political transition, conflict, and post-conflict issues;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide expertise to OTI regional teams and the Senior Leadership Team on OTI strategic planning;</p>
<p>&bull;	Travel to current or potential OTI field locations and Washington, DC, if required, to provide expertise on OTI field programming through assessments, country program reviews, or consultations. Provide said consultations and assessments on best practices and lessons learned to develop guidance and training materials. Travel may also be required to attend regional conferences and workshops. Provide readouts when practicable and appropriate to the regional and Applied Best Practices and Coordination (ABC) teams;</p>
<p>&bull;	Support ongoing OTI programs in the region on a temporary duty (TDY) or remote basis, including but not limited to serving as Acting Country Representative or Acting Deputy Country Representative when required;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor regional developments related to OTI's mission and mandate. Provide ongoing analysis and regular reporting to the Regional Team Leader on current political developments, security concerns and other pertinent information from the region for informed decision-making;</p>
<p>&bull;	When required, lead and/or contribute to assessments for possible new country start-ups, and steer new country analysis for OTI;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure effective and well-managed OTI country programs by performing independent analysis of program operations, and helping to mentor, train, and provide consultation to the Country Representative, Deputy Country Representative, and other members of in-country Senior Management Teams (including implementing partner staff where appropriate) on OTI's business model, programming methodology, applicable historical references, observed personal and corporate lessons. Advise at strategic, programmatic and activity levels to ensure the overall success of OTI programs in the region;</p>
<p>&bull;	Actively support learning and training in OTI by linking, contributing to, and refining observed lessons and best practices from the field, program, and personnel requirements to the main body of OTI knowledge through the ABC team;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's representative, regional focal point and liaison for new country start-ups, strategic analysis and dialogue with senior U.S. Government officials and representatives throughout the region;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide advice to the OTI Regional Team Leader about the direction and implementation of country programs, and the performance of in-country staff. Work with the Regional Team Leader and relevant country teams to devise strategies for the improvement and success of OTI programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by Embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick-impact programming model. Support to Embassies and USAID Missions may also include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including but not limited to rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as assigned by OTI/Washington in support of OTI's worldwide mission, including other representational duties in support of OTI programs if required.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Regional Specialist will be supervised by the Washington-based OTI Regional Team Leader for Yemen,  Europe, Eurasia and Asia (YEA) or his/her designee as part of OTI's Field Programs Division, and will also have additional reporting responsibilities to the relevant Mission Director when applicable.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The supervisor will provide administrative directions in terms of broadly defined missions or functions. The employee will independently plan, design and carry out programs, projects, studies or other work assignments. The employee's work will be considered technically authoritative and normally accepted without significant change, and will be reviewed in terms of fulfillment of program objectives or influence on the overall program.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

      (B)  Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and
      (C)  Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. 
    (ii)  If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. 
   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.

<p>Please note this is a notification that a solicitation has been posted at: https://ebs.pnnl.gov/ViewSolicitation.aspx?SolID=498</p>
<p>If interested you are directed to refer to that solicitation for all relevant information and updates. <br /><br />Battelle is re-posting the solicitation for PR 280124. The reason for this is that we received no financially responsive proposals that where within our current budget. We are therefore re-posting the RFP in hopes of clarifying our expectations and receiving proposals closer to our budgeted amounts.</p>
<p>We want to make it clear that proposing a weather delay or standby rate to cover the vendors risk of unexpected bad whether does not make the overall proposal non responsive as indicated on page 10 of the SOW. We anticipated that deployment and recovery operations would take approximately 1 day to complete.</p>
<p>In addition, we reserve the right to award multiple contracts as a result of this solicitation. As a result we will consider proposal for only some of the tasks; for example Task-6, Emergency Retrieval and Re-Deployment, Task-7 Routine Maintenance, Retrieval and Re-Deployment, and Task 8-Routine Service Visit, if in the best interest of Battelle and the Government we may choose to award under a separate contract.</p>
<p>Please note we revised some of the RFP requirements specifically related to the financial proposals. (See RFP Rev 2) No changes to SOW Rev 1.</p>
<p>Please submit questions or comments by October 23, 2014.</p>

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS/ SOLICITATION <br />HSCG40-14-Q-19005<br />NORTHERN LIGHTS OEM PARTS
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />I. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.

Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.</p>
<p>(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or (2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in paragraph (l) (1) or (l) (2) of this clause and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.</p>

This is not a Request for Proposals and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Government will take procurement action on this matter. Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.   <br>    <br>  The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing information provided under this Sources Sought Announcement. Responses will assist the Government in determining potential responsible sources and to determine the technical capability of the domestic production base.    <br>    <br>    <br>  1.  OVERVIEW  <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army Product Manager Soldier Maneuver Sensors (PM SMS) and the Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) are conducting a Sources Sought market survey to identify sources with the interest and capability to provide a Family of Weapons Sight (FWS) Crew Served (CS) system.   <br>    <br>  The FWS CS goal is to acquire and field a standalone weapon mounted sighting device that meets the requirement of the approved FWS CDD.  The FWS CS will be developed for the M2, MK19 and M240 weapons and will provide day/night capability and will enable a crew served weapon gunner to more accurately engage targets in less time than with currently fielded products. This will be done by utilizing a Helmet Mounted Display and disturbed reticle that adjusts the reticle location based upon range data from an integrated laser range finder or from a Small Tactical Optical Rifle Mounted (STORM) Micro-Laser Rangefinder (MLRF).  <br>    <br>  2.

OVERVIEW      <br>            <br>      The U.S. Army Product Manager Soldier Maneuver Sensors (PM SMS) and the Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) are conducting a Sources Sought market survey to identify sources with the interest and capability to provide a Family of Weapons Sight (FWS) Crew Served (CS) system.       <br>            <br>      The FWS CS goal is to acquire and field a standalone weapon mounted sighting device that meets the requirement of the approved FWS CDD.  The FWS CS will be developed for the M2, MK19 and M240 weapons and will provide day/night capability and will enable a crew served weapon gunner to more accurately engage targets in less time than with currently fielded products. This will be done by utilizing a Helmet Mounted Display and disturbed reticle that adjusts the reticle location based upon range data from an integrated laser range finder or from a Small Tactical Optical Rifle Mounted (STORM) Micro-Laser Rangefinder (MLRF).      <br>            <br>      2.

OVERVIEW       <br>              <br>       The U.S. Army Product Manager Soldier Maneuver Sensors (PM SMS) and the Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) are conducting a Sources Sought market survey to identify sources with the interest and capability to provide a Family of Weapons Sight (FWS) Crew Served (CS) system.        <br>              <br>       The FWS CS goal is to acquire and field a standalone weapon mounted sighting device that meets the requirement of the approved FWS CDD.  The FWS CS will be developed for the M2, MK19 and M240 weapons and will provide day/night capability and will enable a crew served weapon gunner to more accurately engage targets in less time than with currently fielded products. This will be done by utilizing a Helmet Mounted Display and disturbed reticle that adjusts the reticle location based upon range data from an integrated laser range finder or from a Small Tactical Optical Rifle Mounted (STORM) Micro-Laser Rangefinder (MLRF).       <br>              <br>       2.  REQUIREMENTS       <br>              <br>       The basic technical requirements are divided into categories to enable companies that have solutions in a particular field(s) to provide informational responses on their area of expertise.       <br>              <br>       2.1.

OVERVIEW        <br>                <br>        The U.S. Army Product Manager Soldier Maneuver Sensors (PM SMS) and the Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) are conducting a Sources Sought market survey to identify sources with the interest and capability to provide a Family of Weapons Sight (FWS) Crew Served (CS) system.         <br>                <br>        The FWS CS goal is to acquire and field a standalone weapon mounted sighting device that meets the requirement of the approved FWS CDD.  The FWS CS will be developed for the M2, MK19 and M240 weapons and will provide day/night capability and will enable a crew served weapon gunner to more accurately engage targets in less time than with currently fielded products. This will be done by utilizing a Helmet Mounted Display and disturbed reticle that adjusts the reticle location based upon range data from an integrated laser range finder or from a Small Tactical Optical Rifle Mounted (STORM) Micro-Laser Rangefinder (MLRF).        <br>                <br>        2.

If time permits, the Government will attempt to provide answers during the conference.  Answers to all questions submitted will be provided at a later date and posted to Fed Biz Opps.  <br>  <br>  <br> The purpose of this amendment is to revise the response date for questions, comments, and suggestions from 14 October 2014 to 06 October 2014.  <br>    <br>    <br>  This is a draft Request for Proposal and is not a formal solicitation. In an effort to promote a clear understanding of this requirement, the Government is soliciting comments and suggestions from potential Offerors. The goal is to obtain a more effective and less costly contract.   <br>      <br>   Potential Offerors are invited to submit questions, comments, and suggestions on any aspect of the draft solicitation via email to Ms. Keyonna Hogan at keyonna.l.hogan.civ@mail.mil   <br>   All questions, comments and suggestions shall be received by 1600 hours 14 October 2014.   <br>      <br>   Depending on the number of questions, comments and suggestions the Government intends to post all responses within approximately 15 calendar days after the response date.    <br>      <br>   The Government intends to conduct a formal pre-solicitation conference in the October 2014 timeframe.  Additional details will be forthcoming.   <br>      <br>   Changes, as appropriate, to the Government's requirement will be incorporated into any resultant formal solicitation, which will be posted to the ASFI website.    <br>      <br>   The Joint Project Manager for Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPM-RND is tasked to provide a standard Department of Defense (DoD) Radiological Detection System (RDS) that will replace the Joint Services current radiation detection, indication and computation (RADIAC) systems. The RDS will provide increased capability and enable the Joint Services to effectively conduct joint operations with interoperable equipment, by providing a network centric, rugged radiation detection capability for detection of the entire spectrum of radiological and nuclear hazards and threats.    <br>      <br>   The proposed RDS contract will include a ten (10) year period of performance which will be implemented in three (3) phases. Phase I is expected to be a 36-month effort and includes the System Integration and Demonstration to include design, development and manufacture of 14 test articles as well as support of government test activities.   <br>      <br>   Phase II includes the low rate initial production (LRIP) as Option 1, which may be exercised at the discretion of the Government based on need and results achieved in Phase I. Phase II is expected to be a 36 month effort for the production of 30 radiological detection systems. Phase II also includes ancillary support efforts as options.    <br>      <br>   Phase III includes Full Rate Production (FRP) as Option 2 which may be ordered over a five (5) year period at the discretion of the Government based on need and results achieved in Phase II. Phase III includes an Option for Initial Spare and repair parts.    <br>      <br>   It is anticipated that Phase I and Phase II (if exercised) will be awarded as a base  quote mark C quote mark  type contract. Phase III, if exercised will convert the base  quote mark C quote mark  type contract to a separate indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) type contract for administrative purposes to permit the ordering of hardware on an individual delivery order basis.    <br>      <br>   The Government anticipates up to three (3) awards will be made from this solicitation.   <br>      <br>   The Performance Specification contains technical data that is export controlled. Export of this data is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751 et seq.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (Title 50, U.S.C., App 2401 et seq.). Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.   <br>      <br>   Additionally, Section J Attachments of this solicitation contain controlled data whose access is restricted.    <br>      <br>   The export controlled technical data and the controlled data items can be accessed electronically via the Federal Business Opportunities website (https://www.fbo.gov) with valid contractor login credentials.   <br>      <br>   Once directed to the Federal Business Opportunities Website search for the RDS solicitation and follow these steps:   <br>      <br>   1) Log in Log in using your Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) code   <br>   2) Select  quote mark Request Explicit Access quote mark    <br>   3) Select  quote mark Verify MPIN quote mark    <br>   4) This will generate an email to the FBO System Administrator   <br>   5) Please allow 2-3 working days to complete the FBO-TDP process from the FBO system   <br>   6) The FBO Administrator will provide notice of contractor approval or denial for access to the contract specialist, who will then grant  quote mark Explicit Access quote mark  to the controlled data.   <br>      <br>    For more specific instructions on how to access controlled data and requesting explicit access view the FBO Vendor Guide at https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=getstart&mode=list&tab=list&tabmode=list&static=guides   <br>      <br>      <br>   All questions concerning this proposed procurement should be directed to Keyonna Hogan, Contract Specialist, via email: keyonna.l.hogan.civ@mail.mil or Diane Dei, Contracting Officer, via email: diane.v.dei.civ@mail.mil.   <br>

We need to anchorage the tent. We understand that we cannot puncture the surface but we have to use concrete block of 2000Kg to respect the German Law about temporary structure. The fields is enough strong to support 2000Kg per m ? We can use steel plate for a better weight repartition? <br>  <br> 	A1.  Concrete blocks are acceptable to anchor the structures; however, the contractor shall make every effort to distribute the weight over a larger surface area (steel plates, etc).  The concrete block shall not be directly placed on the field.  Additionally, the contractor shall make every effort shall be made to keep the total weight low (within the confines of German law and safety concerns) and to keep the blocks inconspicuous and out of trafficked areas. <br>  <br> Q2. We need to put a trackway to bring the concrete at the both side of the tents. Can we put a trackway to protect the artificial turf or we have to rent a crane to bring them? <br>  <br> 	A2.  Track may be laid on the field to allow the blocks to be placed on the tents. If used, the contractor shall ensure the track provides layered protection to the field from wheeled vehicles and distribute weight to the fullest extent.  Vehicles shall not be driven at high speeds over the track or directly on the soccer field. <br>  <br> Q3. We need to know where if we can get on the area with a forklift and where is the entrance on the map of enclosure 1. <br>  <br> 	A3. The entrance to the change of command area is via the road near Tent 1 (reference enclosure 1); access to the soccer field for wheeled vehicles is from the corner of the soccer field between Ten 4 and Tent 5 (reference enclosure 1).  Fencing, seating, and landscaping prevent entrance to the field from any other location for wheeled vehicles. <br>  <br> Q4. What about the berry amendment if the price is higher that maximum allow by this amendment?  <br>  <br> 	A4.  Based on market research, the Government does not anticipate that the price will exceed the threshold for the tent rental.   The PRICE SCHEDULE on the first page of the solicitation is revised to include the following: Offeror shall provide a firm, fixed price for the package, inclusive of all cost elements.  The offeror shall include a price breakdown that identifies the cost of the tent rental.  The Government will evaluate price for fairness and reasonableness in accordance with FAR 13.106-3. <br>  <br> Q5. If I understand well we need to put a protection artificial turf like trackway under the tent number 2, 3 and 4?  <br> 	 <br> 	A5. Specifications, paragraph; 4.2. is revised to read as follows:   quote mark Two large tents measuring at least 45 meters in length by 20 meters in width. These tents must provide coverage over 250 chairs each. These tents will be set up on the soccer field and must have a flooring system, with liner, protective pads or other means of protection, to ensure no damage is done to the soccer field turf from chairs, foot-traffic, or tent poles. The width of the tents may be extended to accommodate seating for 250 chairs, but must not exceed 30 meters in order to leave room on the field for the ceremony. The length of the tents cannot change. The tents must have sidewalls along the outside of the structure, open in the front. The red line on Encl. 1 shows where the sidewalls need to be. contractor shall ensure that the surface of the soccer field is protected from punctures and ensure maximum weight distribution.  <br>   <br> Q6.  Tent number 1 can only be set up in a size of 9 x 12m because of the tree. If this tent has to be placed on the marked position, can it be placed on the bushes at the green strip?  <br>  <br> 	A6.  A 9x12m tent is acceptable for the usage of the tent.  No tents shall damage the landscaping already in place. <br>  <br>  <br> Q7.  What is the maximum weight the turf can be applied to? <br>  <br> 	A7.  Awaiting response from RA. <br>  <br>  <br> Q8. What do you understand by  quote mark with liner quote mark ? <br>  <br> 	A8. The requirement for flooring  quote mark with liner quote mark  is to help maximize weight distribution and to further protect the surface of the soccer field.  A plastic liner (or equivalent protection system) should be placed over the field prior to arranging flooring above it.  The bottom line is to distribute weight and to ensure that there is absolutely no puncturing of the football field. <br>  <br> Q9.  Usually the set- up of such a tent accommodation including wooden floor and ballasting system (no anchorage!) - concerning the special circumstances right at the field - takes 3-4 days at minimum and to tear down it will take 2-3 days at minimum. Is that realistic? <br>  <br> 	A9.  Every effort shall be made to meet the timeline specified in the requirements.   The tents shall be set up and ready no later than the date specified in the requirements.  Offerors shall include a estimated timeline for set up and tear-down with their offers.    <br>  <br> Q10. The artificial turf may only be entered by personal staff, but no heavy trucks, cranes or forklifts! Is that correct? <br>  <br> 	A10. If a track system can be used to protect the field (as described in Q.2), small weight forklifts and trucks, driven at a slow speed may enter the field, but may not remain on the field during the ceremony. <br>  <br> Q11. What do you mean by  quote mark 10 meters queue system quote mark ? <br>  <br> 	A11.  We need to ensure people going through Tent 5 (reference Enclosure 1) are lined up in an orderly fashion prior to entering the tent.  We would like to have a system to ensure that the last 10 meters prior to the tent has a system to guide people in line to the tent's entrance (like a waiting line system at the airport).   <br>  <br> Q12. Even only the weight of the structure itself will puncture the turf! Is that a problem? <br>  <br> 	A12.  The turf shall not, under any circumstances, be punctured.  The turf is artificial and is expensive to install, replace, and maintain.  Every effort shall be made to protect the surface of the soccer field.  The turf shall not be punctured, pierced, drilled, etc in any way. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

Stoller Corporation (Stoller), a contractor to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking&nbsp;a subcontractor in the St. Louis&nbsp;metro area&nbsp;to provide services&nbsp;for site planning and preliminary design for a U.S. Department of Energy site located in St. Charles County, MO, approximately 35 miles west of St. Louis. The site was formerly the location of an explosives production plant in the 1940s and a uranium refinery in the 1950s and 1960s. An extensive environmental cleanup was performed and an onsite disposal cell was constructed to provide long-term isolation of waste materials. The current mission of the site is to perform long term surveillance and maintenance activities and provide educational and research opportunities to the public.
<p>These site planning and preliminary design services are required to replace an existing Visitor Center, staff office building, and an environmental sampling/site maintenance building. The specific location of this project area was not part of the former historical production areas.</p>
<p>The parameters of this project include:</p>
<p>&bull; Replace existing structures with a 2 story building (total of approximately 30,000 square feet)<br />&bull; New building must comply with Guiding Principles for Federal Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings<br />&bull; New building must be ADA compliant<br />&bull; A comprehensive evaluation of needed site infrastructure upgrades (e.g. electrical, waste water treatment, site drainage, etc.) is to be performed<br />&bull; Issues regarding site access from the main highway and an on-site traffic plan need to be evaluated</p>
<p>This project entails performing site planning and preliminary design, with potential options for detailed design followed by construction.</p>

<DESC>***This modification changes the response date to 20 October 2014.*** <br>  <br> The Vicksburg District Corps of Engineers is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) from large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) for the following project:   <br>    <br>  New Orleans to Venice, LA,   NOV-07a, Reach B1, West Bank Back Levee, Empire to Fort Jackson, Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana   <br>    <br>  Project Description: The work consists of raising 6 miles of hurricane protection levee, raising 7 miles of flood side wave berm, and two levee crossing ramps. The overall length of the project area, including non work areas, is 12.8 miles. Work includes, but is not limited to construction of two access roads and bridges for access; clearing, grubbing and grass removal; placement and compaction of contractor supplied embankment material; hydro-seeding with fertilizer and mulch for turf establishment; placement and compaction of crushed stone surfacing on ramps and access roads; installation of reinforced concrete culverts; fabrication and installation of two steel vehicle access gates; and installation of stone erosion protection.  <br>    <br>  Range of Magnitude: $25 Million to $100 Million.  <br>    <br>  Period of Performance: 359 calendar days after Notice to Proceed.  <br>    <br>  Some of the factors that may be considered regarding the use of Project Labor Agreements are:  <br>    <br>  a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in multiple crafts or trades.  <br>  b. The complexity of the project.  <br>  c. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.  <br>  d. Completion of the project will require an extended period of time.  <br>  e. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects.  <br>  f. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.  <br>  g. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.  <br>  h. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.  <br>    <br>  A Project Labor Agreement is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy provides that:  <br>    <br>  a. Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>    <br>  b. An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will:  <br>    <br>  1. Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br>    <br>  2. Be consistent with law.  <br>    <br>  Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.  <br>    <br>  In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:  <br>    <br>  1. Do you have knowledge that a PLA has been used in the local area on projects of this kind? If so,please provide supporting documentation?  <br>    <br>  2. Are you aware of skilled labor shortages in the area for those crafts that will be needed to complete the referenced project? If so please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.  <br>    <br>  3. Are you aware of time sensitive issues/scheduling requirements that would impact the rate at which the referenced project should be completed? If so, please elaborate and provide supporting documentation where possible.  <br>    <br>  4. Identify specific reasons why or how you believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.  <br>    <br>  5. Identify specific reasons why you do not believe a PLA would advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in federal procurement.  <br>    <br>  6. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the use of a PLA on the referenced project.  <br>    <br>  7. Please identify any additional information you believe should be considered on the non-use of a PLA on the referenced project.  <br>    <br>  Please provide your comments via e-mail to Christy Love, Contract Specialist at Christy.J.Love@usace.army.mil no later than close of business on 20 October 2014.  <br>    <br>  Agency/Contracting Office:  <br>  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg District  <br>    <br>  Place of Performance:  <br>  Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana  <br>    <br>  Point of Contact:  <br>  Christy Love  <br>  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Vicksburg District  <br>  CEMVK-CT-C  <br>  Christy.J.Love@usace.army.mil  <br>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of Acquisition Management (OAQ), proposes to enter into a contract on a basis of other than full and open competition for the Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), San Francisco Field Office, located at 800 Truxton Ave., Bakersfield, CA 93308. ERO's mission is to enforce the nation's immigration laws. ICE/ERO transports removable aliens from point to point, manages aliens in custody and removes convicted criminals who pose a threat to national security, fugitives and recent border entrants. ICE Agents are required to complete annual fire arm training, requiring access to a firing range.
<p>The firing range is used as part of ICE/ERO Defensive Tactics for continuance of training and recertification for officers quarterly, as per the July 07, 2004 ICE Interim Firearms Policy and May 24, 2006 Memorandum on Advanced Firearms Training Exercise. The range used for qualifying, must be outdoors to provide tactical practice, and qualifying (the shooters move around a course rather than at stationary "lanes"). The range must allow the use of high powered rifles and any handgun provided by the service for use in tactical situations.</p>

<p>1. The Department of State Office of Acquisition Management (AQM) is conducting this acquisition on behalf of DS/IP/OPO for local guard services at the U.S. Embassy Madrid, Spain. The estimated cost is $3,278,179.24 (twelve month cost).</p>
<p>2. Nature and/or description of the action being approved.</p>
<p>The action to be approved is the award of a sole source bridge contract to the incumbent contractor, Segur Iberica, S.A., C/Juan De Mariana, 15, 28045-Madrid, Spain (hereafter "Segur Iberica").</p>
<p>The current contract, SAQMMA09C0052, expires September 30, 2014. The competitive solicitation is progressing but will be unable to standup at the end of the current contract to provide a safe and secure environment for personnel at the U.S. Embassy and outlying locations.</p>
<p>The Embassy, the Office of Overseas Protective Operations under the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), along with AQM, seek approval to award a sole-source contract for local guard services at the U.S. Embassy Madrid, Spain to Segur Iberica. The subject contract will be for a base period of eight (8) months with four, one (1) month option periods, while a new solicitation and contract award is conducted.</p>
<p>3. A description of the services required to meet the agency's needs.</p>
<p>Local guard security services are required to ensure a safe and secure environment for the U.S. Embassy Madrid to conduct its foreign policy mission. The local guard services prevent unauthorized access, protect life, maintain order, and deter criminal attacks against employees, dependents, property and terrorist acts against all U.S. assets, and prevent damage to Government property. The local guards act as an early warning signal to the U.S. Embassy and the Regional Security Officer. <br />4. An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. &sect; 253(c)(2). The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency.</p>
<p>5. A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.</p>
<p>The Department of State's essential need for security services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits proposals. Segur Iberica is the incumbent contractor currently providing services and they possess a valid security license. They are the only firm capable of providing a fully vetted and equipped guard force with all necessary licenses in the time remaining. Personnel without the necessary training and clearance could cripple Embassy operations; and, jeopardize the mission and security of the Chief of Mission.</p>
<p>6. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intention to solicit and compete the follow-on requirement. <br />7. A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>The contractor's anticipated costs are in line with their proposed rates from the competitive solicitation. In addition, cost analysis is required to establish fair and reasonable pricing before award of the bridge contract.</p>
<p>8. A description of the market survey conducted and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted and there appears to be two or more licensed security firms in Spain who can potentially perform a follow-on contract. However, these companies cannot stand up a fully trained and vetted guard force for this bridge contract within the time required.</p>
<p>9. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy Madrid cannot operate with a break in local guard services. Security for the U.S. Mission is of the utmost importance. A lapse in local guard service could cripple Mission operations, jeopardize the Mission, and possibly lives.</p>
<p>10. A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.</p>
<p>Due to the urgency of this requirement, the Department of State limited the number of sources considered to firms with the capability of providing trained and cleared guards up to U.S. Embassy standards, located in Western Europe, with the financial resources to rapidly deploy services to remote areas, and the means to quickly take over management of a local guard force in Spain.</p>
<p>11. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. Include a statement that this J&amp;A for other than full and open competition will be published on FedBizOpps in accordance with FAR Section 6.305 within 14 days of award (or within 30 days if the J&amp;A is for unusual and compelling urgency.)</p>
<p>Under FAR Section 6.305(b), this notice will be posted on FedBizOpps within thirty (30) days of award. Furthermore, AQM promotes competition for award of all local guard contracts. Acquisition Management is currently and will continue to compete this requirement to the fullest practicable extent necessary for the subsequent acquisition.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	Department of Veterans Affairs	
	New Mexico VA Health Care System___
		(NMVAHCS)_______________________
	1501 San Pedro SE	
	Albuquerque, NM 87108	
                                                                          VISN:	NCO 18	

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
The New Mexico VA Health Care System (NMVAHCS), located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, requires annual maintenance and repair services for the Medtronic StealthStation S7 Surgical Navigation System.  The government intends to entered into a new, firm-fixed-price, task order with Remi Group, LLC., 11325 North Community House Rd., Suite 300, Charlotte, NM 28277, for the required services.	


(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
Correct function of the Medtronic SteathStation S7 is vital to the performance of the NMVAHCS Surgical Service and is used directly in patient surgical procedures.  The Surgical Navigation Systems allows surgeons greater precision and monitoring during surgical procedures, allowing for more complex and safer procedures and more positive outcomes.  The NMVAHCS requires a maintenance and repair service agreement to maintain correct equipment function.  The period of performance will begin at award, 09/26/2014, and will consist of one (1) base year, followed by up to four (4) additional option year periods.	


	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $233,714.00	

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   09/26/2014	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
The Medtronic StealthStation S7 Surgical Navigation System is currently in use by the NMVAHCS surgical department.  The equipment maintenance and repair services are no longer covered under initial warranty.  The StealthStation S7 is proprietary to the manufacturer in parts, hardware, software, and trained service technicians.  The StealthStation S7 is not compatible with any other system, parts, or software.  Medtronic USA, Inc. can provide the services through an open market purchase.  However, Remi Group, LLC. covers maintenance and repair of the StealthStation S7 under their GSA contract, GS-21F-0093V.  Remi Group, LLC. takes responsibility for receiving and tracking service calls, and then subcontracts directly with Medtronic USA, Inc. for the maintenance and repair portion.  Through their GSA contract, Remi Group, LLC., can offer a substantial discount over Medtronic USA, Inc. industry pricing.  No other GSA contractor was identified as capable of proving the services.	

0	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________

0	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
Pricing for these services was provided by Medtronic USA, Inc. and an analysis indicates Medtronic is offering the government an 8% discount over their standard pricing offered to industry for equivalent services.  Pricing was also provided from Remi Group, LLC. under GS-21F-0093V.  It was determined that Remi Group, LLC. has quoted a 26% discount as compared to Medtronic USA, Inc. standard industry pricing.  Therefore, it is determined that the use of the GSA contract, offering the greatest overall saving, is in the best interest of the government.


(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Market research was conducted in accordance with FAR Part 10, utilizing the hierarchies listed in FAR 8.002(a)(2).  Medtronic USA, Inc. was identified as the manufacturer of the SteathStation S7 system.   National Acquisition Center (NAC) contract, V797P-2110D, was identified on mandatory Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) 65 II A - Medical Equipment and Supplies, category A-41 - Electrosurgical Apparatus.  Mr. Barney Carter, with Medtronic USA, Inc., Medtronic Surgical Technologies, was contacted in reference to the StealthStation S7.  Per Mr. Carter the StealthStation S7 is proprietary to Medtronic in hardware, software, parts, and service and cannot be maintained or repaired by any third party contractor.  Mr. Carter stated that the maintenance and repair services for the StealthStation S7 system are not available under their NAC GSA contract, and that services would need to be procurement through open market procedures.  In addition, optional FSS 03FAC - Facilities Maintenance and Management, category 811 006 - Facilities Maintenance and Management Consulting was identified as containing potential contractor, Remi Group, LLC.  In total, one hundred-sixteen (116) GSA contract holders were contacted.  Of those contacted, twenty-one (21) contractors responded in writing.  One (1) contractor indicated that they were capable and interested in providing the services.  Per Jack Jaimes, Remi Group, LLC., the services are included in their GSA schedule GS-21F-0093V, and services would be rendered by Medtronic USA, Inc., acting as a subcontractor.

Additionally, a sources sought notice was issued to www.fbo.gov under VA258-14-I-0883 from 09/04/2014 to 09/08/2014.  There were zero (0) responses from industry, as a result of the sources sought notice. 

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
The Medtronic StealthStation S7 Surgical Navigation System has previously been repaired under the manufacturer's warranty.	

 (8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
At this time the government has two (2) options when procuring these services.  The first is to award a task order to Remi Group, LLC. under their GSA contract.  The second is to contract directly with Medtronic USA, Inc. using open market processes.  At this time there are no actions the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to restricted consideration.	

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.
