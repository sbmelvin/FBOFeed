<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Amendment 000003
This announcement has been amended (on 26 December 2011) to include the following changes to the 25 November 2011 Posting:

The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of updates to the technical requirements since the November 25th 2011 announcement. These updates are contained in the latest Draft version of the NVS Technical Specification (V.0.12) dated December 26, 2011. This is the last Draft version of the NVS Technical Specification prior to the anticipated release of the final SIR early in calendar year 2012. This announcement meets the commitment to provide an updated Section 3.4 Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and Service Life Requirements of NVS Technical Specification and includes incremental updates, based on industry feedback gathered from various calendar year 2011 RFI responses, prior to releasing the final SIR.  Updates to the NVS Specification since the November 25 2011 announcement are identified in the "red-lines" version.  The FAA is also in the process of reviewing the industry responses submitted in regards to the December 21st 2011 due date requested in the November 25th announcement. The FAA is in the process of assessing these responses; therefore, any final adjustments to the Draft Interface Requirements Documents (IRD), provided during the September 2011 announcement, will be included with the final SIR. Also, in concert with the RFI feedback and in cooperation with the FAA, EUROCAE has developed and published a set of documents that define the Interoperability Standards for Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) for Air Traffic Management (ATM) components, also designated EUROCAE ED-137A, in four parts: Part 1 - Radio, Part 2 - Telephone, Part 3 - Recording, and Part 4 - Supervision.  The NVS has some unique requirements not covered by ED-137A.  The FAA has worked with EUROCAE to have these unique NVS requirements included in the next release of ED-137.  Other parties have proposed a number of other enhancements that will also be part of the next edition of ED-137. Because the formal approval and release of ED-137B will not occur before the release of the NVS SIR, the FAA has prepared three Addenda in order to consolidate, identify and document these enhancements as applicable to NVS.  These Addenda are:
 Addendum to ED-137A Part 1, Radio - Radio Remote Control (RRC) Header Extension. Addendum to ED-137A Part 2, Telephone - Override Call (OVR) Addendum to ED-137A Part 3, Recording
The content of this announcement is being only for Industry information, to acknowledge various calendar year 2011 RFI industry responses. The FAA is not asking for any comments to these drafts or the 137A addenda. Inquiries must be sent via e-mail to: dana.d.brooks@faa.gov.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.

The draft SIR is intended for comment only.  This announcement is NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) OR A REQUEST FOR OFFER and the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.

The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the changes incorporated to the draft SIR sections posted in September 2011 and provide draft versions of the remaining sections. 
Specific updates on the NVS Specification since the September 2011 draft announcement include replacement and updates of G/G Communications (Sections 3.1.2.2 thru 3.1.2.2.4); addition of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Requirements (Section 3.1.2.7); removal of the ATIS Monitoring Requirements; replacement of the Security Requirements (Section 3.1.3); clarification to Throughput Timing Requirements (Table 3-8 in Section 3.2.2.1); replacement of Training Mode Function (Section 3.1.16);  Addition of Battery Monitor Requirements in section 3.5.1.1.4; Addition of Surge Protection Requirements (Section 3.5.1.1.6) and updates for Software Requirements (Section 3.6). 
Section 3.4 Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, and Service Life Requirements is still under FAA review.  Per comments received from all previous RFIs, the FAA intends to clarify the definition of system failure as related to the cumulative loss of resources and the size of an AVN (e.g. interfaces, positions), as well as other Section 3.4 updates.  Time permitting; the FAA intends to post an update to Section 3.4 before the final SIR.
The Interface Requirements Documents (IRD) provided with the September 2011 announcement is still considered current.
The FAA is anticipating releasing the final SIR early in calendar year 2012.  Although this draft is being released primarily for Industry information, the FAA is asking for any comments to the draft to be provided in Microsoft Office 2003 editable format.  Please provide any responses in writing to the FAA Contracting Officer, Dana Brooks, by 12:00 p.m., Eastern Time, December 21, 2011.  Responses must be sent via e-mail to: dana.d.brooks@faa.gov.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.
Interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or costs incurred as a result of responding to this announcement.  All costs associated with any response are solely the responsibility of the responding party.
