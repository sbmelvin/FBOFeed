<DESC><p>The Air Force has a research and development requirement to mature and demonstrate available technologies in a Large Class 92 inch diameter Stage 1 Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) and to demonstrate a potential Family of Motors (FOM) capability applicable to future propulsion systems. It includes design modifications to an existing Large Class motor followed by fabrication and static fire demonstration of that motor. The contract constructs include 3 Phases, the basic with two options which represent a phased approach to accomplishing the total mission requirement over a five year period. The program is conducted under the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Propulsion Applications Demonstration/Validation funding to support the demonstration of technologies applicable to future strategic programs.<br />The contract will be accomplished in three phases. The effort in Phase I is directed toward a Stage I static firing demonstration of a 92-inch motor based on a specific criterion for size and performance and is the first of three phases in an overall five year research and development effort. Specifically, Phase 1 is comprised of building and static fire testing of a large class 92 inch SRM. The program is a continuation of a program to qualify a domestic motor case material in a hydrostatic burst test. This latter program is funded by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) located at Edwards Air Force Base, California. <br />The two option phases include the fabrication of additional motors to support government programs. The first option consists of fabricating an all-up Stage I to support a government flight test program. The second option consists of fabricating another motor to support a government aging/surveillance program.<br />Specific requirements for this contract for all Phases include:<br />1. Performance Criteria stipulating an ideal delta velocity (assuming zero g and zero drag) of no less than 6,500 feet per second to a mass of 93,250 lbm.<br />2. Physical Criteria: <br />a. 92 inch nominal diameter and a length of 350 inches with a maximum mass of 120,000 lbm that includes the aft skirt, raceway, external insulation, and all other associated stage hardware. <br />b. Thrust vectoring actuators shall employ an electro-mechanical system. <br />3. Design Criteria: <br />a. The motor case design and manufacturing procedures and standards shall be identical to that currently being demonstrated at the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) under a separate 2008 Family of Motors Demonstration program. The case design shall incorporate specific materials, parameters, and processes that demonstrate compliance to the 2008 AFRL standard.<br />b. Design modification of an existing motor shall be limited to evaluation and analysis of design features which meet or exceed the performance criterion stipulated in the Statement of Objectives.<br />c. Emerging technologies shall be evaluated for potential benefits to optimize present and future missile configurations as identified in the Statement of Objectives.</p>
<p>Electronic procedure will be used for this solicitation.<br />To: ATK Launch Systems, Corrinne, UT., 84307 Authority: 10U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsilble source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<CONTACT>BAA Coordinator, Email DARPA-BAA-09-11@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of computer network protocols.  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances over the current state of the art.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.

The Military Networking Protocol (MNP) program will develop a network prioritization system with full user-level attribution for military computer networks.  The protocols, techniques, and devices developed in the program will de-anonymize network data flows for those computers and network enclaves using MNP technology.  Clearly identifying network traffic will allow the network infrastructure to explicitly provide prioritization levels at both the individual and unit level, reallocate bandwidth between users or classes of users, and automatically make quality of service decisions.  The de-anonymized MNP traffic will be compatible with and transit existing Internet infrastructure carrying legacy Internet traffic.  MNP-enabled networks may allow or deny entry or transit by unauthenticated data flows, and will transmit data as fast as (or faster than) existing legacy network protocols.  Hardware developed in this program will be self-configuring and will greatly reduce the need for trained network personnel and overall networks maintenance cost.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.

BACKGROUND
The Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) is committed to a comprehensive program of scientific innovation and excellence in the areas of arthritis, muscle, bone, skin and rheumatology.  Within the IRP, the Laboratory of Muscle Biology under the leadership of the Chief, Kuan Wang, Ph.D. focuses, among other goals, on the molecular structure of skeletal muscle in an effort to better understand the mechanism of muscle contraction in order to  improve therapies for muscle diseases   X-ray diffraction has been used as one of the methods of choice since it is one of the few non-invasive techniques such that molecular structures can be determined at atomic resolution while the muscle is fully functioning.  The long term goal of our research is to understand the molecular processes underlying muscle contraction. Muscle contraction is a result of interactions between the proteins, myosin and actin by using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as the energy source. The mechanism of transforming the energy stored in the molecule ATP (chemical energy) to mechanical energy (moving objects) has been a subject of intense research for many years. The reason for such strong interest is that most of the motile processes in living cells such as cell division and nutrient transport, appear to follow similar principles as those found in muscle contraction. The knowledge gained from studying muscle contraction thus far has benefited research work in many other dynamic cellular functions. Focused on the study of changes in actin and myosin that enable the muscle to produce force and to move objects. Although the sliding filament model of muscle contraction is well accepted, the structural details of the mechanism have proved to be difficult to establish because the underlying processes are rapid (millisecond time scale) and the interactions are not synchronized. However, it is known that as the myosin molecule (acting as an enzyme) hydrolyses ATP, it passes through several intermediate states. One way to study the structural details is to study structures of each individual state within the ATPase cycle. For this purpose, we have been using ATP analogues that trap the myosin molecules in individual intermediate states. X-ray diffraction is the technique of choice, since it is one of the few non-invasive techniques that allow direct observation of molecular structures in living muscle cellsIn recent years, Dr. Leepo Yu and a research team discovered, among other accomplishments, that the structure of myosin filament in muscle cells directly reflects the state of the nucleotide bound at the active site of the myosin molecules and the readiness of muscle to contract.  The team further introduced the concept that there are multiple conformations coexisting simultaneously in the myosin molecules. These findings greatly facilitated the research in ways to control contraction.  However, further evidence is needed to fully establish the validity of these new concepts.

Task Performed are as follows:


1.	During the contract period the consultant shall perform some control experiments that will be carried out and a required revision will be completed and resubmitted to the journal.  The effects of binding blebbistatin to myosin on the filament structures. A manuscript Stabilization of Helical Order in the Thick Filaments by Blebbistatin. Further Evidence of Coexisting Multiple Conformations of Myosin has been submitted to the Biophysical Journal for publication.


2.	During the contract period the consultant shall conduct some X-ray experiments that will be carried out (see (4) below ) and a manuscript will be prepared for submission for publication. A tentative title will be: Mechanical and Biochemical Characterization of the Fast Psoas Muscle from the Model Mice for Pompe Disease


3.	During the contract period the consultant will collaborate with Drs. Paul Plotz, Nina Raben and Robert Horowits, all of IRP, NIAMS on the mechanical biochemical and structural characterizations of the fast skeletal muscle in the mice model of Pompe Disease, and a manuscript will be prepared for submission for publication.

4.	All of the projects stated will fulfill the mission of NIAMS in supporting research into the causes, treatment and prevention of musculoskeletal diseases and obtain proprietary data.  These experiments are needed to complete the projects (1) - (2),  X-ray diffraction experiments. The consultant will advise and consultant with a research team to carry out X-ray diffraction experiments at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY.

Note: The results will benefit the governments need for research in the areas related to muscle and cardiovascular diseases.

	The consultant service level of effort is not to exceed 640 hours.
	
	The period of performance is from date of award to March 15, 2009.
	
 

	The Government anticipates that there will be one performance based service       contract awarded for this requirement.
	
	
	Sole Source:
	
	Dr. Yu is a world renowned expert in studying muscle structure and function.  Her specialty is applying x-ray diffraction techniques to living muscle cells. There are only few research teams in the world that conduct such experiments with comparable accomplishment.  The research team discovered the relation between thick filament structure and the state of the myosin.  The projects (1)-(2) stated above are further extension of that discovery.  With her experience, expertise and exposure to proprietary data only Dr. Yu will be able to continue and complete the projects.
	
	Deliverables: The consultant will meet the needs of the NIAMS, as they arise, within general guidelines provided by the assigned Project Officer (PO). This will be in the form of specific monthly written reports as set by the PO. A final inspection and acceptance of all work performed of experiments and data analysis by the consultant will be performed by technical assistance from IRP, NIAMS personnel.
	

Place of Performance:  Government will provide laboratory space on the NIH Campus and, computing facilities and travel expenses to the National Synchrotron Light Source.
	
	This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.  National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Carlos Colantuoni, Ph.D. to perform data analysis and exploration for a large gene expression project. Using brain samples from several Brain Collections in the NIMH combined with commercial Illumina microarrays, this project will produce an unprecedented resource documenting genome-wide expression changes in the brain across the lifespan. Since prior efforts, this project has been expanded to include approximately 500 subjects including normal controls and subjects with neuropsychiatric diagnoses. Additionally, this project will include a comprehensive range of ages across the human lifespan, with coverage from fetal development to aging.

The study will investigate the expression of >45,000 transcripts in two brain regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus) as they vary across the lifespan. The resulting million's of data points require rigorous quality control and normalization to ensure data validity, and in-depth functional analysis to reach an understanding of their biological significance. Novel approaches to exploratory analysis of global transcriptional trends in brain across the human lifespan.  One of the primary goals of this project is to provide this dataset as a public research tool to the neuroscience research community. To this end, Dr. Colantuoni will deposit this entire dataset in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo). In addition, he will contribute to the construction of a custom web tool making the searching and visualization of this vast dataset accessible to biologists. 

Dr. Colantuoni has a degree in psychology and a doctorate in neuroscience.  He has performed many services with the application of genomic techniques, bioinformatics tools and the statistical analysis to research questions in neuroscience.  He currently is a summer professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health Graduate Summer Institute on Epidemiology and Biostatistics.  He has also organized a weekly seminar in the Department of Biostatistics, directed specifically at covering topics in bioinformatics, gene expression analysis, and genomics.

<DESC>Brand Name Mmandtory Rental of HAKI TraK Roofing System to support Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth NH 03801.  Solicitation to be issued on 10/29/2008.
The proposed requirement is to rent a Haki Trak 750 temporary roof system and to procure additional sheets of the roofing system for use on the NR1, which will cover the entire boat.  ThyssenKrupp Safway, Inc. has been the only company that provided a quote for a temporary roof that met the specifications.  It is the only roof that has a temporary sheeting, that can be rolled back in sections to open up specific areas of the enclosure to allow movement of materials in and out by crane.   The Haki roof section is rolled back from either side by a worker standing on a platform.  This takes only a few minutes to accomplish.  All other temporary roofing systems that have removable sections require several workers to get on top of the enclosure to disassemble and reassemble the roof.  This takes much longer and proposes a safety hazard.   The use of the Haki Trak 750 temporary roof system saves many manhours and dollars, as well as providing a safer work environment  This tempora! ry roof system is used to provide an enclosure for drydock #1 to protect the ships and workers from exposure to the weather.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Using radiofrequency (RF) technology and a physical property called permittivity, XDS can detect the start of an extravasation under the patient's skin and signal the Stellant to stop injecting until a clinician can examine the patient.  Employing RF technology and permittivity minimizes false positives detections.  "False positives" can interrupt workflow and inhibit productivity. (They are a major reason why extravasation devices using indirect detection method of impedance and resistivity are not being adopted.)  Installation from company supplying system is required since installation by any other party would void warranty.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  Parties may identify their interest, accompanied by supporting literature, to the Contracting Officer no later than Thursday, October 30, 2008, 4:30 p.m.  Responses should be sent to Michelle.Urso@va.gov.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  It is the belief of the Government that there is currently only one responsible source capable of providing this equipment to satisfy the agency requirement.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System will proceed with the sole source procurement from Medrad, Inc.

<p>5950015374338 160D145222-5 LIGHTING TRANSFORMER BOX ASSEMBLY</p>
<p>The technology insertion will consist of a Form, Fit, and Function Interface (F3I) replacement of the current LRU's with more reliable, longer-life LRUs that carry a 5 year warranty and have a Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of at least 5,000 hours. The F3I replacement LRUs will be made of components that will be supportable through 2030, the projected lifetime of the A-10, so as to avoid Diminishing Manufacturing Sources Diminishing Supply (DMSMS) issues, and will utilize technology that maintains the ability to be modifiable so as to support unforeseen future modifications to the A-10.<br />The Air Force plans for the technology insertion of the LRUs to include production articles as well as engineering and repair services. The engineering services include; prototype development and fabrication, bench testing, system integration testing, flight testing, test equipment upgrade, and technical data and technical order maintenance. The repair services would consist of repair of the LRUs and shop replaceable units that would be subassemblies of the redesigned LRUs.<br />The F3I procedure encourages the procurement of items using performance based acquisition specifications versus build -to- print requirements. The procurement/services will be based on "Best Value" to the government, not necessarily requirements. The LRUs will incorporate state of the art technology and will be compatible with existing hardware and software interfaces in order to maintain F3I equivalence. The information in this request is provided to assist the USAF in conducting a market survey of industry to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort. This is neither a request for proposal nor an invitation for bid. We are seeking contractors interested in designing and/or manufacturing high reliability LRUs using modern technology rather than traditional build to print requirements.<br />Interested parties are requested to submit two copies of a summary of their capabilities and facilities that will allow them to design, test, service and/or manufacture the new LRUs. A Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and an estimate of the anticipated time between contract award and first flight article delivery are also solicited to aid in the budgeting and scheduling process. The ROM is for planning purposes only and the contractor will not be bound by these preliminary estimates. This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that procurement will be accomplished. The government does not intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.<br />Written responses must be submitted by 26 Nov 2008 to OO-ALC/LGKE, ATTN: Louis Cornell, Bldg 1215, 6050 Gum Lane, Hill AFB, Utah 84056-5825. No telephone or Fax responses will be accepted.<br />For answers to technical questions please contact 1Lt Jacob English at (801) 777-9520 jacob.english@hill.af.mil or Mr. Alva Maynor at (801) 777-7406, email alva.maynor@hill.af.mil. For contractual questions please contact Mr. Louis Cornell at (801) 777-6044, email louis.cornell@hill.af.mil.</p>

The Direct Servicing Agent provides day-to-day servicing of policies of flood insurance issued directly by FEMA pursuant to the NFIP.
                                                                      
Procurement Objectives include: (1) Maintain, in an uninterrupted manner and to program and contract standards, the day-to-day servicing of directly written standard flood insurance policies, Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL) and Group [National] Flood Insurance Program (GFIP) Policies including underwriting, claims examination and payment, financial accounting, and reporting.

<a href="mailto:tardiffc@mms.gov">Tardiff, Christy C</a>
<DESC>DESCRIPTION:This announcement solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the Minerals Management Service (MMS) Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program on Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and other safety issues.  When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistently with prior hurricane research.  For a summary of TA&R research performed for recent hurricane events, visit http://www.mms.gov/tarprojectcategories/.  
BACKGROUND:   During the hurricane season of 2008, Hurricanes Gustav and Ike moved through the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) with extreme winds and waves impacting offshore Oil and Gas infrastructure in their paths.  MMS wishes to analyze and assess the consequential damage to facilities, pipelines, and other infrastructure from these storms as well as identify ways to minimize or eliminate similar impacts in the future.  As a result of the White Papers submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement, selected proposals shall be requested.  Proposals selected for funding by MMS shall receive funding from FY 2009 supplemental funding. The MMS anticipates that between $400,000 and $800,000 may be available for the initiation of new research addressing Hurricane Gustav and Ike topics identified through this announcement.  The MMS expects the majority of funding to focus on Hurricane Ike since Ike appears to have caused greater impact to offshore Oil and Gas operations.   NOTICE:  MMS may share the White Papers with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors shall notify  MMS if they do not want their White Papers/proposals shared.
OBJECTIVE: The topics for the FY 2009 Hurricane Safety Research funding should be limited to the following: 
1. Compile metocean data for Ike and Gustav for use by MMS and MMS contractors performing hurricane assessment. Update metocean design criteria;2. Determine the forces that were experienced by offshore production structures during Ike and Gustav and whether the size of the hurricane-strength wind field had a predictable effect on the size/height of resulting waves;3. Assess damage and failure mechanisms for offshore structures and pipelines. These results may be used in validating the adequacy of current design methodology and standards;4. Determine whether inspection methods conducted in accordance with and in addition to NTL No. 2008-G18 are the most effective methods for finding and determining the extent of primary and secondary storm damage.  Should the water depth range for conducting subsea inspections vary for different category storms? Should every mile of pipeline within the impact area be inspected;5. Determine the factors contributing to the toppling of jackup rigs during Ike as well as those experiencing extensive damage;6. Compare the performance of mooring systems versus that which was projected in pre-drilling risk assessments.  Consider revisions and updates that would improve assessment tools and further reduce the risk of mooring failures; 7. Assess hurricane damage mitigation options for new and existing facilities; and8. Conduct a risk analysis of using a surface blow out preventer (BOP).  Include the risk of a riser failure.  Investigate parameters including high and low bottom hole pressure, length and type of riser, type of drilling vessel (moored MODU and DP MODU) and/or production vessel ( TLP, SPAR and FPU), and riser integrity management plan.  Address the following:a. Is a subsea BOP required for high bottom hole pressure when drilling in deep water?b. Is a subsea shut off/shear device required?c. Discuss the situation of low bottom hole pressure.
HOW TO RESPOND: White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORIGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format, on a CD, shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of Interior, Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN: Ms. Christy Tardiff, not later than November 28, 2008 at 5:00 PM, EDT.

<CONTACT>Deborah C Britton, Phone (301) 594-5914, Fax (301) 435-8675, Email dbritton@cc.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a Source Sought Market Survey to determine the availability and potential capability of small and large businesses to provide skilled individuals who are certifiably trained in services of  Patient Care Unit Clerks within the Clinical Center that is a research facility. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561320.  NIH is the steward of medical and behavioral research for the Nation.  Its mission is science in pursuit of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to extend healthy life and reduce the burdens of illness and disability.  The NIH Clinical Center serves as the nations premier research hospital for conducting clinical research to improve the health of humankind.  The Clinical Center also serves as the national resource for clinical research by fostering dynamic interactions with outside partners; developing diagnostic and therapeutic interventions; enhancing systems to ensure the safe, efficient , and ethical conduct of clinical research; training clinical researchers; and leaving the clinical research response to the nations emerging public health needs.

The Clinical Center Complex of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is located in Bethesda Maryland.  The Clinical Center is the hospital of the NIH consisting of 242 inpatient beds, 90 day hospital stations, outpatient clinics, diagnostic and treatment areas, and public waiting areas.  Adjacent to the hospital facilities are research laboratories.  The complex consists of the Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center (Magnuson Center) that covers 661,600 sq. ft. and the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (Hatfield Center) that covers 870,000 sq. ft.  The Magnuson Center is fifty years old and had a substantial addition completed in 1981 which is called the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (ACRF).  

The purpose of these services is to provide consistent and reliable Patient Care Unit Clerk (PCUC) staffing for the various patient care units and patient care support areas within the NIH Clinical Center.  Twenty-eight (28) positions have been designated to be filled by contract staff on an ongoing basis.  In addition, there will be a need for intermittent patient care unit clerk staffing services to cover planned/unplanned leave of contractor staff and government vacancies.  These services will be performed in various locations throughout the Clinical Center, including: inpatient units, outpatient clinics, diagnostic testing areas, surgery, admissions, centralized scheduling and the patient travel voucher office.

The Clinical Center has a need for dedicated and committed individuals to perform in a healthcare environment that is aligned to the NIH mission.  The Contractor(s) shall, on a consistent basis provide contract personnel to provide Patient Care Unit Clerk staffing services.  This may include a contractor staying beyond their assigned tour of duty to meet the program of care needs.  This contract will be managed by the Ambulatory Care Services Department of Nursing and Patient Care Services at the NIH Clinical Center.  The contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that staff assigned to this contract will provide consistent and reliable services meeting all the requirements of the specific position and meeting program needs.  The contractor(s) shall be responsible for providing appropriate staff coverage in a timely manner when a contractor is on planned and unplanned leave to ensure continuity of services.  Personnel working in all the areas will be interacting in-person and by phone with patients, visitors, physicians, nurses and other staff and it is important that the contractor personnel provide outstanding, consistent customer service for all customers.  Patients that are seen at the NIH Clinical Center may be anxious, fearful, sick, have physical deformities etc.  In addition, many of the patients and families are not from the local area and this sometimes creates additional anxiety.  It is extremely important that the contract personnel maintain a consistent high level of customer service and convey understanding, responsiveness, care and compassion.

The duties to be assigned to Patient Care Unit Clerks will only entail what is specific to the area assigned.  The Government will provide all training required to perform the duties.  

At a minimum, the contractor must provide information to show pertinent experience related to their hiring practices and internal training in adequately forwarding candidate profiles for review and approval by the Program Officials for the various positions within the research facility.  This information should include but not limited to : (1) The pool of qualified candidates and their training within a research facility such as NIH Clinical Center or healthcare facility; (2) Experience the contractor has in successfully managing long-term staffing assignments in patient areas of a health care facility along with providing back-up personnel for planned/unplanned leave of primary individuals; (3) Customer Service Training which certifies contractor staff to handle the type of patients within the work area assigned; (4) Give a general background of your organizational structure; lines of authority and qualifications of essential officials and management staff; (5) In staffing this type of contract provide a description of how qualified applicants will be provided for potential placement; (6) Does your agency have policies and procedures in place for counseling employee staff internally who have attendance or performance issues; (7) What type of recruitment plan does your agency have in place in recruiting and retaining of well qualified and high performing employees; (7) Does the agency have supervisory personnel that monitor employee staff and subsequent replacements.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice.  This notice is a mechanism for obtaining feedback from industry in regard to the general requirement stated below.  THIS IS NOT A SYNOPSIS FOR A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).  Rather, it is a market research tool to determine potential sources prior to the issuance of a solicitation.  The Government is not obligated to, nor will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Sources Sought Notice.  

The United Stated Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Procurement Operations Headquarters, Science and Technology (S&T) Acquisition Division is seeking interest from potential sources in supporting the DHS S&T Directorate, Human Factors Divisions (HF) Indicators of Intent to Use Improvised Explosives (IEDs) available in Blogs to support the Counter-Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED) Program.  

DHS plays a major role in fulfilling Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)19, Combating Terrorist Use of Explosives in the United States, including national policies, strategies and implementation plans for the prevention and detection of, protection against, and response to terrorist use of explosives in the United States.

Terrorists have repeatedly shown their willingness and ability to use explosives as weapons worldwide.  There is ample intelligence to support the conclusion that they will continue to use such devices to inflict harm. The threat of explosive attacks in the United States is of great concern considering terrorists' ability to make, obtain, and use explosives, the ready availability of components used in IED construction, the relative technological ease with which an IED can be fashioned, and the nature of our free society. 

It is the policy of the United States to counter the threat of explosive attacks aggressively by coordinating federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal government efforts, and collaborating with the owners and operators of critical infrastructure and key resources to deter, prevent, detect, protect against, and respond to explosive attacks, specifically with regard to applying techniques of psychological and behavioral sciences, such as social network theory, in the analysis of potential threats of explosive attack.  As the use of the internet by terrorists has increased, blogging and message boards have played a substantial role in allowing communication among those who would do the United States harm.  In order to better counter the use of IEDs, it is necessary to identify speech acts in near to real-time which proceed the decision by terrorists to use an IED.

In support of this requirement, the following tasks may be required:  1)  meeting with DHS representatives to further refine requirements under this effort.  In particular, DHS representatives will provide additional information regarding the types of information that needs to be collected from blogs and message boards (amount of discussion about IED technology, depth of discussion about IEDs, support for use of IEDs, etc.).  2)  developing objective, systematic data collection and retrieval techniques to gather data on a near real-time basis from blogs and message boards.  Data will be collected at multiple, pre-determined times to evaluate the transmission of information over time, and should include metrics for determining the impact factor and usage patterns of the blogs and message boards.  3)  identifying blogs and message boards utilized or favored by groups that engage in violent or terrorist activity to include in the study.  Blogs and message boards must be representative of various characteristics of the larger populations of interest. and  4)  collecting quantitative and qualitative data from the bloggers to evaluate such issues relating to knowledge of the preparation and execution of violent activities, including IED attacks.

<DESC>The Office of the Federal Detention Trustee (OFDT) in support of the United States Marshals Service (USMS)/Bureau of Prisons (BOP), is conducting a Sources Sought synopsis for information purposes only. This is not a solicitation announcement. Currently, no solicitation is available. This request for information does not commit the Government to pay any cost incurred in preparation of any submission to this Sources Sought Notice.

The purpose of this request for information is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. After review of the responses to this sources sought synopsis, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be publicized in FedBizOpps. All interested offerors will be required to respond to the solicitation announcement in addition to responding to this sources sought synopsis. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.

OFDT awarded an Intergovernmental Agreement IGA #60-01-0027, between OFDT and the Mahoning County Sheriffs Department, 110 5th Avenue, Youngstown, Ohio 44503, for housing Federal detainees at the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center. OFDT is considering terminating the IGA and awarding a contract to the Mahoning County Justice Center for a period of not less than 10 years, however, not more than 20 years. OFDT considers these services available only from the original source which is for the continued provision of highly specialized detention services and it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

The anticipated scope of services to be provided and their respective functional areas are detailed below: 

OFDT is in search of existing detention facility located within the geographic boundaries of Youngstown, Ohio with a capacity of not less than 600 beds to house persons in custody of USMS/BOP with federal offenses and detained while awaiting trial or sentencing, a hearing on their immigration status, or deportation.

<DESC>I.	INTRODUCTION
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Office of Acquisition (OA) is issuing this Request for Information for market research purposes only.  The TSA seeks to identify electronic tools (e.g. web based, software, etc.) available to assist with the procurement source selection process and the capability of the vendors who offer these tools.  This is not a request for proposals or quotes, and may not result in a procurement.  If a future procurement is forthcoming, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps. 

II.	BACKGROUND
The Office of Acquisition provides mission-focused acquisition and contract services to the TSA.  The TSA spent more than $2.7B in FY2008 to buy everything from airport screening equipment and canine training to leading-edge IT managed services and human resources support.  The Office of Acquisition primarily functions as the business advisor and consultant for the planning, award and management of TSAs acquisition program.

III.	SYNOPSIS OF REQUIREMENT
The TSA seeks to identify what electronic tools (e.g. web based, software, etc.) and/or methods are available in the commercial marketplace to assist the OA with managing the source selection process for a range of possible procurements from simplified acquisitions and GSA federal supply schedule purchases to complex full and open type competitions.  The TSA seeks a source selection management tool that can improve the consistency of the documentation and evaluation process amongst the evaluators specific to different types of acquisitions, increase the security of evaluations and corresponding documents, and demonstrate a measurable return on investment.  Lastly, although each acquisition is unique in its requirements, the evaluation process is essentially the same with each type of procurement (e.g. federal schedule buys, etc.), thus, it is also desirable that this tool helps standardize the evaluation process for all procurement types.

 
IV.	INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS

<DESC>Description:<BR>This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI) and product samples.  This is not an Invitation to Bid nor a Request for Proposals.  There is currently no acquisition funding available for this effort. However, Product Manager Soldier Sensors and Lasers (PM SSL) has a requirement to conduct a Product Evaluation Test (PET) for the Crew Served Weapons Light (CSWL), a component of the Army Family of Flashlights. This is a market survey to identify any manufacturers who have commercially available CSWLs that will interface with current weapon systems in the Army inventory; the M2 Series Heavy Machine Gun and the MK-19 MOD III Grenade Machine Gun. While sources are sought that can provide Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items that are already in production, Non Developmental Items (NDIs) that can be delivered for comparative testing by 20 January 2009 are also acceptable. Five samples will be required for the PET process. PM SSL requests that interested parties submit five product samples and necessary technical data to the addresses given under Responses below by 20 January 2009. It is further requested that responses be limited to one product model per vendor. The samples will be tested in accordance with the requirements described under PET System Requirements listed below and will be returned following testing along with final test results for each product. Units that perform well during the PET and are appropriately priced will be placed on the Armys Approved Family of Flashlights List (AFFL) and will be entitled to display the AFFL sticker on their approved product.<BR><BR>CSWL Mounting Requirements Familiarization Exhibit:<BR>To help vendors prepare to participate in the PET, PM SSL will sponsor a CSWL Mounting Requirements Familiarization Exhibit at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ on 1 through 5 December 2008. Participation in the familiarization exhibit is voluntary.<BR><BR>Each vendor will be given a dedicated block of time to familiarize themselves with the M-2 and MK-19 weapons in both the mounted configuration with the Objective Gunner Protective Kit (O-GPK) and the dismounted configuration with a machine gun tripod mount. Further, they will see how the CSWL must mount on the weapons when a thermal sight and an aiming laser are also on the weapon. They will be given the opportunity to mount their CSWLs on the weapons in the various configurations; however, there will be no live firings or demonstrations of the vendor's lights. It is mainly an exhibit for the vendors to get hands-on experience with the CSWL mounting requirements. Technical experts from PM Crew Served Weapons, PM Tactical Vehicles (O-GPK), the Armaments Research, Development and Engineering Center (ARDEC), and the Aberdeen Test Center (ATC) will be available to answer questions.<BR><BR>The familiarization exhibit will be open to all vendors.

Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work/statement of objectives and performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.<BR><BR>Background / Objective: <BR>The Government (US Army Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center) is interested in receiving information on technologies, components and concepts that could lead to the design, development, delivery and demonstration of an all-digital satellite communications (SATCOM) terminal capable of operating in the military X and K/Ka bands.  For the receive path, the goal is to be able to simultaneously digitize the entire downlink band of the Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS) satellite (500 MHz bandwidth at X-band, 1 GHz bandwidth at K band), provide the digitized signals to a programmable modem processor, and simultaneously demodulate a large number (TBD) of signals. For the transmit path, the goal is to be able to digitally synthesize a number (TBD, comparable to current strategic earth terminals) of transmit signals at the input to the terminals power amplifier. <BR><BR>Solutions using an L-band intermediate frequency (IF) or direct conversion from and to X-band and K/Ka band are both of interest.  Discussion of system capabilities, scalability, issues and trade-offs of each approach is of interest.<BR><BR>Discussion of system trade-offs involved in the application of direct digital synthesis to the transmit capability at X and Ka bands is of interest.<BR><BR>The potential integration of an all-digital transceiver into enterprise terminals and transportable terminals (e.g., Phoenix) are of interest.<BR><BR>All terminals used on the WGS constellation have to be certified.

<RESPDATE>120108
<CONTACT>Helen B Nelson, Phone 860-441-2843, Email helen.r.nelson@uscg.mil
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is part of a market research effort to assess industry capabilities that will best address the United States Coast Guards needs.  The Coast Guard Research and Development Center (R&DC) is tasked by Congress to determine the most effective Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) to operate off the National Security Cutter (NSC).  The project was initiated with a study of the environmental, Concept of Operation (CONOP) and physical constraints associated with operation of a UAS from the NSC.  The project is now at a point where it needs to solicit feedback from Government, industry and academia to identify potential sources of suitable UASs.  

The Coast Guard is currently building new NSCs which are flight deck equipped cutters (FDECs). The NSCs will conduct most of the Coast Guards missions, including counter drug law enforcement, migrant interdiction, living marine resources (aka fisheries enforcement), and defense readiness.  The NSCs will often operate independently, relying on their own sensors to surveil, detect, classify, identify, and prosecute (SDCIP) targets of interest.  Through multiple analyses previously conducted, the R&DC has shown that properly configured UASs may offer significant benefit to USCG mission execution.

The USCG R&DC intends to use the information collected from this RFI to conduct detailed analysis that reflects State of the Technology capabilities. These capabilities will be assessed by the R&DC in terms of contribution to NSC Mission performance metrics. Information obtained through this RFI may also be used to identify systems for Advanced Technology Demonstrations (ATDs) currently planned for mid 2009. 

Notional Operational Profiles

(1)  UASs will perform surveillance to support the NSCs in the detection, classification, identification and tracking of surface targets while providing near real-time data to the NSC.

(2) UASs will loiter over targets of interest while providing near real-time data to the NSCs.

(3) UASs will relocate previously detected targets and perform a classification and identification.

You are invited to respond with information to assist the Coast Guard R&DC with its market research to identify potential sources of cutter-deployed UASs (including platform, payloads, Ground Control Station (GCS), and control and data links).  For purposes of this RFI, UASs are the aerial vehicles, payloads (i.e., radars, Electrical Optical/Infra-Red, Automatic Identification System, Directional Finder, etc.), and control and communications capabilities. The Coast Guard is interested in technology that can be operated and maintained on NSCs operating anywhere in the worldwide maritime environment.

Attachment A is provided to assist you in responding to this RFI.  Attachment A consists of one worksheet provided for informational purposes only (NSC_Constraints) and three worksheets to be submitted in response to this RFI (RFI Data Parameters, EO IR Data Sheet and Radar Data Sheet).  It is essential to complete the RFI Data Parameters and EO IR Data Sheet and Radar Data Sheet, if applicable. 

The Coast Guard R&DC intends to conduct a rigorous analysis of all potential platforms and payloads. Therefore, we request that you (1) provide detailed information on your products that meet or exceed the criteria listed below and (2) complete the data sheets provided as Attachment A Worksheets (RFI Data Parameters, EO IR Data Sheet and Radar Data Sheet).


Criteria (Not in Any Particular Order)
 
(1)  UAS shall be able to be launched and recovered, operated, maintained, and hangared on the NSC (see Attachment A Worksheet NSC Constraints for general information)

(2)  UAS platform shall be capable of carrying and supporting mission applicable payloads that include sensors and C2 systems

(3) UAS sensor payloads shall be capable of detecting, classifying, identifying and tracking targets in the maritime environment

(4)  UAS command and control payloads shall be capable of permitting the NSC to maintain positive control of the platform, and providing for the near real-time transmission of data (radar, EO/IR, etc.)

(5)  UAS platform shall use fuels compatible with the NSC shipboard environment (MOGAS and AVGAS is prohibited for shipboard use)

(6)  UAS (platform, payloads, and full fuel load) shall be able to be handled on deck by ships personnel, and operated and maintained by Coast Guard personnel under all expected operational conditions

Responding to This Market Survey

When responding to this market survey, please include the following information:

(1)  Detailed description of the potential UAS (platform, payloads, GCS, and control links)

(2)  Completed attached data sheets (Attachment A Worksheets RFI Data Parameters; EO IR Data Sheet and Radar Data Sheets, if applicable)

(3)  List of U.S. (or international) government contracts for products being submitted as applicable

(4)  Any digital photos and/or digital videos of the products in operation

This contract modification will extend the period of performance from 30 November 2008 until 31 July 2009.  Although more than one source may be able to fulfill the requirement, this would create substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through a competition for the short term extension of services.  The SRF-B training will provide Navy personnel the fundamentals of watch standing and the use of weapons.  The SRF-A training will provide personnel assigned to a security reaction force team the training and education for the prevention of threats, whether from the pier, small boat, or any other means form penetrating a unit in accordance with current naval directives under normal and emergency conditions.  The TRASUP training will provide antiterrorism and force protection supervisors with the necessary knowledge and skills to oversee the day-to-day ATFP readiness of the unit, conduct initial and sustainment training for assigned ATFP personnel and function as the unit Navy ATFP tactics, techniques and procedures subject matter experts.  The SAMI training provides Navy personnel the training required to perform duties of a Small Arms Instructor and earn Navy Enlisted Classification 0812. The NLW-BI course graduates will be qualified as basic instructors and be certified to teach Pressure Point Control Techniques (PPCT), Empty Hand Control Techniques (EHCT), Handheld Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) (i.e., pepper spray), batons, and handcuffs (steel/flexi-cuffs).

The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.  FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(A), states services may be deemed to be available only from one responsible source when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  All inquires and concerns must be addressed to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Ayana Graham at ayana.graham@navy.mil or call 407-380-4012.  Responses to this notice must be submitted by 12 November 2008.  A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government.  Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in a future competition.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract to Morningstar Direct.  Morningstar Direct provides Internet access to Morningstar proprietary statistics, stock ratings and peer comparisons, commentary, research reports, buy/sell recommendations and analysis. Morningstar Direct is the only product that offers both holdings- and performance-based analysis in a single research platform across an extensive collection of data that includes not only mutual funds, but other types of investments.  Morningstar Direct is the only vendor capable of delivering the data from the Morningstar databases on the analytical platform that is required by the Commission.  This information is not available from any other source. The period of performance will be for one year, effective December 1, 2008.   The SEC intends to negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1; Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested organizations may submit their capability statements and qualifications for the provision of this requirement, which may or may not be considered by the SEC.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurements.  This is a Notice of Intent, not a solicitation.  No solicitation will be issued for this sole source requirement and no other information will be provided.

<DESC>ONR is interested in receiving proposals for basic scientific research that will forge major advancements in software and systems research.  It will lead to new insights and understanding of software producibility, systems engineering, and trust in cyberspace.  It will address new and emerging challenges for the extended naval information infrastructure, which by 2020 is expected to be a highly mobile, extremely heterogeneous, globally connected, very widely dispersed, partly trusted, federated enterprise environment.

The two basic research areas are broadly defined and address fundamental issues in software, motivated by cyberspace, trust and producibility.

    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting more than 50 percent for at least 80 percent each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

STATEMENT OF WORK -- CONTRACT ROLE PLAYER SERVICES -- ADVANCED ADMISSIBILITY SECONDARY PROCESSING (AASP) -- ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TRAINING PROGRAM (EOTP) 
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection, (CBP) Advanced Training Center, (ATC) Harpers Ferry, West Virginia requires contract role-player services in support of training delivery for course offerings conducted at the Center for a Base year period of December 1, 2008 through November 30, 2009, plus four (4) one year renewal options through November 30, 2013. 
A. SCOPE
1. Role-player services will be provided on a reoccurring basis to multiple classes on a prearranged schedule as supplied by CBP to the contractor. At a minimum role players will be used to support the Advanced Admissibility Secondary Processing (AASP) Course and the Enforcement Officer Training Program (EOTP) conducted during the specified contract period.
2. The AASP course requires up to twelve (12) role-players x eight (8) hours per class. It is estimated that approximately 22 classes will be conducted in a FY = *2,112 est. hours (12 x 8 x 22= 2112). Schedules will be provided to the contractor at least one quarter in advance. The number of hours is subject to change due to National security reprioritizing of CBP mission requirements and may entail discontinuation or reduction in training which may change the number of classes without notice. In the event it is necessary to reprioritize and reduce the number f role players required or cancel a scheduled class, for other than weather or immediate national emergency response, the CBP Contracting Officer Technical Representative shall provide a 48 hour written cancellation notice to the contractor. However, if the cancellation is weather or national emergency response related, a 48 hour notification cannot be guaranteed. 
3. The EOTP course requires up to two (2) role-players x sixteen (16) hours per class. This is estimated at four, 4-hour blocks. It is estimated that there will be up to nine classes in a FY=288 hours. Schedules will be provided to the contractor at least one quarter in advance. In the event it is necessary to reprioritize and reduce the number of role players required or cancel a scheduled class, for other than weather or immediate national emergency response, the CBP Contracting Officer Technical Representative shall provide a 48 hour written cancellation notice to the contractor. However, if the cancellation is weather or national emergency response related, a 48 hour notification cannot be guaranteed. 
Classes for AASP and EOTP are conducted Monday through Friday between the ATC core hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. The specific days and eight or four hour blocks of time the role-players will be needed are dependent upon the overall class schedule start and finish dates. Schedules will be provided one quarter in advance to the contractor, identifying times and dates role-playing services are required. 
B. ROLE PLAYER DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
The role-players for the academic AASP and EOTP classes will perform a variety of roles related to Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as material witnesses and defendants and as individuals making application for entry to the United States.
For AASP and EOTP role-playing, the scripted roles and information made available to role-players during the conduct of the practical exercise is not considered law enforcement sensitive and is consistent with that information made available to the traveling public. 
In the event a role-player is needed for a scenario that is law-enforcement sensitive, prior coordination will be made with the contractor for role-players with previous law-enforcement experience. Physical contact for other than academic role-playing will be no more than handcuffing and physical search. 
Role-players must be U.S. citizens, 18 years of age or older.
Contractor personnel who will report to the ATC and serve as Role-players are required to have completed NATIONAL AGENCY CHECK (NACI) ensuring their suitability for the duties required and access to the Advanced Training Center, a secure facility. The NACI allows the assigned personnel to have unescorted access to the ATC.
6. Prior role-player experience is not required 
Any scripts or external props and resources necessary to conduct the practical exercise will be provided by the ATC.
An appropriate dress code for the role-players will be coordinated between CBP and the contractor. CBP reserves the right to reject a role-player for inappropriate dress, actions or other articulable reasons.
A lead role-player will be assigned to ensure an adequate number of role-players are present. Lead role players will ensure a sign-in and sign-out sheet is utilized and that all role-players remain at the designated practical exercise area until the responsible officer has signed the roster and been afforded the opportunity to provide comments, if any, in the space provided.
A roster of the role-players reporting for each practical exercise shall be provided to the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) for verification and certification of invoices submitted for processing.
11. Abide by Customs and Border Protection, Advanced Training Center guidelines for classroom management, integrity and fraternization.
12. All vendor employees having access to the content of the training, will be asked to sign the Confidentiality Agreement provided by the vendor.
C. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
1. The Contractor must conduct Employment Eligibility Verification by requiring applicants to show their U.S. Passport OR a combination of a valid state drivers license AND an original social security card or birth certification (with seal).
Each role-player assigned to work on and within the scope of this purchase order will be required to satisfactorily complete and pass a NACI with the Office of Personnel Management proof of completed background must be supplied to CBP for verification. CBP reserves the right to conduct their own backgrounds checks (no persons with a felony or misdemeanors in the last 8 years will be allowed access).
Contract employees are required to give, and to authorize others to give, full, frank and truthful answers to relevant and material questions needed to reach a suitability determination. Refusal or failure to furnish or authorize provision of information may constitute grounds for denial or revocation of credentials. 
SCA Wage Determination No.: 2005-3017, Revision No.: 6, Date Of Revision: 05/29/2008 is in effect on this solicitation. Website:  http://www.wdol.gov/wdol/scafiles/std/05-3017.txt. 
1. What is the GS equivalent of the positions (Role Players)?
Answer:  FAR 52.222-42  Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal Hires. Instructor $18.49 per hour
2. Is there is an incumbent contractor? If so, what is the pay used under the contract?
Answer:  Khan & Hill.  The current Purchase Order (PO) was awarded originally for only 6 months (NO Base and Option years) and did not require the Service Contract Act Wage Determination (as this new RFQ does).  Pricing $26.20 per hour.
3.  The SOW, item 2 indicates the AASP course requires 12 role players x 8 hours per class and it is estimated that 22 classes will be conducted in a FY = 1728 hours.  My calculation shows 12 x 8 x 22= 2112 hours.  The EOTP course requirement per fiscal year is 288 hours.  Therefore, if 2112 is the correct calculation for AASP, the total hours should be 2400 hours instead of 2016 hours. Please confirm the correct number of hours for the RFQ.
Answer:  The 1728 hours is incorrect.  Total for this should be an estimated 2,112 hours.  The overall hours to quote is 2,400 estimated hours per year (this is changed in Amendment Solicitation.

9.  Who is responsible for the cost of conducting a NACI for each role player?

16.  If so, and there is a vendor currently providing this hourly labor service, has the hourly labor rate been indexed against the prevailing wage determination and what is that indexed rate?
Answer:  The current PO did not require SCA.  The future (Option years) employee rate is determined by any revised Wage Determinations needing to be incorporated at the time an Option is exercised. 
17.  We suggest that a Manager be included and that some training time is available to assist in performance?

Answer:  See 15090 TECHNICAL INSTRUCTOR for appropriate rate to be used.  Your company has to determine the Option year pricing (note: if a new wage determination is put into effect, the Wage Determination will be incorporated into the Option Year modification (if the Option year is exercised) IAW Far regulation.

The purpose of this notice is to obtain information from qualified small businesses and to conduct market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10 (please see attached market research questions). No solicitation is being issued at this time. This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB), Colorado, seeks potential sources to perform a variety of non-personal Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) and Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) services in support of Headquarters, Air Force Space Command (HQ AFSPC), PAFB, Colorado.

This requirement shall also consist of several phases of planning, programming, acquisition, and implementation cycles of various Government systems to complement the Government?s technical expertise in accomplishing its mission. In rendering the foregoing services, outputs may take the form of information, advice, opinions, alternatives, analyses, evaluations, recommendations, and training services. Work under this contract will require security clearances. For reference purposes, the solicitation, when issued, will be numbered FA2517-08-R-9000 and will be a Request for Proposal (RFP). A best value source selection will likely be the method of contractor selection. Work performed under the current HQ AFSPC contract will be accessible at the Federal Technical Data Solutions (FedTeDS) website. It is anticipated the contract performance period will be a base period of five years with no option periods, and the program?s ceiling value will be approximately $400 million. Most of the work is expected to be performed on PAFB. The Government is contemplating award of a multiple award Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with firm fixed price and cost type contract line item numbers (CLINs). The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences, with a small business size standard of 1,000 employees.

It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents.

<DESC><p>RESPONSES ARE DUE BY 4 PM, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 2008.</p>
<p>Question Period closed on Monday, October 27, 2008</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI)&nbsp;Chemical Biology Consortium&nbsp;(CBC) is being developed to facilitate the discovery and development of new agents to treat patients with cancer. The NCI seeks to coordinate academic and private drug discovery efforts with its own, and thereby expedite the entry of new molecular entities (NME) into oncologic practice. The program is being developed by NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), in conjunction with NCI's Center for Cancer Research (CCR) and the NCI Director's Office, with guidance from external advisory panels. This effort will be managed by the NCI's Experimental Therapeutics (NExT) Program. SAIC-Frederick, Inc. (SAIC-F) is responsible for providing support for the key operational and technical aspects. It is envisioned that this Consortium will provide cutting-edge chemical tools for probing complex biochemical signaling pathways and will serve as the starting point for the elaboration of first-in-class targeted therapies. The long-term vision of the CBC is to bridge the gap between basic scientific findings and NCI-supported clinical research to facilitate the discovery and development of new agents to treat patients with cancer.</p>
<p>The CBC will establish an integrated network of chemical biologists, molecular oncologists, and compound screening centers from government, academia, and eventually from industry. The drug discovery strategy of the CBC is to expand current NCI programs by providing a coordinated focus on therapeutic opportunities in high-risk, under-represented areas, significantly advancing the discovery of novel compounds active against specific molecular and genetic cancer targets. CBC efforts will include recruiting extramural investigators with specialized expertise in novel discovery platforms as well as medicinal chemistry, chemical biology, molecular oncology, and other areas of drug discovery and development. The CBC will be centrally managed to coordinate the selection of targets and screening for agents that interact with these targets, and will then use an iterative development process to design and optimize drug "hits" into "leads." The CBC will benefit from access to the NCI's late-stage drug development resources and expertise.</p>
<p>SAIC-F is seeking technical proposals for Comprehensive Chemical Biology Screening Centers, Chemical Diversity Centers and/or Specialized Applications Centers. Participants are expected to support the progression of candidate molecules through formal milestones/Stage Gate discovery and development criteria established by Chemical Biology Consortium (CBC) leadership in accordance with industry standards.</p>
<p>Participants will have an unparalleled opportunity to participate in a highly collaborative drug discovery partnership with the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Using state-of-the-art communication, data-sharing and project management tools, the CBC will effect a paradigm shift in the use of public-private partnerships to translate knowledge from leading academic institutions into ground-breaking new drug candidates for patients with cancer.</p>
