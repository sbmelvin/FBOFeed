<DESC>Customs and Border Protection, DHS intends to award a order to ViON Corp. against their GSA schedule for Hitachi Data Systems (HDS) Direct Access Storage Device (DASD) for disaster recovery solution.  CBP  has implemented many advanced features available exclusively to HDS.  One of these features is HDS disaster recovery solution (True Copy Asynchronous) used to mirror all storage to a disaster recovery site allowing CBP to recovery from a disaster within hours with no data loss, without this feature CBP would require more than 24 hours to recovery and lose up go 36 hours of data.  Another HDS feature that is required is the Shadow Image feature that allows CBP to make backup copy of a storage volume within seconds.  CBP uses this feature to perform backups.  Without this feature CBP would require outages lasting several hours nightly to perform backups, which would affect national security.  True Copy and Shadow Image are only available within HDS storage.  ViOn is the only value added reseller and authorized service provider of HDS labeled Enterprise products into the Federal Government.  For this reason, CBP will award this task order to ViON Corp.

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. 

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that do not issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.
 

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-05.  The contract shall provide the    (CSPCRPCC) with quantity one (1) system:  The XCaliper System which is A Needs Assessment and a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) engineering solution.  The XCaliper applies Taguchi MethodsTM and Design of ExperimentsTM to design unique, reliable, and meaningful RFID experiments based on variable criteria:  products, product pack configurations, RFID tag types, RFID tag orientations, RFID tag positions, RFID reader types, RFID reader antenna types, and RFID reader antenna positions / angles.  Furthermore, the XCaliper System facilitates the automation of the data capture process via software integration with the specific RFID hardware used in the experiment.   The XCaliper system will be used to guarantee with Six Sigma reliability that the specified RFID tags will perform as expected on the specific products in the specified locations on the specific pack configurations utilized by the CSPCRPCC.  The XCaliper System will also assist in the process of integrating RFID into existing production lines and technical systems.  The Xterprise Solutions is the sole manufacturer and provider of the XCaliper System and also holds the patent on the system.

This is considered to be sole source because of the patented process described above.  It has been determined that this system is the only one on the market that meets this facility’s vital needs.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for one HP-200 Hydrogen Purifier to replace a previously purchased hydrogen purifier module manufactured by Johnson Matthey.  NASA/GRC intends to purchase the item from Johnson Matthey as it is a replacement to the previously used part and said item is a critical component of a Government owned crystal growth system that utilizes pure hydrogen and was specifically tailored to operate within it.   Therefore, due to the physical size and complexity of the electrical and physical connections the replacement purifier must be identical to the purifier that is currently installed.  Use of any other type of hydrogen purifier would require substantial modification of the Government owned crystal growth system, and require significant testing of the system to ascertain its reliability and safety.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures set forth in FAR Part 13. Organizations that believe they are capable of performing the described work may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Friday, September 16, 2005. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and Subpart 13.106 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a total small business set-aside.  Request for quotation number RFQ-DC-05-00439 shall be referenced on any quotation.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect thru Federal  Acquisition Circular 2005-05.  The NAICS and small business size standard for this project are 541620/$6.0 million.  Only one award will result from this solicitation, via the issuance of a time-and-materials purchase order.  STATEMENT OF WORK-Electricity Policy Analysis.  I.  BACKGROUND.  There  are significant cost-effective opportunities to reduce emissions from the electricity sector.  Some opportunities arise from improving the efficiency of electricity use and supply, while others involve replacing carbon-intensive fuels with less-carbon-intensive fuels to generate energy.  EPA's  Climate Protection Partnership Division and Energy STAR program exists to promote these opportunities, but continues to experience disincentives and other barriers in the electricity policy arena as the program seeks to increase energy efficiency.  End-use energy efficiency opportunities are  widespread with residential, commercial and industrial customers.  On the supply side, a particularly cost-effective example of a clean, efficient distributed generation technology is combined heat & power (CHP).  CHP offers power reliability and load distribution benefits to the already overtaxed  U.S. power grid.  Another group of technologies that offer promising emissions reduction benefits over conventional power technologies are renewable energy technologies.  While offering substantial emissions reductions and economic benefits, these technologies have not been implemented on a wide  scale in the U.S. because of financial, informational, and institutional barriers.  A major part of this requirement deals with assessing the opportunities for addressing regulatory and informational barriers, and undertaking program activities to overcome the identified barriers. II.  OBJECTIVES.   The objective of this statement of work is to provide technical support to the Climate Protection Partnerships Division in conducting research, financial and technical analysis and outreach on effective business cases for cost-effective utility investment in energy efficiency (EE) and clean  distributed generation (DG) as a strategy to lower natural gas prices, increase system reliability, and mitigate the environmental impacts of energy.   This statement of work will involve implementing support for, among other things, a new effort called the National Action Plan for Energy  Efficiency which will bring together leaders from the utility industry, state and federal agencies, and other stakeholders to develop solutions that increase support for EE and clean DG.  A description of the National Action Plan is attached to this SOW as Attachment A for additional background.   III.  SCOPE.  This statement of work involves two Tasks: (1) facilitating communication between the COR and the contractor by conducting kick-off and other regular meetings; and (2) conducting research and developing business case reports or other outreach products to demonstrate the  cost-effectiveness of EE and clean DG investment strategies to utilities and regulators.   Task 1.  Communication.  The contractor shall attend a kick-off meeting by phone with the COR and other experts at EPA.  In addition to the kick-off meeting, the contractor should plan on monthly status calls  with the COR to provide updates on research and analyses, as well as budget and other issues as they arise. Task 1.	Schedule of Deliverables.  Deliverable - Kick-off Meeting, deadline - within 2 weeks of contract award.  Deliverable - Monthly status meeting, deadline - the first week of each month  thereafter. Task 2.	 Research and Development of Business Case Reports for EE and Clean DG Investments.  Energy efficiency and clean DG have been shown to increase system reliability, reduce peak power demand, reduce consumer energy bills, and reduce environmental impacts.  However, despite these  proven benefits, a significant amount of cost-effective EE and clean DG investments exist.  This is due in part to a lack of documented information about these benefits, as well as a lack of widespread valuation and measurement techniques.  Another key barrier is that typical utility incentive  structures reward utilities for maximizing their sales-thereby creating a disincentive to EE and DG.  Under this task, the contractor will receive direction from the EPA COR to complete quick-turnaround research and analysis requests.  The product of these requests may be used to support planning  of business cases developed for National Action Plan for Energy Efficiency.  This may include, but is not limited to, filling research requests on energy efficiency best practices and reviewing or preparing text for scoping papers.  For budgeting purposes, the contractor should expect up to four  (4) research requests of this nature.  This task will also involve receiving direction from the EPA COR and the National Action Plan Leadership Group in scoping out and developing a series of up to four (4) business cases that pull together state-of-the-art information that documents the costs,  benefits, and other issues surrounding EE and clean DG investments. Upon request from the COR, the contractor shall perform technical analysis of the actual or potential impact of a specific policy or program that has been proposed or is already being implemented.   This may include, but is not  limited to, studying electricity grid effects, including reduction in peak demand, reduction in grid congestion, effects on grid reliability, and/or effects on overall electricity cost to consumers.  The audience for this analysis is mainly regulators and utilities, but will include other  stakeholders.  These analyses may involve independently collecting data, but may also involve working with state and regional partners to analyze existing data and survey existing programs. 	Upon receiving notification from the COR, along with additional background information about the specific  analysis, the contractor shall develop a brief write-up that discusses the proposed approach to conduct the analysis.  After COR review and approval of the approach, the contractor shall conduct the research and develop a report that discusses the results of the research, including lessons learned  and recommendations for next steps.  These business case reports will be subject to expert review, and will likely be revised before finalizing these documents.  Task 2. Schedule of Deliverables.  Deliverable - Specific analysis/research tasks, deadline - on an as-needed basis, after receiving  direction from the COR.  Deliverable - First draft business case report, deadline - one month after kick-off meeting.  Deliverable - final report, deadline - one week after receiving EPA and National Action Plan comments.  Deliverable - Additional research/updates to report, deadline - upon request  from the COR.   The Contractor shall begin work on the additional business case reports upon receipt of technical direction from the EPA COR.  Final report deliverables for the additional business cases are to be completed at a deadline to be determined which will be within one year from  kick-off meeting.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Date of award through one year.  BASIS FOR AWARD:  The Government will make award to the responsive, responsible firm, whose quotation is most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract to Bauer, Inc., 175 Century Drive, Bristol, CT, to purchase one (1) Automatic Torquing System (Model No. 8731), one (1) Wheel Build-Up Stand (Model No. 8071), one (1) C-17 Main Wheel Adapter (Model No. BEI3840-148-P1), and one (1) C-17 Nose Wheel Adapter (Model No. BEI3840-161-P1) under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Estimated award amount is $142,200.00.

The sole source award is based on the following reasons:

The Bauer Automatic Wheel Torquing System performs bolt tightening (with an accurancy of 1% full scale) according to both torque and snug angle procedures.  Accommodates aircraft wheels with even or odd number of bolts with bolt diameters from 8 in. to 25 in.  The integral PC has storage capacity for more than 100 aircraft wheel configurations--including pre-torque, final torque and torque angle values for each wheel.  The adaptors are required to support the wheels on C-17 aircrafts.

Extensive market research was conducted on the automatic wheel torquing system.  Market research revealed that Bauer Automatic Wheel Torquing System is the only system that meets the specification of the wheel and aircraft manufacturers of the C-17.  It is also the only complete computerized torquing system manufactured for use on the C-17.

<DESC>The Department of State's National Foreign Affairs Training Center, Foreign Service Institute (FSI) provides training and professional development to personnel of the Department of State and the Foreign Service community.  The Transition Center (TC) division of FSI offers security awareness training to foreign affairs agency personnel and their eligible family members in the form of the Security Overseas Seminar (SOS) program. The SOS program currently requires the services of a qualified and experienced contractor(s) to conduct twenty-six (26) presentations on personal security in an overseas environment at each of the seminars.

The overall aim of the SOS training is to motivate individuals to identify the likely security risks overseas and to develop a plan for dealing with them.  The presentations addressing personal security will be provided in direct support of the SOS program. Over two thousand participants per year attend these trainings.  Classes range from 30 to 200 participants with average class sizes being around 100.  Participants come from many U. S. Government agencies.  Their level of experience in the Foreign Service varies from newcomers in the overseas environment to veterans with twenty years or more of service and their family members.  This variance has proved to be both a benefit and a challenge.  Newcomers appreciate the firsthand experiences related by veterans.  However, it has been important that presenters be mindful to avoid elementary approaches that could bore those with more experience.  It has always been important to acknowledge individual experiences the audience members bring to the seminar and to provide some measure of audience participation. The two-day SOS program is offered twenty-six (26) times a year, and presents a variety of presentation formats in order to maximize the efficiency of the program.    

The Personal Security Presentation itself has been developed by TC/T.  The awardee(s) will be responsible for the refinement, update, and delivery of the existing model.  The presentation entitled, “Managing Your Personal Security”, will contain, but will not be limited to the following topics: 

·The role of the Regional Security Officer;
·Bureau of Diplomatic Security Initiatives;
·Overview of current criminal trends and applicable deterrence;

The selected contractor(s) must perform the services listed in this section under the general guidelines established by the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR).  During the agreement periods the contractor(s) shall be responsible for the following:

·Preparation and use of top-quality visual aids compatible with the Foreign Service Institute’s audio-visual technology.  Handouts may be provided by awardee if desired, subject to the approval of the course coordinator.
·Subject matter input toward course materials for the personal security portion of Security Overseas Seminar Guidebook.
·Awardee(s) will be required to attend an orientation meeting with the Contracting Office Representative (COR) and other staff members.
·Awardee(s) will be required to submit an electronic copy of the PowerPoint file (if used) and presentation notes to course coordinator for the files.
·The awardee(s) must arrive 10 minutes prior to the start of each class and respond to follow-up questions at the end of the sessions.  

The solicitation document for this requirement shall be made available for review (via FEDBIZOPPS.GOV) by September 19, 2005.

Please submit all questions and inquiries to Bernard Salter Jr. in writing at salterb@state.gov by September 22, 2005.

The Transition Center (TC) division  of FSI offers security awareness training to foreign affairs agency personnel and their eligible family members in the form of the Advanced Security Overseas Seminar (ASOS) program. The ASOS program requires the services of a qualified and experienced contractor to conduct fourteen 45-minute presentations addressing personal security in an overseas environment at each of the seminars.

The one-day ASOS program is offered fourteen (14) times a year, and presents a variety of presentation formats in order to maximize the efficiency of the program.

A prerequisite for the program is that the participants must have either attended the two-day Security Overseas Seminar or served no less than five years overseas with their current agency.  Security information in this advanced course must be relevant and current; the personal security consultant must stay abreast of current security events, both on a national and international level, and relate these to security efforts within the foreign affairs community.

The role of the Regional Security Officer and initiatives of the Department of State and Diplomatic Security, both at post and within the Department, will be reviewed in each presentation.  An interactive format that will utilize the experience of veteran course participants is desired.

<DESC>The Department of State's National Foreign Affairs Training Center, Foreign Service Institute (FSI) provides training and professional development to personnel of the Department of State and the Foreign Service community.  The Transition Center (TC) division of FSI offers security awareness training to foreign affairs agency personnel and their eligible family members in the form of the Security Overseas Seminar (SOS) program. The SOS program currently requires the services of a qualified and experienced contractor(s) to conduct twenty-six, fifty-minute presentations on crisis management in an overseas environment at each of the seminars.

The overall aim of the SOS training is to motivate individuals to identify the likely security risks overseas and to develop a plan for dealing with them.  The presentations addressing personal security will be provided in direct support of the SOS program. Over two thousand participants per year attend these trainings.  Classes range from 30 to 200 participants with average class sizes being around 100.  Participants come from many U. S. Government agencies.  Their level of experience in the Foreign Service varies from newcomers in the overseas environment to veterans with twenty years or more of service and their family members.  This variance has proved to be both a benefit and a challenge.  Newcomers appreciate the firsthand experiences related by veterans.  However, it has been important that presenters be mindful to avoid elementary approaches that could bore those with more experience.  It has always been important to acknowledge individual experiences the audience members bring to the seminar and to provide some measure of audience participation. The two-day SOS program is offered twenty-six (26) times a year, and presents a variety of presentation formats in order to maximize the efficiency of the program.    

The fifty minute presentation entitled, “Managing in a Crisis,” is an introduction to how to cope with disasters ranging from natural ones such as floods to terrorist ones like the recent bombing in London. The presentation itself has been developed by TC/T.  The awardee(s) will be responsible for the refinement, update, and delivery of the existing model.  The presentation will include, but will not be limited to the following topics: 

·Experiences of individuals who have served overseas; 
·The relationship of crisis management to the other security and safety presentations of the program; 
·Listing and explaining the stages of crises; 
·Community preparation and crisis management initiatives (both at post and within the Department);

The selected contractor(s) must perform the services listed in this section under the general guidelines established by the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR).  During the agreement periods the contractor(s) shall be responsible for the following:

·Preparation and use of top-quality visual aids compatible with the Foreign Service Institute’s audio-visual technology.  Handouts may be provided by awardee if desired, subject to the approval of the course coordinator.
·Subject matter input toward course materials for the personal security portion of Security Overseas Seminar Guidebook.
·Awardee(s) will be required to attend an orientation meeting with the Contracting Office Representative (COR) and other staff members.
·Awardee(s) will be required to submit an electronic copy of the PowerPoint file (if used) and presentation notes to course coordinator for the files.
·The awardee(s) must arrive 10 minutes prior to the start of each class and respond to follow-up questions at the end of the sessions.  

The solicitation document for this requirement shall be made available for review (via FEDBIZOPPS.GOV) by September 19, 2005.

<DESC>The Government intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Cryonix, Inc of 12401 Washington Avenue, Rockville, MD 20852 for the support for the Department of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR), currently located at 11800 Tech Road, Silver Spring, MD.  The requiring activity is the Army Medical Surveillance Activity (AMSA), U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventative Medicine (USACHPPM).  The DoDSR retains serum test specimens of military personnnel for baseline purposes and resea rch studies.  The DoDSR consists of office space, 15 large walk-in freezers (approximately 30' x 30' x 10' in size), and a small laboratory.  The incumbent provides personnel to perform the operation of the DoDSR, including specimen processing, laboratory operations, data entry, general repository operations, transporation of specimens, and equipment maintenance. Due to space limitations in the current facility in Silver Spring, the DoDSR is  contemplating a relocation to Fort Meade, MD within a period of 12 months.

Qualification Requirements:
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined the Government to be similar in complexity and criticality, can be considered approved sources for this item.  Current qualified sources are:  Crane Co. Cage Code: 081982.  Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  All proposals received within 45 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A Determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation.
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government. 
Based on market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government’s requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD plans to award a sole source small purchase order to AGFA Corporation,  Melbourne, FL for eleven boxes (packaged 42 rolls per box) of EQT1K00 16 mm x 250’ Chrome 200 Range Film.  AGFA is the sole manufacturer of the required film that is compatible with existing cameras and will satisfy the Government’s minimum requirement for the intended use. The mandatory requirements for the film are as follows:  the film must have an estar base which by design is tough, very hard to tear or break, does not become brittle when subjected to cold temperature and will withstand the force applied to the film when the high speed cameras are operated at a frame rate of 500 frames per second,  the film must have sprocket holes on both sides of the film with .3000-inch pitch.  The required film will be used in cameras that are mounted externally on the aircraft and become subjected to extremely cold temperatures, thus requiring the estar base film.  The standard base film is acetate, which becomes very brittle and breaks easily when subjected to cold temperatures making it completely unsatisfactory for high frame rate operation and cold environment.   These mandatory requirements must be met in order for the film to be compatible with existing cameras.  The Government reserves the right to process this procurement on a Sole Source basis.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  This notice of intent closes 9-16-05.

<DESC>The Government intends to purchase services to assist The Navy Environmental Health Center to understand the health effects for emerging chemicals.  The Navy Environmental Health Center is continuously tasked with responding to issues involving materials of evolving regulatory interest (MERIT).  DoD has been working along side EPA, and other agencies and stakeholders. As they are identified, Navy needs to ensure that research needs and approaches for addressing health concerns are conducted in an environmentally sound manner and meet or are better than existing regulatory requirements.  In some cases, current information regarding toxicology and fate and transport is very limited or nonexistent.

MERIT chemicals may include polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perchlorate, nitrosamines, chlorinated pesticides and munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) and/or their potential environmental break down products.  MEC include ingredients in solid propellant mixtures used for rockets, missiles, and munitions, various caliber, exploding and unexploded (potentially discarded) ordnance, smoke and pyrotechnics, test kits, particulates, energetic materials, carbonyls/ aldehydes, dioxins and furans, various gases (for example, hydrogen cyanide, carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, etc.), chemical agents (such as GB, VX, and mustard gas), explosives, heavy metals, such as tungsten, depleted uranium, and lead, ammonium picrate, nitroglycerine, nitrocellulose, HMX, RDX, TNT, black powder, ammonium nitrate fuel oil, etc.

Tasks

The support includes but is not limited to:
·	Conduct rigorous scientific research/review of the literature and other information to identify specific toxicological data needed to make a scientifically sound determination and provide timely and accurate comments.  The literature review should include USEPA and California EPA sources because they may have already evaluated the chemical and developed regulatory applicable reference doses or cancer slope factors.  The literature review should also include the general toxicological scientific literature; 
·	Prepare and provide toxicity profiles to NEHC for chemicals that NEHC identifies.  The toxicity profiles generally should not be longer than 3 pages and should focus on the topics identified in the outline below as information is available, including:
o	Assess the scientific validity of available data, data needs and data gaps
o	Verify that the key studies underlying the health assessment are of the quality, reliability, and relevance required drawing conclusions about the health implications of exposure to low levels of specific chemical in drinking water.
o	Interpret and summarize the key toxicology issues and help determine the validity of the scientific findings presented.
o	Identify populations at risk of increased susceptibility/disease outcomes.
o	Derive toxicity values for these MERIT and/or U.S. EPA proposed UCMR2 new list of chemicals.  
o	Prepare a chart of appropriate toxicity values for each chemical;
·	Prepare briefing materials, Power Point slides, and handouts to present in support of technical meetings; 
·	Determine whether to recommend that the Navy agree or disagree with the Federal, EPA Regional, and/or State regulators toxicology conclusions and outline the reasons.  
·	Provide specific toxicity information, as applicable, for each chemical concerning the disruption of function in humans and animals at various stages of life.  These efforts may help to prevent regulatory bodies from issuing overly conservative drinking water maximum contaminant level (MCL) that would create an unjustified heightened sense of concern in the public and needlessly waste tax payers money in cleanup costs.
·	Review the toxicological and epidemiological research, health studies, and regulatory initiatives that will impact Navy sites
·	Review available body burden data and determine appropriate toxicity values to use for indoor air/VI pathways for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in calculating the human health risk
·	Participate in conference calls with NEHC and other parties to discuss toxicological or other information that may issues involved in the evaluation of VI sites.
·	Revise the toxicity profiles based on NEHC input and finalize.  
·	Provide NEHC (if requested) with a copy of all pertinent scientific papers and information.  

TOXICOLOGICAL PROFILES CONCEPTUAL OUTLINE
·	Chemical and Physical Information Relevant to Human Health Risk Assessments
·	Toxicokinetics relevant to Human Health Risk Assessments such as Gastrointestinal, Respiratory Tract, and dermal absorption.
·	Hazard Identification 
o	Studies in Humans – Epidemiology and Case Reports for oral, inhalation and dermal exposure.
o	Subchronic and Chronic Studies and Cancer Bioassays in Animals
o	Reproductive/Developmental Studies
o	Other Studies 
o	Weight-of-evidence Evaluation and Cancer Characterization

Introduction and Overview: The functions of the Food for Peace Program are outlined in USAID's Automated Directives System; formerly USAID Handbook 17, while policy, process and procedures are outlined in USAID's Handbook 9, 22 CFR 211, Reg 11, and annual guidance issued by DCHA FFP.  The USAID Uganda Senior Food for Peace Officer is an integral member of the SO7 Team. He or she is the principal staff person at USAID Uganda responsible for the coordination and management of the Mission’s PL-480 Title II Program.  The P.L. 480 Title II Program has two components: 1. the Non-emergency Program, which was valued at approximately 19 million Dollars in FY 05; and 2. the Emergency Program, which has grown substantially as a result of the crisis in northern Uganda and was nearly 55 million Dollars in FY05.  In addition, the Senior Food for Peace Officer is responsible for oversight of the USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance program in Uganda.  Under this program, the OFDA provided 11.9 million Dollars of humanitarian relief assistance to Uganda in FY05.  The Senior Food for Peace Officer performs representational, policy advisory, technical leadership, and program management roles.  As a senior development professional, he or she is responsible for providing technical guidance and policy advice to USAID senior management and the U.S. Ambassador to Uganda.  He or she is also responsible for ensuring that USAID and Embassy senior staff and host country counterpart officials, to include the Ministerial level,  are informed of the U.S. food aid program as a whole, as well as the current situation vis-à-vis the humanitarian crisis in the north.  He or she is also responsible for ensuring that senior USAID Washington officials, including at the Assistant Administrator level, are well informed of the humanitarian and food security situation on-the-ground in Uganda.  The Senior Food for Peace Officer is also responsible for building strong and constructive relationships with other donors, the World Food Program, and the senior staff of U.S. Private Voluntary Organizations and Ugandan Non-Governmental Organizations.  The Senior Food for Peace Officer is also responsible for maintaining strong and supportive relationships with the USAID technical offices in Washington, i.e., the Office of Food for Peace and the OFDA, as well as in the Regional Economic Development Support Office in Nairobi.  The Senior Food for Peace officer is also responsible for maintaining close working relationships with his or her counterparts in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  As a senior technical advisor, the Senior Food for Peace Officer is responsible for ensuring that the food aid program in Uganda reflects best practices and state-of-the-art knowledge about food aid policies and approaches, including food distribution, monetization, and humanitarian assistance.  He or she will also play a key role for the USAID Mission and the Embassy in monitoring the humanitarian crisis in northern Uganda and ensuring that policy makers in Washington have the accurate information they need to make Agency-level resource allocation decisions.  Other specifics. 1.  The Non-Emergency Program consists of five multi-year Development Assistance Programs DAPS and involves both direct food distribution and the monetization of food aid.  The Title II Cooperating Sponsors are: ACDI VOCA, 54 million Dollars over 5 years; Africare, 6 million Dollars; Catholic Relief Services, 9 million Dollars, World Vision, 10 million Dollars, and Save the Children, approximately 15 million Dollars. Approximately 10 million Dollars in local currency is generated annually through the Title II monetization consortium in which all the Title II non-Emergency partners participate.  Funds generated through commodity monetization are provided to all cooperating sponsors based upon their approved commodity tonnage percentage.  Title II resources are used in the support of agricultural food security programming, HIV AIDS feeding, improved feeder roads, rural financial services, and improved household nutrition.  2. USAID’s partner in the implementation of the Title II Emergency program is the World Food Program.  USAID is WFP’s most important donor in Uganda, providing 50 percent of the resources implemented by WFP.  Title II emergency resources are directed at IDPs, refugees, and drought affected and other vulnerable populations. 3. OFDA humanitarian relief assistance is currently channeled through 16 partners, 13 of which are NGOs and three of which are UN agencies i.e., FAO, UNICEF, and OCHA - the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.  The sectoral areas of coverage for OFDA funding include water and sanitation, health and nutrition, shelter, and the distribution of basic non food commodities to conflict affected populations.   The OFDA funded NGOs work throughout northern Uganda. 4. The Senior Food for Peace Officer will also provide oversight to selected activities carried out in northern Uganda using USAID Uganda resources.  One such program has been the Rural Economy and Agriculture Project, REAP, a two-year 1.1 million Dollar effort being undertaken by ACDI VOCA in Gulu District. 5. Reporting Requirements.  The Senior Food for Peace Officer reports to the SO7 Team Leader; an FS 01 General Development Officer, who in turn reports to the Deputy Director of USAID Uganda.  For detailed scope of work including overall duties and responsibilities and evaluation criteria, please send email to gnakaddu@usaid.gov, copy rheller@usaid.gov.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from qualified small business firms under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541611 ($5 million) which have the capability to carry out an investigation of public perceptions regarding limits to health care spending and approaches to allocating resources, using a method that will inform/educate participants as well as eliciting their views.  Potential approaches include but are not limited to deliberative focus groups, deliberative polls, and citizens’ juries.  The firm must be able to identify and secure a relevant population-based sample or groups of laypersons for this project, and it must be able to propose and justify how the method chosen for obtaining public input will advance the development of practical mechanisms for obtaining this type of input for ongoing and future policy decisions.  This project will address the conventional wisdom that the American public is unwilling to consider “rationing” or to admit to the necessity of making choices among competing uses of health care funds, an assumption that is frequently referenced as a basis for justifying policy related to decision making as well as specific choices in health care.  The project will re-examine these assumptions and specifically investigate the willingness and ability of the public to use economic information, including cost-effectiveness analysis, to set priorities and make choices about spending on health care services.  

Sources must have an understanding of and experience in all aspects of running deliberative focus groups or other methods of elicitation that involve informing/educating participants as well as eliciting their views.  They must be able to demonstrate their ability and creativity in identifying participants from diverse backgrounds and geographic locations and in instrument development.  Sources must also document a successful track record of running large projects in a timely and efficient manner.  Staff must include a Project Director who shall have, at a minimum, a Doctoral degree in a health and human services-related specialty and not less than 15 years work experience including at least 5 years focusing on efforts specifically relevant to this project.  Other staff must include mid or senior level professionals with experience in all aspects of survey research, qualitative research methods, and deliberative methodology as relevant to the proposal submitted.  

Interested small businesses should submit their capability statements (no more than 10 pages in length) to Gayle McClelland, Contract Specialist, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Division of Contracts Management, 500 Gaither Rd, Rockville, Maryland 20850, no later than 2:00pm eastern standard time, on October 3, 2005 .  Capability statements should be tailored to this request and identify the source’s capabilities to complete this requirement, including information on key staff experience and education, and a description of corporate experience with similar projects.  Capability statements should be submitted in an original and two (2) copies.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Landing Gear Commodity Council Prime Vendor Contract
<DESC>Landing Gear PrimeVendor Contract (LGPVC) request for information.  The Landing Gear Commodity Council (84 MSUG/OBL), heretofore referred to as “LGCC”, is revisiting the pricing arrangement for this proposed effort to consider replacing the previously announced “Prospective Redetermination Provision” with an EPA provision.  LGCC requests input from Industry with regard to the following approach:  
Interested parties shall review the Industry Day Papers and other information regarding the Landing Gear Commodity Council, available at:  http://www.hill.af.mil/lg2/LandingGear/index.htm  
     RFI submissions shall address:  1. Support for or against the change from a Prospective pricing approach to an EPA provision  2. a) If an EPA provision is proposed as more appropriate, request information with regard to indices – which one(s) are applicable for LGPVC?  Both labor and material indices are to be included in the alternative EPA provision being considered.   b) Included in support for an EPA, request opinion regarding a potential “composite index” – would a composite approach be more appropriate –representing a variety of metals, common to specific landing gear items?  c)  What other stipulations, other than are outlined in this RFI, would be appropriate?  d) Should the LGCC replace the provision for a “prospective approach” with the one outlined herein?  Why or why not?
Responses are due by 5:00 p.m. Mountain Standard Time, 15 SEP 05. 

PROPOSED (DRAFT) EPA PROVISION:  
In anticipation of establishing a prime-vendor contract for landing gear parts, the landing gear commodities council recognized the challenge in establishing reasonable pricing for a ten year period at the outset of the contract. Although contractors are only asked to initially propose ceiling prices for years two through ten, we recognize that unusually high increases in raw material costs such as steel, aluminum or titanium are always possible which could render the ceiling prices too low and place the contractor in a loss position. This would be undesirable for both contracting parties. 

Initially the government devised a plan to solve this problem by including a provision in the contract that would allow contractors to increase their previously established ceiling prices if they could provide data indicating that raw materials were exceeding anticipated levels. However, it has been indicated to us that conditions for an EPA provision may be more favorable than the council originally concluded. In light of this, and in the interest of employing the most suitable pricing methodology,  the commodity council is considering the following alternative. 

Rather than requiring any cost data from the prime vendor to support unusual price increases, we are considering calculating economic ceilings that might exceed a contractors proposed ceiling prices and allow the contractor to increase his firm unit prices to our economic ceilings in the event that they exceed his previously established ceiling prices.

The government would calculate its economic ceilings by applying a pre-selected indices to the proposed base year unit price of a contractor. The government is considering selecting a pool of perhaps five material indices and one labor index to use in generating its economic ceilings for each contractor. Then one selected material index and the one labor index would be applied to calculate the government economic ceiling for each item. The pool of material indices the government would employ might include one for steel, titanium, aluminum, and so forth. The government is also considering using one composite index for material that is based upon the average mix of metals in a sample of major landing gear components. In order to make this economic calculation possible, the government would require contractors to supply the mix of labor and material that comprises the unit price for each item, i.e. Part No. 17H52-A is 45% material and 55% labor (with the associated indirect costs and profit applied).

For example, let’s suppose that a contractor proposed a base year price of $2,000 for an item and a ceiling price of $2,060 for year 2. Then let’s suppose that a major component of the item is steel which rises 15% that year. If steel had been the pre-determined major component of the bill of materials for that item, and the item had been price had been determined to be comprised of 60% material and 40% labor, the government would calculate and economic ceiling price for the item as follows:

Base year price              $2,000
    Material portion:       $ 1,200   *   1.15  (steel index)   =   $1,350
    Labor portion:           $    800   *    1.03 (labor index)  =         824
Government Calculated Economic Ceiling                           $ 2,174

Hence, for this part, the contractor would be allowed to increase his ceiling price to $2,174 if he chose to do so rather than his previously proposed ceiling of $2,060. A great advantage to this approach is that contractors would not be required to submit any data to support an increase to a ceiling price as would have been the case under the previous scenario.

To simplify this process, it is anticipated that we would only apply this methodology to the high-priced items that represent 85% of the historical spend and also the forecast (many of these items overlap).  This would mean that the pricing of approximately 100-150 of the total approximate 1500 items would be impacted by this provision.

<SUBJECT>R -- A-76 CA Study for Docket Clerk Legal Support Services for US DOL, Office of Adminstrative Law Judges and Adjudicatory Boards
<DESC>FORMAL NOTICE OF A76 COMPETITIVE SOURCING STUDY. This notice constitutes the formal announcement and commencement of the A-76 cost comparison study for the Office of Administrative Law Judges and Adjudicatory Boards A-76 Streamlined CA Study on 9/12/2005, under the newly revised OMB Circular A-76, dated 29 May 2003.  This study is expected to be completed on or earlier than December 12, 2005 at which time a formal decision shall be rendered.  However, the Competitive Sourcing Official has granted an extension of 45 additional days if deemed necessary for completion. These services are located at Department of Labor offices, provided by employees of the following organizations: Administrative Review Board (ARB), Employees’ Compensation Appeals Board (ECAB), Benefits Review Board (BRB), Office of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ), and are performed by thirty-two (32 FTE) personnel.  The start date is 9/12/2005, until concluded under the Streamlined Competition Process that will include an MEO. The purpose of this Streamlined w/MEO A-76 study is to determine whether it is less expensive for industry or the Government to continue to perform the operation as-is, as prescribed in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, "Performance of Commercial Activities", which sets forth the general policy of the Government to achieve economy and enhance productivity. The circular requires Federal agencies to review their commercial activities (CA) functions under several methods to determine whether it would be more economical to continue operating them in-house (i.e., with Government employees) or under contract with commercial sources. The method chosen by the Department of Labor for Administrative Legal Support Services is a Streamlined w/MEO study.  Reviews shall be conducted in accordance with Circular A-76. This synopsis serves to publish not only the official start date in FEDBIZOPPS at www.eps.gov., but to provide essential information about the study and the potential opportunity to contract for the requirement.  The Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO) is Mr. Patrick Pizzella, the Agency Tender Official is Mr. Frank Clubb, and the Contracting Officer/SSA is Mr. Peter Higginbotham.  The cost comparison process is as follows:  in accordance with the A-76 Circular, and Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Contracting Officer will analyze market pricing information against the Government’s MEO estimate to perform the function and make a final decision.  If it appears that market analyses are properly supported, showing substantive proof that the private/commercial pricing is more cost effective than the government’s, a decision may be made to issue a formal RFP and ultimately go contract.  A formal cost proposal is not currently being sought from industry.  If the government MEO estimate is more cost effective a decision shall be rendered to retain the function in-house. This will be the only announcement made for this effort.  Any comments should be directed solely to the Director of Competitive Sourcing, Mr. Larry Clark at Clark.Larry@dol.gov.

<SUBJECT>99 -- FPI - Two New Categories for Commercial Market Services
<DESC>In furtherance of the Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) Board of Directors’ directive to seek and pursue the creation of inmate jobs without mandatory source, this notice announces the intent of the FPI Board to approve two additional types of services which FPI will perform outside the Federal market.  

In September of 1998, FPI received approval from its Board of Directors and legal concurrence from the U.S. Department of Justice to provide commercial market services (CMS) in four specific service areas.  The areas include: 1) work that is currently being performed outside the United States; 2) services with a recognized labor shortage that causes companies to outsource work to foreign countries; 3) new services that a company otherwise intends to contract outside the United States; and 4) services that were performed by non-Federal Bureau of Prisons inmates (such as District of Columbia inmates) for non-Federal agencies. 

On August 25, 2005, FPI requested for the Board to approve two additional categories in the area of commercial market services:  5) service work for state and local governments and 6) service work that would be economically unfeasible to perform without the availability of inmate labor.  The approval of the two new  categories is contingent on public review.  As with other FPI CMS projects, there will be no displacement of United States workers in either category as a result of FPI’s work nor will any potential partnership hinder the development of the domestic market.  

In the case of service work to state and local governments, FPI does not anticipate a great amount of work from this category, but would like to be available to assist state and local agencies if they express an interest in having FPI address their service needs.  FPI will be working closely with its counterparts in state correctional industries programs and with the National Correctional Industries Association, to ensure that the interests of the state programs are protected.  

For service work that is economically unfeasible without the availability of inmate labor, this type of service work is not currently being, or likely to be, performed because it is not economically feasible in the commercial marketplace.  An example of this work would be for FPI to provide a variety of labor-intensive cleaning, repair, and repackaging services for a broad array of consumer goods which have been returned by customers.  Ordinarily, it is too expensive to return the items to new condition, and associated costs make having the work done outside the United States economically impractical.  Currently, these consumer goods are being disposed of by throwing them away, donating them to charitable organizations, or selling them through outlet stores. 

Interested parties are invited to comment on this notice.  Comments will be due within 45 days of the date of publication in the FedBizOpps.  All comments received in response to this announcement will be provided to FPI’s Board of Directors in their entirety.  These comments will be reviewed by the Board prior to making a final decision to proceed, adding the two new categories of CMS as outlined herein.  

Comments or other correspondence should be addressed to:  Chief Administrative Officer, Research, Activation, and Corporate Support, Federal Prison Industries, Inc., 320 First Street, NW, Washington, D.C.  20534.  Attention:  FPI Board of Directors.  Interested parties have a right to raise questions at any time with FPI’s Board of Directors.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subparts 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals/quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

Factory Startup Services:

An authorized technician shall perform the factory start-up service.

Authorized technicians are fully trained on the customer’s equipment and are equipped with the proper test and diagnostic equipment.

Should any problems be detected with the equipment during startup the factory technician will take corrective action to repair the affected components.  

The factory technician will carry spare parts for the specific system at the customer’s jobsite. 

Start-up services included:

1.	System Integrity Check – the journey for UPS starts at the loading dock and ends at the customer’s jobsite where it will be installed.  In between, you have truckers moving it, roads bouncing it, movers positioning it, and contractors working in and around it.  Supplier will take every precaution at the factory to ensure that the system is packaged securely.  However, due to these uncontrollable forces, it is imperative that the system be checked at the onsite to ensure the integrity of the system, that no internal connections or wires have jostled loose and that all the components are properly secured physically and electrically.

2.  Installation check – after the system integrity check, the factory technician will verify that the installation meets all applicable performance and safety codes, including NEC, NFPA, IEEE, and UL.

3.  Preload system check – after the system installation has been verified, the factory technician will commence a preload test of the system.  The preload test will verify proper performance of all system parameters under no-load or dummy load conditions.  Dummy load tests must be prearranged with the factory.

4.  Site load check after the system has been tested and calibrated under no load or dummy load conditions; the customer’s critical equipment is energized through the maintenance bypass (if available). The full operating current of the customer’s equipment is checked and verified not to exceed the rating of the UPS.

5.  Site system check – after the customer’s critical load has been verified it will be connected to the UPS.  It will then be checked to ensure that under all operating conditions and power failure tests, that it performs all functions within its defined specifications and that the customer’s critical equipment is not affected.  The customer equipment should be set up in test conditions to avoid potential loss of data and/or communications. Final calibrations to the system are made during this part of the test procedure.

6.  Customer demonstration and training after the system has been functionally tested with the customer equipment, it is demonstrated to site personnel.  This can include any parties responsible for the UPS, as well as any other party from facilities/maintenance, operations, MIS, etc.  The training includes operational and maintenance instructions.  After the training is complete, site personnel will be able to turn the system on and off, take it in and out of bypass, read and understand the front panel gauges, respond to the trouble situations, and properly maintain the system.  The training will take approximately one (1) hour per session.  It is recommended to keep class sizes under six (6) people.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal, solicitation number is H92244-05-R-0082, and a firm fixed price contract is contemplated.

The Naval Special Warfare Development Group (NAVSPECWARDEVGRU) has a potential requirement to procure the following:

CLIN 0001 Repair, Refurbishment and Replacement of NAVSPECWARDEVGRU Obstacle Course in accordance with the following performance based statement of work:

Description of Current Course.  There are no records of date of construction but the course is at least fifteen (15) years old with adhoc repairs made over the years.  The telephone poles are in good shape and may or may not be practical for reuse on new events.  Most of the other materials will need to be replaced.

Limits of Construction.  No trees will be cut down but tree limbs may be trimmed as needed.  The open area between the canals, the tree line in the rear (near fenced area), and the area around the entrance are the border limits of this course; no construction is authorized outside of this area.  A NAVSPECWARDEVGRU representative will walk the perimeter area with vendor prior to start of construction to avoid misunderstanding.  During construction, the workmen will limit their activities to the immediate area when not in transition from the entry control point to the obstacle course.

Required Standards.  The US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Regulation 350-6 and Association of Challenge Course Technology (ACCT), or err on the side of safety.

The general requirements of all events and trail ways are as follows:  All materials used in this project will be of the highest quality and able to withstand years of exposure to the elements.  Soft material (ropes, nets, etc.) must be usable and safe for a minimum of three years (at which time these components will be replaced).  All wood products will be treated for outdoor use and made to last for a minimum of twelve years.  All treated materials will meet minimum safety standards for human use.  All metal products (nails, screws, bolts, hangers, etc) will either be galvanized or stainless-steel.  All events will be built in accordance with construction standards were the loads (platforms, crossbeams, etc) is transfer to the ground and not on bolts or screws – the loads will rest on notches on log or on top of posts.  The typical weight to be expected on any one event is 750 pounds (three people) and each event is required to have a minimum of 5:1 load rating (3,750 lbs or better) for safety.  The primary pathway (event to event) will be lined in a wood border and filed with a minimum of four inches of wood mulch.  The area around the events where a fall may happen will be filled with rubber mulch, and all areas that a fall are likely to happen will have a fall arrest device (net, crash pad, etc).   Because each event is different, some minor exceptions are authorized as long as they meet required standards.

Event #1 (Parallel Bars).  New event at the start of the course – similar to the one at the Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek.  A set of approximately 16 foot parallel bars ascends to three tiers.  The bars start at three feet high and should width apart then ascent to the first and highest tier.  The highest tier will be eight feet tall with each subsequent tier one foot lower – each tier is four feet long.  Support post of wood with wood mulch underneath the event.  

Event #2 (Five Pole Vault/Dirty Name).  Currently, there are five vaults in place.  Remove the last two vaults to make room for the dirty name event.  Dirty name built in accordance with TRADOC Reg. 350-6.  Past the dirty name two vaults will be added to the end mimicking the first two existing vaults.  Wood mulch added under vaults and rubber mulch under dirty name.

Event #3 (Rope Climb/Descending Platforms/Balance Beam).  Using existing logs, replace the platform and cross beam.  Replace current rope with 1.5 hemp climbing rope and have rubber mulch underneath.  Balance beam to be bolted to new cross support beams at each end and one in the middle.

Event #4 (Vertical Walls).  Using the existing logs, replace all boards and cap each event.  Fill in ruts on back side and cover with wood mulch on both sides

Event #5 (Rope Climb and Descent).  Using existing logs, replace face with tongue and groove planks on both sides with a cap on top.  Existing metal cross beam replaced with pole spar arm and replace existing rope with 1.5 inch hemp rope.    The area around the wall with has rubber mulch added for fall protection.

Event #6 (Skyscraper/Slide for Life).  This is one of two major events where safety is of primary concern; safety will not be compromised).  Complete replacement of existing event with one built IAW TRADOC Reg. 350-6 (pages 91 and 92).  This 40 foot tall hybrid event will combine two obstacles (skyscraper and slide for life) from Reg. 350-6.  This event will have a safety net about ¾ of the length of the slide rope (following down the ropes angle) ending where the height of the rope is less than eight feet.  This event will have rubber mulch under the entire slide and crash pads at the base of the tower.  Due to the scope of this event, a NAVSPECWARDEVGRU representative will be available to answer questions and provide details during construction.

Event #7 (The tough one).  New event built in open space (path) adjacent to Event #6 to be built in accordance with TRADOC Reg. 350-6 (page 89).  Rubber mulch will be spread under and around the event while crash pads will be located in the primary fall zone.

Event #8 (Monkey Bar/Tarzan).  Using existing poles, the approach side of the event will have a balance beam added similar to “The Tarzan” in TRADOC Reg. 350-6 (page 92).  The balance beam will be with a flattened “Z” in order to stay on path.  The log beam will be about three feet off the ground; each leg should be approximately ten feet.  The monkey bar portion will be raised to level at the approach end.  Wood mulch will be used underneath.

Event #9 (Incline Walls).  Existing event will be removed and replaced with three inclined wall built in accordance with TRADOC Reg. 350-6 (page 94) spaced about eight to ten feet apart with wood mulch around.

Event #10 (Vertical Net Climb).  This is one of two major events where safety is the primary concern; safety will not be compromised.  Current event will be replaced with a 35 foot hybrid version of the typical “cargo net” climbing tower and uses the same safety features as the one at the Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek.  The change from that event is the “A” frame vertical posts – two posts per side to support the inverted “V” net keeping the net taunt with the help of tensioning cables.  The v-net is slightly declined to allow a falling climber to in effect slide down the net thus slowing the fall.  The net tapers outward at the bottom becoming a catch net and effectively absorbing the climbers fall.

Event #11 (Balance Beam/Swing, Stop and Jump).  This event is repaired/restored to original condition.  The improvements will include cross beam, timber pegged or through bolted and the platform built to meet general requirements.  The balance beam will be bolted mounted at both ends.  Rope replaced with 1.5 inch hemp and rubber mulch spread on swing area.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
	
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may 
file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of 
the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

HSAR 3052.209–70  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE  EXPATRIATES (DEC 2003). 

 (a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107–296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity, does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002. 
    (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

As prescribed in 12.301(b)(1), insert the following provision: 
Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Jan 2005) 
(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small 
business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for 
this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). 
However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer 
in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself 
manufacture, is 500 employees. 
(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office 
specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this 
solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or 
as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show -- 
(1) The solicitation number; 
(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers; 
(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; 
(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to 
evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include 
product literature, or other documents, if necessary; 
(5) Terms of any express warranty; 
(6) Price and any discount terms; 
(7) “Remit to” address, if different than mailing address; 
(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 
(see FAR 52.212-3(j) for those representations and certifications that the 
offeror shall complete electronically); 
(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments; 
(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to 
include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other 
references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone 
numbers and other relevant information); and 
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement 
specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions 
included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required 
representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the 
solicitation may be excluded from consideration. 
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in 
its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of 
offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the 
solicitation. 
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall 
be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless 
otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at 
no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender’s request and expense, 
unless they are destroyed during preaward testing. 
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers 
presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying 
the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated 
separately. 
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, 
revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in 
the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is 
specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, 
for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are 
due. 
(2) 
(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at 
the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time 
specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it 
is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that 
accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and— 
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by 
the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the 
Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the 
date specified for receipt of offers; or 
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the 
Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the 
Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or 
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal 
received. 
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes 
its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it 
is received and may be accepted. 
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government 
installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer 
wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, 
or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. 
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government 
processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated 
for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and 
urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other 
notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of 
offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the 
solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the 
exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral 
solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile 
offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the 
exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in 
the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in 
person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time 
set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is 
established and the person signs a receipt for the offer. 
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government 
intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with 
offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s 
best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government 
reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the 
Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all 
offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest 
offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. 
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an 
offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless 
otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities 
less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award 
on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices 
offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer. 
(i) Availability of requirements documents cited in the solicitation.

are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the 
Government to exercise the option(s). 
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise 
furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in 
the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either

receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 
(End of Provision) 

OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)

(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen:

<DESC>Surface Warfare Officer School (SWOS) will implement tailored training for prospective Surface Warfare Department Heads within 2 months.  In order for this tailored training approach to be effective the contractor will draw from existing technologies to select a set of assessment measures to be used as an entry-level screening methodology for students entering Department Head training at SWOS.  The assessment measures will afford identification of knowledge and skill deficiencies of incoming trainees, providing the foundation for tailored training.  More specifically, the assessment methodology will provide a strategy for assigning trainees to the classroom, simulation-based, or live training that would be most beneficial given individual knowledge/skill strengths and deficiencies.  The constructs to be assessed will focus on specific job knowledge domains the trainee may be expected to possess, to varying degrees, upon entry into Department Head training at SWOS.  More specifically, the focus will be on constructs emphasized within the Combat Systems Core curriculum, including but not limited to Air Defense (AD) and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR).

<DESC>The Social Security Administration is seeking quotations for forensic workstations. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. A written request for quotation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted as a simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 13. The solicitation document and incorporated providions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04. The North American Industry Classification System code for this acquisition is 541512. The small business size standard is $21 million. FAR Subpart 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial, applies to this acquisition. See specific instructions below. All vendors shall include with their quotation, a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items.

Delivery shall be made within 30 days after the receipt of order (ARO) to the delivery locations listed on attachment number three.

ITEM DESCRIPTION

This requirement is for a quantity of six (6) forensic workstations per the attached salient characteristics.

INSTRUCTIONS TO VENDORS

Along with your price quotation, you must submit technical literature in order for the government to verify that your products are technically acceptable in accordance with the minimum salient characteristics in this RFQ.

GENERAL:

Past Performance: (Past performance is a measure of how well a company performed under previous opportunities.)  The Government intends to make a subjective assessment of how well the contractor(s) has performed in the past The Government’s policy is to use information about a contractor’s past performance when making its determination on which GSA contractor represents the best value and lowest overall cost alternative.  This policy is based on the notion that a contractor’s past experience and record of satisfying its customers in the past is indicative, though not necessarily determinative, of the likelihood that it will do so in the future.  Therefore, vendors shall submit the following references in order to assist the Government in making its best value determination. 

Experience:  (Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing and previous opportunities indicate the breadth, depth and relevance of a company’s abilities.)  The Government intends to make a subjective assessment of the ability of the contractor(s) based on their past experiences with similar requirements.  The ability of the contractor(s) to perform this requirement correlates to the degree of risk for non-performance the Government will be exposed to. The vendor must have experience in providing forensic workstations within the past three years. 

The vendor shall provide three (3) references, including company/agency name, contact person, and phone number. 
The vendor shall provide the following additional information:
•	Federal Tax ID Number:
•	GSA Schedule Contract Number:
•	Tax ID:
•	DUNS Number:
•	Expiration date of GSA schedule

SECTION 508:

1.	Requirements for Section 508 Evaluation Template

Any products and/or services the Government intends to acquire based on this RFQ must allow the Government to support its obligations under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  The text of the applicable standards, are identified in Attachment number two to this RFQ.

A completed Section 508 Evaluation Template (see http://www.ssa.gov/oag/acq/oagacq_508.htm) will be required for each product and service indicated in the statement of work.  In cases where a service is being purchased (e.g., Contractor Support Services), the contractor shall complete any sections of the template that correspond to the service’s provided “deliverables”.  Items that qualify as “deliverables” would be presentations, troubleshooting manuals, user guides, training information, etc.

When a contractor completes the Section 508 Evaluation Template they must state exactly how their product/service does or does not meet the applicable Section 508 standards.  Merely stating that a product/service is compliant or noncompliant with the applicable Section 508 standards, without explicitly stating how, may result in that product/service being removed from consideration in the award of the contract.  Contractors are cautioned to address each standard individually and with specificity.

Contractors will also find a link to “SSA’s Guide to Completing a Section 508 Evaluation Template” at the site indicated above for a completed Section 508 Evaluation Template.  

2.	Instructions Relative to Accessible Product Documentation

The Social Security Administration (SSA) requires that all documentation provided with a product be in an electronic accessible format.  In order for SSA to adequately evaluate this documentation, please provide this documentation labeled "accessible documentation" on a separate CD, in an appropriately labeled folder with the product, or through a link to a web site where the link specifies the accessible documentation separate from the standard documentation. If the standard documentation provided commercially is already in an accessible format please state that explicitly in your response.

3.	Instructions Relative to Section 508 Standards and Equivalent Facilitation     
  
To be considered eligible for award, contractors must propose products and/or services that meet the applicable provisions of the Section 508 standards as identified by the Agency.  Alternatively, contractors may propose products and/or services that provide equivalent facilitation.  Equivalent facilitation is a recognition that technologies may be either developed or used in ways not envisioned by the technical provisions in Attachment two, but still result in the same or better functional access as would be provided by strictly meeting the provisions in Attachment two.  Functional outcome, not form, is the key to evaluating whether a technology results in “substantially equivalent or greater access.”

If a contractor proposes to meet Section 508 standards in this manner, they must address Section 1194.31, Functional Performance Criteria, of Section 508.  Furthermore, any associated costs must be identified.

Such quotes will be considered to have met the provisions of the Section 508 standards as identified in Attachment two, for the feature or component providing equivalent facilitation.

4.	SSA’s Right to Perform Testing on a Contractor’s Product

SSA reserves the right to perform testing on a contractor’s product in order to ensure the accuracy of their documentation regarding Section 508 and SSA’s accessibility requirements.  If requested, the contractor will provide SSA with a copy of the product being considered for purchase so that we may validate any of their claims of accessibility within our own testing lab.  The product being provided for testing purposes must be equivalent to the final commercially available release version in terms of functionality and features.  Demonstration and/or Trial versions of a product, therefore, will NOT be considered for testing purposes.  This is necessary since limits imposed in the functionality and features would detract from accurate testing of a product’s “level of compliance” with Section 508 and SSA’s accessibility requirements.  In addition to the actual product, any documentation (i.e. training guides, user manuals, etc.) and a Test Plan illustrating a “typical” user scenario(s) must be included in order to ensure fair and accurate testing by SSA.

Upon award, the product(s) provided for testing by all unsuccessful contractors will be returned, at the contractor’s expense.  The successful contractor’s product(s) will be retained and will be accounted for in any resultant order, if applicable.  If an order is not imminent, the successful contractor’s products(s) shall also be returned, at the contractor’s expense.

5.	Contents of Quotation 

Technical:  

For each product offered, the contractor must discuss how each mandatory requirement or specification is met.  This is especially true for the SSA’s Accessibility Standards and Section 508 Accessibility Standards.

If this acquisition is for a product(s), contractors are requested to submit hard copy technical publications, glossy brochures, etc. regarding the characteristics of the proposed product(s) to support their compliance with the requirements contained in this RFQ.

If this acquisition is for services, or contains service requirements, the contractor shall provide written acknowledgement for each requirement stating that they have read and agree to comply with the requirements stated.  As applicable, contractors must also indicate how each requirement shall be met and identify the service provider.

Cost:

The contractor shall break out any additional costs which may be associated with meeting the requirements of Section 508 or SSA’s Accessibility Requirements which are not incorporated in the tables.

EVALUATION METHODOLOGY AND RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF EVALUATION FACTORS

    Contractors will be evaluated by following the step process outlined below.

•	First, the quoted product(s) will be evaluated to determine if they are technically acceptable, which means that the offered product(s) must meet all mandatory technical specifications.  As part of this step, in addition to reviewing the contractor’s written description of how the offered products meet the technical specifications, the Government may perform a hands-on technical evaluation to independently verify the technical acceptability of the offered products.  

•	Second, provided an offer meets all of the technical requirements, product(s) shall then be evaluated for compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and SSA’s Accessibility Requirements. The evaluation will consist of reviewing the information in the contractor’s response and utilizing the document, entitled “SSA Guide to Applying Section 508 Standards,” to determine compliance (refer to http://www.ssa.gov/oag/acq/oagacq_508.htm). The evaluation may also include a hands-on evaluation, which SSA will conduct using an internally developed evaluation system to assess the product’s “level of compliance” with Section 508 and SSA’s Accessibility Requirements.

Award will be made to the contractor who is fully 508 compliant (including SSA’s Accessibility Requirements).  If more than one contractor quotes fully 508 compliant products in this manner, SSA will conduct the best value analysis set forth in the third step below to determine which of the fully 508 compliant quotes will receive the award.

If there are no fully 508-compliant quotes as described above, SSA will award to the most 508-compliant quote.  If a hands-on evaluation is used, most compliant will be determined according to the internally developed evaluation system.

If there are two or more contractors whose responses are considered to be equally 508 compliant (as described above), SSA will conduct the best value analysis set forth in the third step below to distinguish between those equally 508 compliant quotes.  
  
NOTE:

(1) Award will not be made to a contractor meeting all or some of the applicable Section 508 standards if award would impose an undue burden upon the Agency.

•	Third, in the event two or more contractors are considered equally Section 508 compliant as described above, award will be made to the contractor whose solution represents the best value considering price and other factors in accordance with FAR Subparts 8.404 and 8.405.

The offeror should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, o r affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the offeror's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to succ essfully meet the requirements of the RFP.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFP.

Since the tsunami disaster, the Mission’s program has seen an increased need to respond to public inquiries, substantially increasing the workload related to information dissemination.  The radically increased scope and visibility of the Mission’s efforts require proactive and thorough dissemination of information on Mission activities.  The Development Outreach and Communications Officer (DOC) therefore seeks to secure the services of a firm well experienced in preparation and production of outreach materials to implement this strategy.
III.	Statement of Work
A.	Objectives
The purpose of this contract is to provide assistance to the USAID/Sri Lanka Mission to develop and produce media and outreach materials.  These include, but are not limited to, the following initiatives:
•	Design and production of informational brochures
Source material including text and photographs will come from within the Mission.  Required service includes design and production of brochures including but not necessarily limited to a Mission overview; each of the Mission’s four Strategic Objectives, and Tsunami Relief and Reconstruction.  These will come in the form of folding three-ply documents, plus a complete package of replacable and updatable cards within a folder produced with artwork illustrating the Mission’s programs.
•	50th Anniversary Campaign.  
USAID celebrates its 50th Anniversary of activity in Sri Lanka in April of 2006.  Accordingly, a celebratory campaign must be designed and executed in the months leading up to a main event to be held on or about April of next year.  This might include production and distribution of posters, media tours to Missoin projects, speaking engagements by key mission staff.   The campaign will also include production and distribution of caps, t-shirts, key chains, pens, stickers and other giveaway items readily produced in Sri Lanka. 
•	Design, production and distribution of branding products.  USAID seeks to promote the newly-created brand before the public.  Separate from the 50th anniversary items, the Mission wants to undertake a general awareness promotional campaign via distribution of the products mentioned in the previous paragraph, and is eager to entertain suggestions about other branding products especially relevant to the Sri Lankan public.
•	Organization of media site visits.  USAID is eager to cultivate relationships with the local print and televised media.  To that end, anticipated 12 media site visits for six journalists each.  In consultation with USAID, the contractor will select sites, assemble the journalists, organize scheduling, lodging, transport and other logisitics for the tours.
•	Staff speakers.  Senior international and Sri Lankan staff represent a wealth of information about development activities within the Mission’s four strategic objectives.  As such, they are valuable tools to publicize the Mission’s work to Sri Lankan audiences, both at the academic and community level.  The contractor will arrange such events as appropriate.
This list is illustrative only and the actual products will be determined over the course of the contract period by the DOC.  The DOC will provide guidance and textual research materials to the contractor and will obtain approvals and modifications from Mission staff.  
Media materials will be used to publicize the following events and programs:
•	Visits by VIP officials and other visitors.  The mission receives hundreds of visitors each year and needs to have a stock of briefing materials on hand
•	Program brochures.  These will consist of replaceable cards or other materials in a folder with information about individual program elelments, budget information, photographs, etc.  that can be maintaned by the DOC upon completion of the contract. 
B.	Deliverables
Working with the DOC, the Contractor will prepare appropriate representations—mockups, draft materials, storyboards, as appropriate—of the products described above, for review by mission staff.  Upon approval of each item, the Contractor will ensure production, printing, manufacture and distribution as appropriate.
C. Relationships and Responsibilities
The contractor will report directly to the DOC Officer or his/her designee.  In addition, the contractor will be required to coordinate closely with all USAID/SriLanka program managers, the US government agencies in Srilanka and Partners as needed to secure information about USAID programs and strategies.
III. Qualifications

The contractor/firm will have:
•	A proven track record in media and publicity efforts in Sri Lanka;
•	Corporate Capacity to develop creative materials and advise on media strategies and demonstrated past experience of similar work undertaken;
•	Experience in working in high-profile and very fluid environments and with disaster situations desirable;
•	At least 5 years of Experience with television, radio and other print media; and 
•	Demonstrated experience interacting with USG officials and public as well as the Sri Lankan government and public at various levels.
IV.  Performance Period and Estimated Level of Effort
	The expected duration of the contract/work is 12 months, from o/a October 2005 through 2006.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post answers to questions received on the solicitation.  Since the quote package is due on 9/14/2005 no further questions will be addressed.

Question 1: Can I bring Garmin IV handheld GPS units to your G.I.S. specialists and have the Arcview shape files downloaded into these handheld units?  This is what we did for the Hayman Fire and other projects that we have done.  

Answer 1: Yes the Government can download the shapefiles onto a Garmin.  
 
Question 2: What potential staging area is best suited for large semi trucks to access?  

Answer 2: The best areas for trucks would be the northwest one at Dalton Lake.  The area is approximately 2.5 acres (where the straw could be unloaded).  The other one with a good road is is the southwest one (southwest of the fire).  The only concern on this road is that there is a grade when you come off of the highway.  They would be starting up it from a complete stop.  Not impossible, just annoying.  By far the best staging area (but the worst access) is the remaining one north of the fire.  There is one corner on this road that would be a concern, the road is somewhat rough compared to the others and does not provide much room for error (some spots are kind of steep).  There is a private road off of the interstate right to the site.  It would be nice if the contractor could get access through there.  There is one tight corner (at the lower end of the private road), but believe there is enough room to get a semi up it.  If the contractor is considering hauling straw in on doubles, it is recommended that they look at all sites for themselves.  It would be fairly difficult to get them turned around at any of the sites.
 
Question 3: If we identify staging areas that may be closer or more suitable for truck access will the USFS perform the noxious weed and archeaological surveys and clearances or do we need to hire an independant consultant?    

Answer 3: Yes.  We identified the best places near where the work would be done, but that doesn't mean there aren't better sites further off or on private land.  The Government will make sure someone is available to assist with heritage and archeological concerns if this comes up.

HSAR 3009.104-75  PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), 
except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of provision)

SOLICITATION HSCG80-05-Q-313V37                                                 

SUBJECT:  JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Pursuant to the requirements of FAR 13.501(a) Sole Source Acquisitions, the following facts and rationale are presented:

	(1) Identification of the agency and the contracting activity, and specific identification of the document as a “Justification for other than full and open competition.” – U.S. Coast Guard, Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic (MLCLANT), Naval Engineering Division, Vessel Procurement and Logistics Branch, Norfolk, VA, hereby presents this Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (JOTFOC) for review and approval.

        	(2) Nature and/or description of the action being approved. – This Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition seeks approval to contract with the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Northrop Grumman Sperry Marine Systems or a certified Sperry Marine Systems distributor.  Request approval to proceed with this sole source acquisition, for a firm fixed-price purchase order for Sperry Marine Rascar Radar Model 2500-M-X X-Band Radar and Model 2500M-3145 S-band Radar Parts.  Simplified acquisition procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  

	(3) A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs (including the estimated value). – This Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition is to obtain approval for the procurement of Sperry Marine Rascar Radar Model 2500-M-X X-Band Radar and Model 2500M-3145 S-Band Radar Parts.  The primary function of the Rascar Radar is to navigational information regarding other ships for the purpose of safe navigation and interception of other vessels.   The radar provides this navigational information for the WPC-179 Cyclone Class Patrol Coastal ships.  The information provided by this radar system is vital to the ships ability to perform its law enforcement and national defense missions and to safely navigate.  This requirement is essential to the mission capability of the U.S. Coast Guard's  WPC-179 Cyclone Class Patrol Coastal ships.  The estimated dollar value for this procurement is $105,000.00.

	(4) An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition. – Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as implemented by FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

	(5) A demonstration that the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited. – Rascar Radar Model 2500-M-27X-Band Radar and Model 2500M-3145 S-Band Radar Parts are currently in use on the WPC-179 Cyclone Class Patrol Coastal radar systems.  Utilizing Northup Grumman’s Sperry Marine Systems (OEM) for the Sperry Marine Rascar Radar Parts will maintain the design function of the Rascar Radar system and minimize failure due to non-compatible parts.  The necessary

SUBJECT:  JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


manufacturing data are proprietary and controlled by Northup Grumman Sperry Marine Systems.  The data was not procured for the radars currently used on the WPC-179 Cyclone Class Patrol Coastal ships and therefore were not available for release to generate competition 

	(6)  A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether an EPS notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2, and if not, which exception under 5.202 applies. – In accordance with FAR 5.201, the intent to contract for Sperry Marine Radar Parts will be advertised on the Electronic Posting System (EPS)/FedBizOpps.  

	(7)  A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable. – It is the Contracting Officer’s opinion that prices for this procurement will be fair and reasonable based on limited competition between privately owned businesses, price analysis and similar items used in the commercial marketplace.  Additionally, proposed prices will undergo comparison with previously prices paid. 

	(8) A description of the market research conducted (see Part 10) and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. – There are several sources that manufacture similar radars in the commercial marketplace; however, a similar unit would require unique modifications to the Sperry Marine Rascar Radar System.  Sperry Marine Rascar Radar Model 2500-M27X X-Band and 2500M-3145 S-Band are only radars that meets form, fit and function required without modification to the Radar Systems.  

	(9) A listing of the sources, if any, which expressed in writing, an interest in the acquisition. –   Only one company, Northrop Grumman, responded to the Sources Sought posted to FedBizOpps.  Northup Grumman is the OEM for the Sperry Marine Rascar Radars.  A presolicitation notice will be issued on FedBizOpps.  All interested companies will be considered.  

(10) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required. – The Coast Guard does not possess technical expertise nor did they purchase the data as part of the initial system acquisition for the Sperry Marine Rascar Radar System to foster a competitive procurement effort.  Complete specifications and drawings are not available and the cost to procure them is not easily quantifiable.  As a result, it would be difficult to foster competition, as the Coast Guard does not have copyrights, proprietary data, adequate technical descriptions of the manufacturing, performance and acceptance data for the radars.  The current systems are deteriorating to the

SUBJECT:  JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
	

point that system replacement is being looked at for the future at which time the Coast Guard intends to develop a specification, which will promote competition.  In the meantime the Sperry Marine Rascar Radar System must be replaced with remanufactured parts from the original equipment manufacturer, Northrop Gurmman Sperry Marine Systems or authorized distributor.  

(12) I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>Amendment 0001 is hereby being issued to the subject solicitation.  The purpose of this amendment is to answer technical questions and to make one correction to the CLIN structure.  1.  QUESTION 1: If the offeror proposes multiple sources as described in Specifications paragraph 4.c., must the required minimum source level per 4.a. be met only within the three bands (380 to 420 Hz, 900 to 1100 Hz, and 2000 to 5000 kHz), or must it be met across the entire 200 to 5000 Hz frequency range?  ANSWER TO QUESTION 1: The minimim source level (188 decibels re 1 micropascal at 1 meter) must be met throughout the frequency interval from 200 Hz to 5000 Hz.  QUESTION 2: In the last sentences of 4.d. and 4.e., is the band of operation of each of the multiple sources the same as the frequency band above, or is it the frequency band over which each source operates in order to meet the required minimum source level over the entire 200 to 5000 Hz frequency range?  ANSWER TO QUESTION 2: The requirements of 4.d. and 4.e. must be met at all frequencies from 200 Hz to 5000 Hz.  Paragraph 4.c. addresses cross-over frequencies.  If multiple sources are used, the government does not want a cross-over frequency occurring in any of the three bands listed (380-420 Hz, 900-1100 Hz, 2000-5000 Hz).  It should not be construed that the government is interested only in these bands; in fact, the government is interested in all freuencies from 200 to 5000 Hz.   2.  CLIN 0002 is hereby deleted in its entirety and marked as RESERVED.  Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm

<DESC>This is Modification No. 2 to the synopsis entitled Modular Front-End Components for Data Acquisition Commensurate with Structural Loads Testing of Large, Complex Space Structures NNM05122359Q which was posted on August 31, 2005.  You are notified that the following changes are made: The following questions have been received and are answered below: Question 1) Section 4 of the specification states that “the front-ends shall include all of the necessary hardware and software to control …the required communication interface to the existing Data Collector and Control Station software applications”.  A later paragraph states that the “functions …shall be automated via low level commands”, which seems to imply a DLL or static library, either currently operating or in a skeletal form. Could we have more information on the specifics of this interface?  Specifically, how is the communications interface structured (command and response mechanism), is there an existing set of commands that must be supported, and if so what are the commands, responses, and parameters.  If the work includes modifying an existing library, what language is it written in?  Question 1 Answer  Communication between the embedded controller running the Data Collector program and the instrumentation hardware shall be conducted via an ethernet interface.  A software interface shall be provided that enables the Data Collector to access the hardware command set for such system functions as setting filters, gains, accessing the calibration bus and accessing the millivolt value of all transducer inputs including any thermocouple reference junctions.  The millivolt values are required so that all calculations can be performed externally.  Examples of such an interface include DLLs, active X controls and GPIB command sets.  The end user must be free to distribute this interface. Question 2) Are calibration programs required as part of this work, will we be expected to modify existing calibration programs, or are calibration functions included in the communications interface with the Control Station software?  If we will need to modify existing code, what language is it written in?	If we will be expected to provide a calibration program, must it be windows-aware or can it be a console operation?  Question 2 Answer:  Calibration functionality and low level commands such as the ability to read and modify calibration coefficients are needed. We will provide the calibration program. No modification to existing calibration programs or functions is required. Question 3) Will we have access to copies of the Data Collector and Control Station software as part of our development work?  Question 3 Answer:  Access to the Data Collector and Control Station should not be required.   Question 4) Are security clearances and secured facilities required for this work?  Can foreign nationals work on this project?  Can part of the work be sent overseas?  Question 4 Answer:  No security clearances or secured facilities are required for this work since it will not be on site; if foreign nationals work on this they must be identified as well as the country they represent; clauses included in solicitation give guidance/restrictions to foreign work and purchases of foreign items. The due date for responses is NOT extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/MSFC Business Opportunities home page is   http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=62    Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions received from an interested party. NOTE: The RFQ due date remains unchanged. Q1.  The solicitation indicated that the contract was a firm fixed price with travel as a cost reimbursable not to e xceed $65,000.  However, in section 9 of the RFQ (p. 25 of 26), 'travel will be reimbursable, not to exceed $25,000'.  What is the amount that travel should not exceed?  A1. The correct Travel amount is $25,000. Q2. According to the section 'instructions to offerors & proposals submission' on p. 21 of 26, the technical volume should not exceed 20 pages; past performance should not exceed 10 pages; and resumes should not be longer than 3 pages each.  This section i ndicated that past performance and resumes were part of the technical volume.  As such, is the page limit for past performance and resumes part of the 20 page limit for the technical volume or are they separate volumes?  A2. Past Performance should not exc eed 10 pages and the Technical should not exceed 20 pages. Q3. In what size font should the proposal be drafted? A3. 11-Font Q4. Regarding Past Performance, there was not a questionnaire included in the RFQ to be submitted to our references for comments.  Does DIA have a specific questionnaire that we must use?  If so, may we have a copy.  Must Past performance questionnaires be  sent to DIA prior to the proposal deadline or must they be included in the proposal? A4. Past performance will be submitted with the offerors proposal. All communications regarding this solicitation will be made with the Contract Specialist, Maria Hayes, or with the Contracting Officer, Austin J. Sansone. No contact will be made with the t echnical. There is no questionnaire - your references will be included with your past performance information Q5. Could you tell me if this is a new requirement or is there an incumbent already in place?  A5. No incumbent.
