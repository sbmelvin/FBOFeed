<SUBJECT>A -- Over the Horizon, Tactical Communications in Support of Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare
<SOLNBR>M67854-02-R-6023
<RESPDATE>031802

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) is issuing a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Research and Development (R&D) concepts addressing a tactical communications capability in support of Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare (EMW), to be demonstrated during Olympic Challenge in May 2004.  In the advent of Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare (EMW) the demands on a communications system will be different from that of today. 

The operational thrust will be for more combat power and less support structure in theater. Future communications systems must be simple to use so as to reduce the number of specialists operators. The equipment must require the minimal infrastructure, so as to reduce on board stowage space, the logistic tail and crucially, manpower. The system must take account of communications on the move in the triad of United States Marine Corps (USMC) vehicles, MV-22, AAAV and LCAC, as well as to dismounted troops. This triad will provide unparalleled maneuver capability to avoid strong points and exploit uncovered vulnerabilities. The communications system must be dynamic and cover the complete maneuver space within the expeditionary area. Ideally, there should be no ground-based infrastructure, such as relays, if they prove to be unresponsive to change and isolated, requiring protection by the combat force. The now highly maneuverable elements will be Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) to each other, yet still need to communicate for mutual support. This suggests the need for an overhead capability to support specific missions over areas of complex terrain such as the urban environment. 

At the tactical level, the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) will be available to the Operating Forces in the 2010-20 timeframe. This BAA concentrates on the parts of an EMW communications capability that is not currently within JTRS. Fundamentally, it is the capability to provide secure voice and data communications to the dismounted tactical warfighter in combat conditions as he conducts EMW over distances of 200 miles in complex terrain. This capability should be available to every independent commander who can be tasked with an individual mission. The mission commander will require 200 mile communications for command, fires and logistic support back to the next higher authority who will remain afloat for as long as possible, perhaps indefinitely, in line with EMW doctrine. Therefore, at the very least, this capability must be available down to the Company/RECON Commander level.  

In keeping will military tactical communications, the system must be designed to provide assured, instantaneous, netted and protected communications through electronic measures such as Anti-Jam, Low Probability Of Intercept And Detection (AJ/LPI/LPD). Ideally, the capability would also allow the prioritization of traffic. Whilst the highest possible bandwidth is always desirable, this capability is needed to pass the essential maneuver and strike enablers (command voice, fires and position data) at the critical entry phase to the assault operation. Bandwidth hungry applications must rely upon other communications paths to be established. The capability must be contained with a 2 ? 3 pounds, hand held device and be of fit/form/function that a non-skilled operator can use it with ease and without moving tactical position (i.e. omni directional propagation vice directed antennas). It must also support clandestine communications to RSTA elements such as RECON teams and unmanned sensors, deployed days before the main maneuver assaults. It must also be designed for use within a ship, craft or vehicle, with some form of accommodation for a remote antenna.

The system architecture must enable the tactical warfighter to communicate over distances of 200 miles using the minimum manned infrastructure. The system architecture must also provide a blanket communications coverage over the Naval Expeditionary Force (NEF) area (200 NM2) to enable unrestricted reconnaissance and the maneuver of forces between departure points, through multiple Littoral Penetration Points (LPPs) and on to the objective. Communications must be maintained throughout the extended transits to allow for mid-transit re-planning and re-direction. 

Olympic Challenge (USMC subset is Olympic Dragon) will take place in May 2004 and will be demonstrating capabilities projected into the 2010-20 time frame. The USMC aim will be to demonstrate Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM). Olympic Challenge is seen as a vehicle for demonstrating an initial EMW tactical communications capability supporting approximately 6 voice/data nets with 60 handsets. A clear proposal for the development of this capability for Olympic Challenge through to transition to a Program of Record and the Operational Forces will be required. It is noted that whilst security cannot be compromised it is acknowledged that a prototype capability cannot provide Type I encryption. However, this subsequent upgrade should be considered in design. A copy of the Universal Needs Statement (UNS) that supports this desired capability is available upon request from Nick Cusack at cusackn@mcwl.quantico.usmc.mil.

Process: The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory will review proposals that address the desired capabilities stated above. Proposals that do not address the identified technology area will not be reviewed. Respondents shall first submit a one to five page "white paper" summarizing the proposed effort(s) and a rough order of cost magnitude in order to obtain a preliminary indication of MCWL interest. It may be desired, but not required, for the contractor to present a technical briefing on the white paper at Quantico, Virginia. Technical briefings should always follow the formal submission of a white paper. The Government is not liable for any costs associated with this brief. White papers, proposals, and all related correspondence should reference BAA Number M67854-02-R-6023. White papers shall be submitted in original form and three (3) copies to ONLY the following address: Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory, Marine Corps Combat Development Command, 3255 Meyers Avenue, Attn: Dottie Wright, Quantico, Virginia 22134.

Submitted white papers should indicate the willingness of the contractor to provide a technical briefing, should one be requested by MCWL. Contractors are allowed to submit multiple quality white papers, but the submission of numerous boilerplate white papers may result in the un-reviewed, automatic rejection of all submitted papers. Once a white paper is submitted, all further communications must be submitted in writing to the MCWL Procurement Analyst, Dottie Wright. Should MCWL determine that a submitted "white paper" has scientific and technical merit relevant for Laboratory requirements, it will ask the Marine Corps Systems Command Contracting Office to request the offeror to submit an in-depth proposal for each selected white paper. In depth proposal(s) should be divided into three sections: (1) A technical section which includes a clear statement of objectives, technical approach and methodology, supporting technical information (including an indication of proprietary aspects of the proposed effort), and a plan of action and milestones; (2) A management section which includes a description of relevant corporate expertise, experience, facilities, and other relevant resources, resumes of key personnel; and (3) A cost section, which provides a detailed breakdown of the proposed effort, described in the technical section. All options and assumptions shall be clearly identified and defined. Proposal evaluation and award decision will be based on Best Value to MCWL considering technical merit, importance to agency programs, availability of funds, cost realism and reasonableness. The Best Value determination will address the following considerations: 

1. The relevance of the proposal to the system requirements described above. 
2. The anticipated warfighting operational utility of the proposed capability.
3. The ability of the proposed system to be ready for field-testing or to be complete within 18 months of contract award. 
4. The overall suitability of the proposed capability for inclusion in warfighting experiments. 
5. Projected affordability of transitioning the technology to the Operating Force (for any developed hardware). 
6. Past performance, experience and qualification of the principal project personnel and/or Institution Corporation submitting the proposal. 
7. Realism of the proposed cost and availability of funding. 

This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available, nor will a formal Request For Proposal (RFP) or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded. The government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement but anticipates making an award with the approximately $3,500,000.00 expected to be budgeted for this effort up to and including support on Olympic Challenge.  This BAA shall remain open for receipt of white paper proposals for a period of 45 days from the date of initial publication of this announcement. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this BAA is 541710 with the small business size of 1,500 employees. No portion of this BAA has been set aside for historically black colleges and universities or minority institute participants, though their participation is encouraged. For awards made as contracts, evaluation of the socio-economic merits of the proposal shall include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions. If the contracting officer requests a full cost proposal, and the total exceeds $500,000, any large business is required to include a Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Woman Owned Subcontracting Plan with its proposal package in accordance with FAR 52.219-9. 

White papers will be evaluated in the order in which they are received and may be accepted at any time within the 45-day period. White papers/proposals will not be evaluated against each other since each is a unique technology with no common work statement. Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract; however, there is no commitment by the Marine Corps to make any awards, to make a specific number of awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by the proposer before award of a contract. Information provided herein is subject to amendment and in no way binds the Government to award of a contract. Clarification questions must be submitted in writing, quoting BAA Number M67854-02-R-6023 in the title. Questions and answers will be posted under ?Projects? on the MCWL website http://www.mcwl.quantico.usmc.mil. Address technical questions to Nick Cusack at cusackn@mcwl.quantico.usmc.mil. Questions of a business or contractual nature may be directed to Dottie Wright at wrightd@mcwl.quantico.usmc.mil . The Government will not screen white paper topics on behalf of a contractor in advance of the submission of a white paper.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights (OCR), has a requirement for a  small business set-aside to provide services for the 2002 Elementary and Secondary School Civil Rights Compliance Report.  The Elementary and Secondary School Civil Rights Compliance Report survey (E&S Survey), conducted since 1968, serves as the cornerstone for the Department's civil rights records keeping system as it obtains source data and information regarding civil rights compliance in the nation's public elementary and secondary schools.  Information collected in the E&S Survey is used to help the Office for Civil Rights identify existing and emerging civil rights problems in public schools, examine the status of civil rights in each state and in the nation, determine changes in longitudinal trend data in various civil rights issues, and provide baseline and source material for technical assistance programs. Survey information for the 2000 E&S Survey was collected from school districts on a one-page ED-101 form, and from individual schools in the sampled district on a 10-page ED-102 form.  The procurement for the 2002 E&S Survey is planned for an 18 month performance based small business set-aside contract for producing, mailing and otherwise distributing surveys; receiving completed surveys by both mail and electronic media, processing data forms which are received, including editing and error correction processes to a final file for additional processing by an existing statistical services contractor.  The 2002 E&S Survey will sample approximately one-third of the nation?s public schools representing approximately 60% of the nations school buildings.  In the 2000 E&S Survey response rates were 97% for school districts and 99% for schools in school districts.  This procurement is open to small businesses only.  The anticipated issue date is on or about February 27, 2002.  The closing date for receipt of proposals is March 27, 2002.  Request for copies of the RFP may be made by telephone, mail, telegram, Internet or in person.  All requests shall reference RFP: ED-02-R-0010 and the title.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command and the Program Executive Officer, Expeditionary Warfare (PEO EXW) are seeking information from interested sources toward a potential future replacement of the LCU 1600 Class Utility Craft.  (The nature and format of the information requested is discussed later in this announcement.)  The LCU(R) will provide a technologically advanced, heavy lift, utility landing craft to complement the high speed, over-the-horizon, ship-to-objective amphibious lift required by Operational Maneuver - From the Sea (OMFTS) and Seabased Logistics. Primary and Secondary missions, Required Operational Capabilities, Threat and Threat Environment, Constraints, and Operational Environment for the LCU(R) are depicted in the LCU(R) Mission Need Statement (MNS). The MNS and other official LCU(R) documents that can be found on the LCU(R) web site at http://lcur.navsea.navy.mil. The craft will be built to ABS and commercial standards, specifications and practices. The production contract will specify the preliminary delivery of two (2) Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) craft in FY06 for operational testing and evaluation. Upon completion of the testing period, estimated at twelve(12) months or less, the government will authorize Full Scale Production (FSP) of the remaining craft (presently set at 14 to 22 craft). Note: The current SCN budget is about $60M/yr and is based on the replacement of five (5) LCU per year for a duration of seven (7) years starting with a "Best Value" contract award in FY05. The current status of the LCU(R) program is as follows: The LCU(R) Program is in the Concept and Technology Development Phase. The objective of this phase is to obtain Concept and Feasibility Design Studies from Industry for the purpose of developing a Performance Specification (PS) that will respond to the LCU(R) Mission Need Statement (MNS) and Operational Requirements Document (ORD). The Performance Specification will be the Technical Data Package used to award a multi-craft procurement contract starting in FY05. It is planned that any procurement for the production of the LCU(R) will be on a competitive basis, regardless of whether the offerors participated in any of the LCU(R) design phases. As part of the Concept and Technology Development Phase, a BAA (PSA 2754) similar to this BAA, was issued 26 December 2000 for concept papers that would lead to the awards of contracts for Feasibility Design Studies.  The December 2000 BAA anticipated an LCU(R) design with a maximum 30-ft beam. Upon review of the white papers submitted in response to BAA (PSA 2754), contracts were awarded to ten (10) of the participants to condu ct Feasibility Design Studies (FDS).  No contract awards for the development of a Performance Specification have been made as a result of the 30-ft. beam Feasibility Design Studies. Contractors, which received contracts for Feasibility Design Studies in June 2001, may not submit another proposal or proposals under the BAA described below. This BAA is for Feasibility Design Studies for an LCU(R) with a maximum 45-ft beam.  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) is being developed by the Center for Naval Analysis (CNA) to evaluate the operational effectiveness and estimated cost of alternative systems. The studies resulting from this BAA are, in part to support the AoA in determining number and size of craft necessary to meet LCU(R) mission needs and required operational capabilities.  Final AoA report is due late May 2002, upon which the Navy will decide an alternative to pursue in order to best meet its overall amphibious lift requirements. This decision is not expected to take place until June/July 2002 time frame. Contract awards for the development of a (Commercial Design Performance Specification (Phase III of the LCU(R) design program) is predicated upon the Government's decision as to an alternative to pursue in meeting its amphibious lift requirements. The Government might decide to procure a new LCU(R) having a narrow beam (maximum of 30 ft) or a new LCU(R) having a wider beam (maximum of 45 ft).  The Government might decide not to procure any new LCU(R), in which case, no awards will be made for Phase III. LCU 1600 PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS: For reference, the current 135' LCU has the following principle characteristics:         Length Overall: 134' 9"         Beam Max: 29' 9"         Hull Depth Amidships: 8' 0"         Lightship Weight: 220 Long Tons         Construction: Steel         Cargo Capacity: 143 Long Tons including ballast         Cargo Deck: 2,200 sq ft         Range: 1200 NM at 8 knots in full load condition         Maximum Speed: 11 knots in full load condition         Speed: 11 kts         Full Load Draft: 6'10"         Air Draft: 17'9"         Other: Kedging Anchor and Windlass for self-extraction from beach LCU(R) DESIRED ENHANCED PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS & OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES: (As compared to the existing LCU 1600 series) a. Maximum allowable beam -- 45 feet. b. Maximum allowable length -- 130 feet. c. Maximum allowable draft shall not exceed the water depth limitations of the LHD's well deck (i.e., four ft of water in the forward portion of the well and increasing to ten feet at the sill) d. Air draft shall not exceed the air draft of the existing LCU 1600. e. Craft should be capable of carrying three (3) M1A1 tanks from the well deck to the beach. f.

<DESC>This modification is as of 30 Jan 02. The purpose of this modification is to clarify the solicitation. The drawing is for additional information, quotes should be based off of specs listed in this solicitation. A couple of questions arose. The specs call out a balcony on the tower section and drawings show a balcony on residential section. Follow the specs. Next, the roll door can be relocated, but it must not affect training evaluations. Also, instead of two burn rooms in the residential section, there should be one burn room in the residential section and one burn room in the garage section. Again, the drawings do not reflect this. Follow the specs. Please contact SSgt Bendele at 334-953-5528 with any questions. All other terms and conditions remain the same.

The interior work includes, but is not limited to, renovations and alterations to bathrooms, kitchens and screened-in porches.

The estimated cost for design and construction of the project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  Proposals will be evaluated using two-phase source selection procedures that will result in award of a firm-fixed price design/build contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is the ?best value? to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to a maximum of five (5) offerors (design-build firms or teams) based on design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications, Scheduling and Management Approach.  Only those offerors selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the competitive field will be required to submit technical and price proposals for the project.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution for the project; Small Business Subcontracting Effort; and other factors that define the quality of management, design, construction.  Price proposals will include total evaluated price, such as, base proposal, options, and evaluation of scope/design options within the Government?s published budget for award.  The Government reserves the right to: reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; negotiate with any or all offerors; award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated; and award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.  PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVUALUATE PROPOSALS AND SELECT PHASE II OFFERORS WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms.  Proposers should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-FY02dirtest
<RESPDATE>021402
<ARCHDATE>03012002
<CONTACT>Phyllis Porter, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-965-9549, Fax 410-965-9560, Email phyllis.porter@ssa.gov - Wayne Mcdonald, Contract Specialist, Phone 4109659480, Fax 4109659560, Email wayne.mcdonald@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Agency plans to implement Active Directory design as a replacement for current NT Domain structure.  Active Directory is a new service within the Windows 2000 to .Net operating systems.  It will become the enterprise directory service to manage users, computers, and other resources.  Active Directory is the core for Microsoft networking services such as security (authentication and access control) email (Exchange 2000) and name resolution (DNS). 

 Active Directory implementation will replace multiple directories used in the Agency?s current NT environment.  Implementing Active Directory at SSA will create a global, multi-master database that can be used by the advanced operating systems and Active Directory-enabled applications (such as Exchange ? SSA?s email system). The operational performance of the Active Directory will be paramount to all entities using it.  Therefore it must be well designed, effectively implemented, and adequately supported by the underlying infrastructure to assure acceptable operational performance.

Social Security Administration (SSA) requires expert services to conduct performance testing and analysis of a proposed Windows 2000 Active Directory design within a lab environment.  SSA requires sound assessment and metrics of how AD will perform once in production. These services will be to design, setup and test various scenarios and eliminate as many unknowns as possible before committing recommended performance / capacity changes to design of the production infrastructure. 

Therefore, SSA?s requirement is for expert services in Windows 2000 Active Directory performance testing with a first-hand knowledge of the proposed design as well as comprehensive knowledge of SSA?s current NT network infrastructure.  Offeror must be capable of making recommendations for enhancing performance of the proposed design and should consider Design alternatives and Cost-effectiveness.

The respondent must be capable of establishing a Lab environment to simulate SSA?s proposed Windows 2000 Active Directory design (or a portion of it) for the SSA Production Environment.  Expert services are sought for, but not limited to, the following:  (1) Priority list of tests, (2) Traffic metrics typical users / applications actions, (3) Capacity Planning, (4) Performance benchmarks, and 5) Prepare Scripts.

SSA is seeking a vendor than can provide recommendations on the additional equipment required as the result of a proposed production design.  Vendor must be capable of Identifying and evaluating available and future technologies and designs such as, but not limited to, QoS, Directory Services Placement, Replication Topologies, and Performance Tuning Measures. 

The Social Security Administration is planning to upgrade its current Windows NT 4.0 architecture to the next version of the Windows operating system.  SSA intends to implement the latest version of the Windows operating system (the Windows 2000 to ?.NET? family).  Proper planning should lead to sound Windows 2000 Active Directory capacity and performance.   

The tools and techniques for selecting, designing, setting up, executing and analyzing results of the priority list tests are part and parcel of the expert services sought.  Retaining SSA access to the cadre of tools and scripts and reporting templates used by the contractor for the testing and analysis is another.  

Any responsible firm that feels it has the capability to provide the above listed requirements may respond in writing no later than February 14, 2002 with capability statements and information describing in full detail their capabilities to accomplish SSA?s objective.

FAXED RESPONSES ARE NOT PERMITTED.  Questions concerning this announcement may be submitted via email.  This not a request for quotations.  The Government does not intend to pay for information provided in response to this announcement; respondents should refer to AVPMMY600.  The =size limitation for email attachments is five megabytes per individual=email message.  The SSA utilizes Microsoft Word 97 as the standard= word processing software.

<SUBJECT>67 -- Request For Information about Corona Monitoring Cameras Designed for Use Near High Voltage/High Current, Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) Exposure
<SOLNBR>SSC-San Diego MKTSVY 1467A
<RESPDATE>030102
<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Lisa A Draves, Contract Specialist, 619-553-8477
<DESC>The US Navy operates 10 high power Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) shore based transmitting stations that support strategic communications. An integral part of these transmitting stations are the tuning components such as load inductors that are constructed using expensive Litz wire. The very nature of high power signal transmission necessitates the use of very high voltages. These voltages can, under certain circumstances subject these inductors to damaging corona. A corona monitoring camera that can operate during daylight is sought that would enable remote viewing/sensing of corona on the energized inductors in the helix tuning house. The camera should offer the following outputs:(1) visible images and (2) visible images superimposed on the detected corona. Early detection of corona will allow the sources of corona to be eliminated before damage can occur that would require the replacement of VLF/LF antenna system components. This announcement is a request for information(RFI). Only responses that offer a non developmental product that is already designed and manufactured are requested. The Fixed Very Low Frequency (FVLF) Program at SPAWAR Systems Center in San Diego (SSC-San Diego) is compiling information about corona monitoring technologies that can be applied to VLF/LF communications. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be issued. However, SPAWAR and the Navy will utilize the information for technical and acquisition planning. It is recognized that cost information that is provided by the contractor is a preliminary estimate for planning purposes; the contractor will not be bound to these estimates. Subsequent acquisitions may follow in the ways that best meet Navy needs. The government invites comments related to possible purchase or acquisition strategies. If there is a GSA or other contract vehicle already available for the technology being proposed, please include this information in the response. All data received in response to this RFI marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be fully protected from release outside the government. It is not the intent of SSC-SD to reimburse providers for the cost of submitting information in response to this RFI. Please direct any questions via e-mail to the POC, Mrs. Lisa Draves ldraves@spawar.navy.mil). To be beneficial, interested parties should submit any applicable information by 2002 MAR 01 via electronic transmission by utilizing the "Submit Company Info" link above.

<DESC>NA This FedBizOps announcement is a notice that TriCare Region 6, 7, & 8 which includes all Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF’s) in the states of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Colorado, Arizona, Kansas, Missouri, Idaho, Oklahoma, New Mexico, North Dakota, Monta na, Nebraska, Nevada, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming are in the standardization process for the product lines of Safety Scalpels, Safety Butterfly and IV devices, Safety needles (detachable and stand alone). The intent of the standardization program is to  establish regionally preferred sources for hospital supply items to standardize purchasing of products for these MTF’s. Clinical Product Teams (CPT) will evaluate this product line. Teams are composed of physicians, nurses and clinicians who have expertis e and knowledge of the products. They will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted. TriCare Region 6, 7 and 8 deems the CPT members to be medical experts. Therefore, they are qualified to determine which products are acceptable. Companies int erested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item requirements. They are as follows: 1) The safety feature can be activated passively or using a one-handed technique. Passive devi ces will be given preference. 2) A clear and unmistakable change (either audible or visible) occurs when the safety feature is activated, 3) The safety feature operates reliably, 4) The exposed sharp is permanently blunted or covered after use and prior to  disposal, 5) Extensive training is not required for the user, 6) Device is latex free, 7) The supplier will provide necessary in-service training (various shifts) for the user, 8) The supplier can provide and assist in a plan of implementation, including a conversion chart to show competitors like items, 9) Vendor product fairs will be required. This is not a Request for Proposal; the purpose of the sources sought notice is to seek commercial sources that will meet the US Government requirements.  Supplier s must be DAPA holders and will be required to conduct clinical trials and provide clinical samples at no cost to the government. If your company currently holds a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for this Medical/Surgical Product Line, your compa ny is eligible to participate in the standardization process. If your company is not a current DAPA holder for this product line, you are still eligible to participate in the standardization process for these regions by contacting the Defense Support Cente r-Philadelphia  (DSCP). Please contact the DAPA contracting officer, Mr. Lou Jennings at (215) 737-2125 for assistance. Your company can be considered for standardization once DAPA paperwork is pending at DSCP. After you have notified the Tri-service Regio nal Business Office (TRBO) that your company wishes to participate, or that your DAPA application is pending with DSCP, your company will be notified prior to the start of the standardization process for this Product Line. If your company can provide any o f these items, please forward samples of all items available from your company that meet the product descriptions and any corresponding product literature to:  Tricare Regional Business Office, Suite 315 7800 IH 10 West, San Antonio, TX. 78230.  Please include a cover letter identifying a point of contact in case we have any questions regarding the product. If the CPT recommends a company, the Tri-service Regional Business Office may request sales data. This information will be treated as propriet ary and not releasable. Companies not submitting samples by the above date may be eliminated from consideration. To participate, please contact the identified Research and Development Analyst electronically with your company’s name, point of contact, and p hone/fax number.  For questions please contact Kevin W.

<DESC>Engineering and design services for two indefinite quantity contracts for the preparation of architectural and engineering studies, plans, specifications, and cost estimates for multi-discipline projects. The preponderance of the work under these contracts is anticipated to occur within the Engineering Field Activity, Northeast, Naval Facilities Engineering Command's area of responsibility including the states of Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont. Work could also be added in the area of responsibility of Atlantic Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command in the states of Virginia, North Carolina and West Virginia as well the Caribbean, the Azores, Iceland, Europe (including Engineering Field Activity, Mediterranean areas). Also, work could be added in the area of responsibility of Engineering Field Activity, Chesapeake including the District of Columbia and the state of Maryland. Additionally, an order could be issued for any Government facility in the world. Contract N62472-02-D-1415 will be used primarily for work in DE, PA, NY and NJ. Contract N62472-02-D-1416 will be used primarily for work in MA, CT, RI, NH, ME, and VT. However, work from any state may be added to either contract at the discretion of the Government. The Naval Facilities Engineering Command is moving towards Design-Build as the preferred method for acquiring capital improvements. Though Design-Bid-Build methodologies (with the preparation of 100% Plans and Specifications) will continue to be utilized, a significant number will likely require preparation of Requests for Proposal packages for Design-Build solicitations using abbreviated (0% - 30%) design documentation. Packages would include elements of site/engineering investigation, architectural programming, and functional/performance specifications. The following services may also be required: facility planning which includes project programming documents (1391 development), development of requirements, preparation of engineering evaluations, project scope, and unit guidance or parametric cost estimating, development of alternatives and economic analysis; analysis of proposed sites for foundations, utilities, access, constraints and identification of environmental issues; facility design/construction packages, design-build Request for Proposal packages, government collateral equipment lists, project preliminary hazard analysis, obtaining permits and regulatory approvals, comprehensive interior design, review of the contractor?s submittals, field consultation and inspection during construction, Title II Inspection, Operation and Maintenance Support Information (OMSI), and as-built drawing preparation. The initial project will be determined at a later date. Projects assigned to this contract may include work in the following specialties: Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Fire Protection, Architectural, Interior Design and Landscape Architecture. Phases and/or pre-priced contract options may be included and will be exercised at the discretion of the government for 0 to 35%, 35 to 100% design, and post construction contract award services. Contract award is contingent on availability of funds. Options are normally exercised within several months of completing prior work; however, delays of up to one year are possible. Some projects will require design in the metric system. As part of this contract, an asbestos and/or lead-based paint assessment may be required to determine the presence of hazardous material during removals/demolition or at utility points of connections. Firms must be able to accept work that involves asbestos, lead paint, PCBs, and other hazardous materials. Work will be prepared utilizing AutoCAD Release 14 or higher or Microstation Version 95 or higher depending on the location of the specific project. Specifications will be prepared using SPECSINSTACT program, and cost estimates using the Success estimating program in a Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) system format will be utilized. Selected firm will be required to provide documents in pdf format for posting to a Government web site during solicitation. Firms are advised that the selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates which design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract. This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents (DD1391), facility siting studies, environmental assessments, or request for proposals for Design-Build projects, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost. The contract requires that the selected firm have on-line access to email via the Internet for exchange of correspondence/information. SIGNIFICANT EVALUATION FACTORS (in order of importance): 1.

<OFFADD>4301 Pacific Highway Bldg OT4 Code 02, San Diego CA 92110-3127
<SUBJECT>Integrated Terminal Program (ITP)
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This request for information does not commit the government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), San Diego is interested in obtaining industry?s perspective on a key initiative for improving satellite communications (SATCOM) capabilities.  SPAWAR will be pursuing an Integrated Terminal Program (ITP) that is intended to reduce total ownership cost, increase readiness, improve flexibility, and ease transition to new technologies.  The responses to this RFI will assist the government in determining a cost and fielding schedule for the ITP.  The ITP concept was introduced to industry at the recently held SPAWAR Industry Day conference. The ITP concept centers on a single terminal capable of receiving and transmitting to at least 3 satellites simultaneously, operating over some combination of the bands Q, X, Ka, Ku and C.  The ITP envisions equipping each ship with 5 parabolic antennas, each able to switch bands instantaneously in response to loss of satellite visibility due to superstructure blockage. Constellations of interest include Advanced Extremely High Frequency, Advanced Wideband Satellite (AWS), and commercial satellites.  Although the ITP concept is centered on 5 parabolic antennas, the government is open to receiving alternative ship integration designs including phased arrays or a combination of parabolic and phased array antennas.  The government has identified several technical challenges that it believes would need to be overcome to achieve the ITP concept.  The challenges are not necessarily all-inclusive and are not in priority order.  Industry is encouraged to identify additional technological challenges or risks associated with the ITP concept.  The government-identified challenges are:  (1) Five Band Antenna Feedhorns.  Under the ITP concept, each parabolic antenna would require a five-band feed.  The dishes would need to maintain the size and weight of existing antennas with comparable performance to existing single-band feeds. Multi-band power amplifiers would have to be developed and installed at the antenna and the increased heat accounted for to prevent component failure and minimize thermal distortion to LNA/LNB components. If five-band feeds are deemed impractical or excessively risky, suggest alternative schemes using single and multi-band feeds, mechanical switching, phased array antennas or any other innovative concept that helps reduce topside requirements.  (2) Certification.  Each antenna is required to meet all applicable space segment certification requirements.  Performance degradation resulting from multiple-band feeds could affect the certification process.  Certifications include DISA, commercial standards such as INTELSAT, and any future certifications not yet known.  (3) RF Switching and Handover Strategy.  A seamless antenna handover process needs to be developed to switch bands instantaneously in response to satellite availability changes due to topside blockage.  Current antenna handover techniques assume a non-prime antenna slaved to a prime antenna in anticipation of a handover event to mitigate non-prime acquisition time.  The ITP concept envisions three simultaneous bands on five antennas and therefore current antenna handover techniques are inadequate.  ITP requires an innovative antenna handover and scheduling strategy to ensure uninterrupted service in the three on-line bands.  A modem independent solution is preferred.  However, any innovative solutions for multi-band handover are desirable.  (4) Radome Radar Cross Section (RCS) and Overpressure Requirements.  Radomes would need to be optimized for 5Ghz to 44Ghz operation while meeting RCS and overpressure requirements.  If radomes covering this entire frequency range are impractical or risky, industry alternatives are encouraged.  (5) Electromagnet ic Interference (EMI).  Currently even single band antennas are difficult to place due to in-band and out-of-band Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) issues. A new antenna design accommodating five bands presents a much more difficult set of EMI issues.  Mitigation techniques such as side and back lobe suppression or noise cancellation techniques are of interest.  (6) Remote Access.  Under the ITP concept, the terminal needs to include the capability of remote access, from the shore or another platform, to perform maintenance, tech assist and monitoring.  Paths for remote access may include in-band signaling, out-of-band signaling, or a baseband path such as through the shipboard IP network.  (7) Open Systems Architecture.  Under the ITP concept, a highly flexible terminal architecture using an open systems architecture, defined interfaces, and modular procurement is highly desirable.
