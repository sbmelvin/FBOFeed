<DESC>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Division of Laboratory Science (DLS), intends to award a sole source purchase order to Hamilton Company, 4970 Energy Way, Reno, NV 89520, for the purchase of 50 HPLC columns, specially made for the lab.<br /><br />The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. <br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase 50 HPLC columns. Hamilton Company is the only responsible source capable of meeting the Government's requirement because they can manufacture these columns that meet CDC's specification for the arsenic speciation method. The composition of the column is a critical component of the performance requirements needed for this analytical method and it cannot be varied. These columns allow for the achievement of the needed scientific separation among species and these columns are rugged enough to withstand the matrix that scientists analyze on a routing basis. The lab was able to analyze more samples with these specially made columns than other columns that were tested. They also obtained higher quality results with these columns. Continuity of the requested columns is vital to the established analytical method. Thus, Hamilton Company, the manufacturer of these standards, is the only company that can be used. <br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Hamilton Company. However, firms that believe they can meet these requirements are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice by providing a capability statement to the Contracting Officer by May 11, 2012. The Contracting Officer will not respond to verbal request. All requests must be in writing. <br /><br />A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries shall be sent to Vallerie Redd by email at gfj3@cdc.gov and reference solicitation number 2012-Q-14524 on the subject line.

The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. <br /><br />The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase 600 vials of Trypsin Gold, Mass Spectrometry Grade, packed in 100 ug vials. Promega Corporation is the only responsible source capable of meeting the Government's requirement because they are the only vendor that can manufacture this product, meeting the required specifications (purity and size of vials). Continuity of this product's brand is vital to the continuity of the project activities. If CDC changes brands of Trypsin the existing analytical methods will require a complete evaluation of the product and a reevaluation of existing method which would cause delays in the continuity of the project.<br /><br />Trypsin Gold, Mass Spectrometry Grade Enzyme is treated with TPCK to avoid self digestion of the enzyme. This enzyme is purified by affinity chromatography for best quality and specificity and it is provided as a powder for stability and storage purposes in vials of 100 micrograms. The product, which is currently in use, has been of consistent quality, efficiency and reliability to the point that it became part of CDC's Standard Operating Procedures for protein digestion. <br /><br />Promega is the only manufacturer that provides the Trypsin Gold Mass Spectrometry grade in vials of 100 microgram, specifically designed for assay needs for the CDC and meets all program requirements. Thus, it is the only company that can be used. <br /><br />As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. However, firms that believe they can meet these requirements are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notice by providing a capability statement to the Contracting Officer by May 11, 2012.

SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS:

CONTRACT FOR FEDERAL LOGISTICS DATA ON PORTABLE MEDIA (FED LOG) 
DLA Logistics Information Service Mission - The DLA Logistics Information Service is a component
activity of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).  DLA Logistics Information Service provides logistics information and Information Technology (IT) solutions for the Military Services, other Defense Department and Federal Agencies, Government Contractors, private industry and international partners to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of supply chain management.  DLA Logistics Information Service delivers information to customers in a variety of media and formats based on the customers data requirements and IT and network resources and capabilities.

FED LOG is the primary product produced and delivered by DLA Logistics Information Service.  FED LOG has been produced by the DLA Logistics Information Service since 1992.  It provides logistics information on CD-ROM and DVD.  Information includes management data, part numbers, reference numbers, and information about suppliers, freight, packaging, and interchangeable parts from the FLIS.  FLIS is the enterprise database for item-related data for the Federal Government.  In addition to FLIS, FED LOG provides item-related data unique to the military services.  Attachment 1 provides detailed information about the FED LOG product.

This contract is for the publication and dissemination of logistics data on portable media.  The Contractor shall be responsible for all aspects of the solution to provide this service including such requirements as: Product Preparation, Product Delivery, Providing Quality Assurance, Information Assurance (which includes controlling access), Customer Support, Program Management, and Software, Product, and Concept Development.  Contract execution includes creation, management, sustainment and upgrading/enhancing the program as needed to fulfill the requirements of the PWS.

These tasks include data extraction, translation and compression to create a searchable application/database to be used on portable media.  Disc mastering, replication and order fulfillment are also included.

Agile Mobile Media (AMM) is the current process used to compress, index and master data for FED LOG and other CD/DVD products using the same executable file.  The data displays are controlled by definition files, so they can be added, altered, or deleted easily by simply changing the respective definition file.  The Contractor has the option of using and maintaining the existing AMM software, or developing comparable production software.  If the Contractor elects to utilize the existing AMM software/process, it is understood that the Government is not responsible to provide training or instruction on the AMM software or production process.  It will be the responsibility of the Contractor to understand and utilize AMM.

This contract encompasses all activities necessary to continue production of the FED LOG product, and the additional products. It also provides for the improvement of the existing products, development of future products, and the adaptation of technology to more effectively and efficiently deliver supply logistics information for use in U.S. Military and other Government logistics operations and supply chain management.

For the purpose of this contract Additional Products are defined as the non-FED LOG portable media products made or supported for DLA Logistics Information Service using the same production process. These products currently include: Publicly Available Logistics Data on Portable Media (PUB LOG), Army Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Surcharge, Unique Item Tracking (UIT), Weapons Systems,  and Energy.  PUB LOG is a subset of FED LOG data and will include Characteristics data, Demil data, Master Cross Reference Data (MCRD), Management  Interchangeability and Substitutability information, and Freight Data.  PUB LOG will also include H-Series information and the FLIS Procedures manual

FED LOG is an application subordinate to the Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS) Portfolio Certification and Accreditation Package rated Mission Assurance Category (MAC II) providing sensitive/ For Official Use Only (FOUO) data. SENSITIVE applications under this Performance Work Statement (PWS) must meet either MAC II or MAC III Information Assurance (IA) controls listed in the DOD 8500.2, Attachments A2 and A5, or Attachments A3 and A5, respectively apply.

The disposal certificate will clearly indicate that all waste has been properly disposed of and will specify the site and date of disposal or incineration (90 day requirement).  Exceptions to this must be approved by the COTR. 

e. All manifests, waste determinations, waste generation data, shipping information and other data required for the proper execution of this contract will be maintained by the contractor in an electronic database format that is exportable through a Microsoft Excel format for input into the VA system.

Any solicitation resulting from this notice will be handled in accordance with FAR 5.102(d); therefore, availability of any resulting solicitation package will be limited to this electronic medium. <br />Subject to the availability of funds, the United States Agency for International Development Mission to the Philippines (USAID/Philippines) intends to issue a request for proposal (RFP) in order to select a contractor to implement the Scaling Innovations in Mobile Money (SIMM) Project. The two-year SIMM Project will build upon current interventions in microenterprise access and mobile banking (m-banking) to expand financial services through new technologies that will boost the expansion and rapid adoption of mobile-money (m-money) services. It will create an enabling environment for m-money and increase financial inclusion for broad-based economic growth. To reach these goals, SIMM will target three broad areas of strategic intervention: (i) the payment system, (ii) government services, and (iii) electronic payroll (e-Payroll) distribution. Cutting across these strategic areas, the activities of SIMM will also address both supply and demand constraints to broader adoption of m-money in the Philippines and will promote global knowledge sharing.<br />It is envisioned that the project team will be composed of an expatriate Chief of Party, local national Mobile Financial Services, ICT and Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Specialists and an Activity Manager.<br />

<SUBJECT>Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Enterprise-Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE) - Dynamic Access Control Framework
<SOLNBR>HC1028-12-R-0044
<CONTACT>Trevor K Whitaker, Contract Specialist, Phone 618-229-9234, Fax 618-229-9174, Email trevor.whitaker@disa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Enterprise-Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE) has a principal mission to provide architectural, systems engineering, and analytical support for the End-to-End (E2E) interoperability standards and technical implementation guidance development for DISA, the Department of Defense Chief Information Officer (DoD CIO), and other Global Information Grid (GIG) stakeholders to ensure effective and functionally integrated capabilities across the GIG in support of DoD business, warfighter mission and intelligence requirements.
<p>Specifically, the DoD CIO has identified Identity and Access management (IdAM) as the foundation for accessing future information services. The need for a consistent real time dynamic access control capability for DoD is identified as one of the DoD top Information Technology (IT) priorities. Multiple IdAM frameworks exist within the Federal government and DoD but have fragmented lexicons and interface definitions. There is a need for a synchronized framework with a focus on architectures and implementation guides that define the common services and interfaces. These documents will facilitate the development and implementation of a DoD wide dynamic access control capability.</p>
<p>Prior work by the EWSE GIG Authentication and Access Control (GAAC) Integrated Product Team (IPT) started addressing the issue with a Dynamic Access Control Framework white paper that provided a recommended lexicon and ontology. These definitions provided a framework for organizing the access control issues and a basis for future work. The objective of this task is to leverage this and other prior work to further develop technical architecture artifacts and implementation guidance.</p>
<p>This requirement is sponsored by DISA/EWSE to develop various architecture artifacts and implementation guides and to conduct the supporting engineering analyses. In some cases, implementation guidance may be formulated and submitted as formal guidance known as a GIG Technical Profile (GTP). The scope and primary focus of these products will be organized around various topics areas derived from the "Access Control Framework GTP" and other sources. These include:</p>
<p>1) Access Control Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) / Policy Decision Point (PDP) Architecture,<br />2) Domain Attribute Service,<br />3) Access Control Policy Store/Service,<br />4) Directory Services for Authorization.</p>
<p>The artifacts associated with these areas are intended to support the transition from the current, disparate "as-is" access control implementations towards a "to-be" converged enterprise service which provides service interfaces to support both communities of interest (COIs) as well as autonomous systems and domains. An additional objective is developing artifacts that facilitate dynamic access control transition and implementation. Among the cases to be supported is the transition from local access, such as a single COI, reliant on identity based access control (IBAC) or role based access control (RBAC) methods, towards access control using an enterprise level service using a combination of attribute based (ABAC) and policy based access control (PBAC) methods.</p>
<p>The work will involve review and analysis of relevant existing and emerging policy, implementations, architectures, concept papers and requirements. The work will also involve synthesis and technical analysis of candidate technical approaches to potentially include modeling and simulation and the development of recommended dynamic access control architectures and implementation guidance. Review of existing literature, coordination and technical exchange with other related efforts within the DoD and Federal Government, and application of subject matters expertise will be required.</p>
<p>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.203, the Government intends for this acquisition to be offered for competition limited to eligible Small Business Concerns. This procurement will be 100% set-aside for Small Business Concerns. The period of performance will be one year from contract award with one (1) one-year option. The estimated start date is 10 September 2012. The National American Industrial Classification Standard (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541512. The solicitation and all related documents will be posted at this site. Instructions for submitting questions and proposals will be given at the time the solicitation is released. The resulting award will be Best Value Trade-Off, with non-cost factors being significantly more important than cost. If at anytime the Government determines that the requested services are no longer required, the Government reserves the right to not make an award. The Government also reserves the right to award without discussions. Proposals will be due after Request for Proposal (RFP) release date. All responses from responsible Small Business Concerns will be considered for evaluation and award of the contract. Oral communications are not acceptable. All inquiries regarding this requirement shall be submitted electronically and directed to Trevor Whitaker, Contracting Specialist, at trevor.whitaker@disa.mil.</p>
<p>The estimated date in which the Request for Proposal (RFP) for this acquisition to be uploaded to FedBizOpps is 11 May 2012.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) / SOURCES SOUGHT (SS) NOTICE<br>Development of Spectrum Monitoring and Power Control for All Digital Terminal<br><br><br>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A SOLICITATION.<br>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as an invitation for bid, request for quotation, request for proposal, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy, or performance work statements, or performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.<br><br>INTRODUCTION<br><br>The US Army Communications Electronics Research & Development Engineering Center (CERDEC) Space & Terrestrial Communications Directorate (STCD) is interested in receiving information from companies that have experience in the design, development, and implementation of wideband military satellite communications systems, real time/embedded systems, spectrum monitoring solutions, and link power control solutions.  CERDEC STCD wishes to identify potential sources for the development and implementation of a spectrum monitoring and power control concept and methodology for an intermediate frequency all-digital satellite communications terminal.<br><br>CERDEC STCD initiated a technology development program, Future Advanced SATCOM Technologies (FAST), in FY 12.  FAST will develop a suite of technology demonstrating the implementation of an all-digital SATCOM terminal at a common intermediate frequency, along with associated digital subsystems and applications. This includes the potential for enhanced satellite resource management and control capabilities.<br><br>BACKGROUND<br><br>Current SATCOM Earth Terminal (ET) communications are implemented using an analog architecture, with conversion from digital data to analog signal occurring in the modem.  The FAST architecture moves the analog portion of the ET architecture closer to the antenna, and implements a number of formerly analog functions using a digital architecture. The concept is to digitize the full receive spectrum at Intermediate Frequency (IF) and digitally process to provide separate digital interfaces to the modems.

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND<br />The Office of Afghanistan/Pakistan Programs (INL/AP) is part of the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) in the Department of State. The Bureau is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State (DOS). INL/AP provides policy guidance and develops, executes and monitors programs to address the full range of counternarcotics issues as they relate to stabilization and reconstruction activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan. INL has been engaged in an effort with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to ensure a comprehensive approach to the drug problem. The U.S. Counternarcotics Strategy for Afghanistan targets narcotics traffickers through interdiction, while also supporting agricultural development, eradication, demand reduction, public information, and rule of law programs. The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has been designated the lead agency within the DOS to hire, fund, and manage the Ministry of Counter Narcotics Advisor and Ministry of Interior Counternarcotics Division liaison.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The Senior Counternarcotics (CN) Ministry Advisor is treated as a member of the inner staff of the Ministry of Counter Narcotics (MCN) and Ministry of Interior CN Division (MOI/CN), Kabul, Afghanistan. The Senior Counternarcotics Advisor would provide expertise in a wide variety of settings, including internal U.S. embassy and multi-national meetings, to assist the Government of Afghanistan in reaching its stated goals and objectives in advancing and reforming counternarcotics programs in Afghanistan. S/he would offer assistance in a variety of areas, to include counternarcotics policy development and coordination with the interagency and international community and counternarcotics program development, management, and oversight.</p>
<p>Relationships <br />Supervisory Controls: The incumbent will report to the Director of the INL Section at U.S. Embassy Kabul through the INL Kabul Counternarcotics Team Leader. Tasking will come from both INL/Kabul and INL's Afghanistan and Pakistan Program Office in Washington. The incumbent's actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations. Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.</p>
<p>Level of Effort: Hours for this full-time position will be the core hours of U.S. Embassy Kabul: 8:30am to 5:30pm Sunday through Thursday with a minimum of fifty-five hours per week.</p>
<p>Travel and Position Location: The position is located in Kabul. Frequent travel in and around Afghanistan is likely. All movements within Afghanistan will be covered by the U.S. Military and/or the INL air wing and motor pool assets, and all travel outside of Afghanistan will be covered by commercial airlines.</p>
<p>Pre-deployment support for the Afghanistan-based Advisor: The advisor will be required to attend two (2) weeks of basic familiarization training at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington D.C. prior to deployment.</p>
<p>Life Support: Life support for the Advisor will be provided by other USG service providers and is not to be included in this task order proposal. INL will provide the incumbent with access to the Embassy compound. The incumbent will have access to hardened and/or regular cars (exact type will be dependent on security situation) from motor pool for transportation around Kabul. Housing will be assigned by the Embassy's Management Office in coordination with INL Kabul.</p>
<p><br />B. STATEMENT OF WORK<br />&bull; Assist GIRoA in strategic planning and implementing Afghan Government CN policy, with a special focus on improving and expanding U.S. supported programs, including (but not limited to) the Counternarcotics Police of Afghanistan, Ministry of Counter Narcotics Capacity Building, Good Performers Initiative (GPI), the Counter Narcotics Public Information Campaign (CNPI), the Annual Opium Survey project, and Governor Led Eradication.</p>
<p>&bull; Consult with and provide advice to senior ministry officials on capacity building, management, and oversight needs.</p>
<p>&bull; Inform the ministry officials of developments in U.S. CN policy and advise on its implications for GIRoA.</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as a continuous link between MCN or MOI and the INL Section of U.S. Embassy Kabul; submit regular written reports to INL Kabul on substantive CN issues and management issues.</p>
<p>&bull; Identify opportunities for GIRoA and USG assistance and collaboration, including opportunities to integrate counternarcotics elements, especially the CNPA, into existing development, rule of law and other projects.</p>
<p>&bull; Focus on long-term sustainment of CN law enforcement programs, systems, and institutions provided by foreign donors and the transfer of responsibility to the Government of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&bull; Support the ministry in distinguishing between broad, policy-level objectives on CN matters and specific, programmatic actions that can be realistically achieved by the ministry within its existing or gradually-improving capacity, emphasizing the importance of both long-term planning as well as steady and incremental - rather than immediate - growth in programmatic oversight and implementation.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the formulation and implementation of policies/programs at the regional and local levels.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the ministry to streamline, clarify, and amplify public communication of its policies, programs, and achievements, and support the ministry in clarifying its goals for institutional training and capacity-building along these lines.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the formulation and implementation of policies/programs, including the 2012 National Drug Control Strategy revision.</p>
<p>&bull; Assist the ministry in forging policy-level and programmatic linkages with other Afghan institutions involved in CN activities, including the Ministries of Agriculture, Public Health, and Reconstruction and Rural Development, and with the Independent Directorate for Local Governance.</p>
<p>&bull; Support and help advance the Ministry of Counter Narcotics' mandate, under Afghan law, to regularly receive, monitor, and evaluate statistics and data from all relevant government institutions regarding programs that support implementation of the National Drug Control Strategy, and, where possible, assist government institutions to improve such reporting to the Ministry of Counter Narcotics.<br />&bull; Build and maintain open lines of communication with Afghan, U.S., and international stakeholders on CN activities including: stakeholders from DEA, CENTCOM, other USG agencies, non-governmental organizations, the United Nations and other international organizations, ISAF, the United Kingdom Embassy, representatives of the U.S. military, and other coalition forces. Work collaboratively and effectively with senior leadership and colleagues from other countries, agencies, and departments to accomplish INL's goals and objectives.</p>
<p>&bull; Inform INL on current developments in a given portfolio that must be consulted in advance of important briefings, meetings, or presentations of new initiatives.</p>
<p>&bull; Produce a brief written weekly report on status of programs, activities, and initiatives to be disseminated via email to designated points of contact at INL Kabul, and INL/AP on a mutually agreed upon day of the week. Upon reporting to post, propose a format for this report, which should include, but is not limited to: recent and planned activities, accomplishments, challenges, proposed solutions, administrative issues, and upcoming schedule (to include TDYs and leave). Photographs may be included, as well.</p>
<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>Guidelines consist of various letters of authorization and memoranda of understanding between the U.S. Government and the Government of Afghanistan, as well as existing federal regulations, Department of State policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account.</p>
<p>Complexity<br />Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of INL policies and programs, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. military and the Government of Afghanistan can be complicated. The work horizon of this position is one year; the incumbent must actively plan activities twelve months into the future. Active planning involves anticipating future events and requirements, deciding or recommending what needs to be done, the people and other resources required, and the timing of the activities. <br />Operating within the country strategy, the incumbent will have ongoing opportunity to develop new ideas and approaches that impact on existing procedures and methods. The incumbent must absorb and understand a large volume of detailed information on policies and procedures for multiple disciplines. Within a loose framework, the incumbent will be responsible for meeting a series of mid-to-long term objectives through structuring work and resources. Often breaking new ground, this role will be highly complex and will require a highly developed analytical ability and judgment. The problems encountered in this position are often unique, highly complex, or conceptual. Covering a wide range of potentially conflicting issues, the incumbent must apply the highest analytical skill and judgment to determine the best solution from the range of possible alternatives. The work pattern will be typified by many different overlapping tasks with heavy disruption due to changes in priorities, external events, and other interruptions<br />The incumbent will interface primarily with mid and high-level officers inside the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and other international representatives at PRTs, civilian, and military platforms in Afghanistan. The nature of the contact with embassy officers will be highly demanding, requiring the transfer of complex ideas and concepts. The incumbent will interact primarily with high-level GIRoA, and international officials, including Ministers and Deputy Ministers. The nature of the contact will normally be routine, although often escalating to complex as competing/conflicting interests and security threats are encountered.<br />A broad range of highly developed oral communication skills are required for this position. The incumbent will, at various times, be required to transmit routine information, discuss sensitive matters with tact and diplomacy, provide complex explanations, persuade and influence, give formal presentations, express care and compassion, provide reasoned arguments, and resolve conflicts without compromising the organization's position. Finally, the incumbent must exercise leadership by staff, in order to achieve objectives and get the job done well, quickly, and efficiently without recourse to close supervision or coercion.</p>
<p>Physical Demands</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the work is principally sedentary, however frequent travel in and around Afghanistan is likely. Site visits include physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances, and thus the individual requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Extended onsite visits to remote project sites may rarely be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.</p>
<p>C. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS<br />. U.S. citizenship, eligible for a State Department Secret security clearance and medical clearance.</p>
<p>b. The incumbent should possess a university degree in a field related to the primary duties of this position. Examples of relevant fields include: International Affairs, International Development, Law Enforcement/Criminal Justice, Political Science or Public Administration; South/Southwest Asia, Middle East, Asian or Islamic Studies; Business Administration and/or finance; and Development Economics. A master's degree is preferred but not required.<br />c. A total of five years of professional work experience directly related to one or more of the fields related to the primary duties of the position: program management, international development, public diplomacy/public information campaigns, agriculture or alternative livelihood assistance. NOTE: A SECURITY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND ALONE IS INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENT OF THIS POSITION. <br />d. Prior experience in foreign capacity building or with law enforcement training is preferred, but not required. <br />e. International experience is required; experience in Afghanistan or Iraq preferred. <br />f. Knowledge Areas<br />i. The incumbent must quickly acquire a detailed knowledge of INL programs, civilian and military planning, and applications to GIRoA and USG counternarcotics goals. The incumbent will be expected to give detailed advice on how these areas operate.<br />ii. The incumbent must quickly acquire a detailed knowledge of the political situation; social, cultural, religious, economic, and legal frameworks; security situation; and the agricultural, infrastructural (roads, bridges, irrigation, etc.), counternarcotics strategy in his/her geographic area of assignment.<br />iii. The incumbent should possess, at the time of assignment, detailed knowledge of at least one (but preferably at least two) of the following fields: counternarcotics policy, counternarcotics-related law enforcement, justice sector development, public information, agriculture livelihood development, economic livelihood development, alternative livelihood development, and/or drug demand reduction/treatment.<br />iv. Specialist knowledge may have been acquired through extensive training in the specialist area(s), through a considerable amount of work experience in the field, or a combination of the two. Due to this background, the incumbent will be influential within the entire program and will likely provide detailed advice to non-specialist and other specialists.<br />g. Any degree of fluency in Pashto or Dari is desired, as is experience in working with an interpreter.<br />h. A range of written communication skills are required for this position. The incumbent will, at various times, be required to transmit routine information to other international advisors through e-mail and fax, discuss sensitive matters with tact and diplomacy with the international community in both formal and informal letters and e-mails, as well as provide complex explanations, persuade and influence, and resolve conflicts in a written format without compromising the organization's position. <br />III. POSITION ELEMENTS<br />Supervisory Controls: The incumbent will report to the Director of the INL Section at U.S. Embassy Kabul through the INL Kabul Counternarcotics Team Leader. Tasking will come from both INL/Kabul and INL's Afghanistan and Pakistan Program Office in Washington. The incumbent's actions, decisions and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations. Because the incumbent receives only general policy guidance, he/she must constantly depend on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.</p>
<p>Level of Effort: Hours for this full-time position will be the core hours of U.S. Embassy Kabul: 8:30am to 5:30pm Sunday through Thursday with a minimum of fifty-five hours per week.</p>
<p>Travel and Position Location: The position is located in Kabul. Frequent travel in and around Afghanistan is likely.

STATEMENT OF WORK<br />&bull; Serve as the lead capacity building advisor at MCN, providing oversight and management of all INL-supported expat and Afghan capacity building advisors embedded in the Ministry. <br /><br />&bull; Working with Afghan MCN partners, create a Results Framework for this capacity-building project, which will build consensus around objectives and approaches; ensure that implementers, beneficiaries and stakeholders share a common understanding of how the project will achieve its objectives; and serve as the foundation for the project work plan and Performance Monitoring Plan (PMP).</p>

<p>&bull; Provide training, mentoring and technical support to Afghan Ministry partners on government administration and finance functions, with a special focus on internal audits, finance, human resources, and procurement and logistics infrastructure<br />. <br />&bull; Support MCN in distinguishing between broad, policy-level objectives on CN matters and specific, programmatic actions that can be realistically achieved by the ministry within its existing or gradually-improving capacity, emphasizing the importance of both long-term planning as well as steady and incremental - rather than immediate - growth in programmatic oversight and implementation.</p>
<p>&bull; Support and help advance the Ministry of Counter Narcotics's mandate, under Afghan law, to regularly receive, monitor, and evaluate statistics and data from all relevant government institutions regarding programs that support implementation of the National Drug Control Strategy, and, where possible, assist government institutions to improve such reporting to the Ministry of Counter Narcotics.</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as a continuous link between MCN and the INL Section of U.S. Embassy Kabul; submit regular written reports to INL Kabul on substantive CN issues and capacity building issues.</p>
<p>&bull; Build and maintain open lines of communication with Afghan, U.S. and international stakeholders on CN programs, including stakeholders from USAID and other U.S. Government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the United Nations, the UK Embassy, ISAF, and representatives of the U.S. military and other coalition forces.</p>
<p>&bull; Identify opportunities for assistance and collaboration, including opportunities to integrate counternarcotics elements into existing development, rule of law, or other CN-related projects.</p>
<p>&bull; Draft reports and cables as directed by the U.S. Embassy-Kabul, detailing pertinent activities in the counternarcotics sector.</p>
<p>&bull; Work effectively under pressure, within short time constraints, and during times of rapidly developing events.</p>
<p>&bull; Inform INL of new developments in the portfolio and consult with INL in advance of important briefings, meetings, or presentations of new initiatives.</p>

Upon reporting to post, propose a format for this report, which should include, but is not limited to: recent and planned activities, accomplishments, challenges, proposed solutions, administrative issues, and upcoming schedule (to include TDYs and leave). Photographs may be included, as well.</p>
<p><br />Guidelines</p>
<p>Guidelines consist of various letters of authorization and memoranda of understanding between the U.S. Government and the Government of Afghanistan, as well as existing federal regulations, Department of State policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account.</p>
<p>Complexity<br />The incumbent will develop tailored plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of MCN policies and programs. Assessing the current capacity of MCN, the incumbent will provide training, mentoring and technical support on government administration and finance functions. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. military and the Government of Afghanistan can be complicated. The work horizon of this position is one year; the incumbent must actively plan organization needs twelve months into the future. Active planning involves anticipating future events and requirements, deciding or recommending what needs to be done, the people and other resources required, and the timing of the activities. <br />Operating within the country strategy, the incumbent will have ongoing opportunity to develop and assess new ideas and approaches that impact how the MCN functions. The incumbent must absorb and understand a large volume of detailed information on policies and procedures for multiple disciplines and how that will impact MCN capacity. The work pattern will be typified by many different overlapping tasks with heavy disruption due to changes in priorities, external events, and other interruptions, the incumbent must be flexible in shifting priorities and anticipate infrastructure needs.</p>
<p>Physical Demands</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the work is principally sedentary, however frequent travel in and around Afghanistan is likely. While on a site visit there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances - the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships. Extended onsite visits to remote project sites may rarely be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain. Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult. Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s). Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required. Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult. Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.</p>
<p>C. MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS<br />a. U.S. citizenship, eligible for a State Department Secret security clearance and medical clearance.</p>
<p>b. The incumbent should possess a university degree in a field related to the primary duties of this position, however five or more years of relevant field experience involving capacity building work in Afghanistan or a post-conflict environment is a suitable substitute for a university degree. Examples of relevant fields include: International Affairs, International Development, Law Enforcement/Criminal Justice, Political Science or Public Administration; South/Southwest Asia, Middle East, Asian or Islamic Studies; Business Administration and/or finance; and Development Economics. <br />c. A minimum of 3 years experience living and working in developing countries, preferably as part of major donor-funded civil society or governance programs in an emerging democracy, conflict zone, and/or in Central Asia. NOTE: A SECURITY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND ALONE IS INSUFFICIENT TO MEET THE EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENT OF THIS POSITION. <br />d. Significant professional experience tailoring and employing organization needs assessment tools, and addressing and implementing capacity building approaches and interventions. <br />e. International experience is required; experience in Afghanistan or Iraq strongly preferred. <br />f. Knowledge Areas<br />i. The incumbent must quickly acquire a detailed knowledge of INL programs, civilian and military planning, and applications to GIRoA and USG counternarcotics goals. The incumbent will be expected to give detailed advice on how these areas operate.<br />ii. The incumbent must quickly acquire a detailed knowledge of the political situation; social, cultural, religious, economic, and legal frameworks; security situation; and the agricultural, infrastructural (roads, bridges, irrigation, etc.), counternarcotics strategy in his/her geographic area of assignment.<br />iii. The incumbent should possess, at the time of assignment, detailed knowledge of at least one (but preferably at least two) of the following fields: counternarcotics policy, counternarcotics-related law enforcement, justice sector development, public information, finance, program management, business administration, public administration, agriculture livelihood development, economic livelihood development, alternative livelihood development, and/or drug demand reduction/treatment.<br />iv. The incumbent should possess, at the time of assignment, detailed knowledge of evidence-based capacity building and training models, and demonstrated familiarity with internationally recognized best practices in capacity building. <br />g. Any degree of fluency in Pashto or Dari is desired, as is experience in working with an interpreter.<br />h. A range of written and oral communication skills are required for this position. The incumbent will, at various times, be required to transmit routine information to other international advisors through e-mail and fax, discuss sensitive matters with tact and diplomacy with the international community in both formal and informal letters and e-mails, as well as provide complex explanations, persuade and influence, and resolve conflicts in a written format without compromising the organization's position.</p>
<p>D. EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />Factor 1 Ability to provide capacity building and development expertise to the Embassy and INL. 20 points</p>
<p>Factor 2 Experience and ability to assess current programs, and assist in developing and implementing performance plans in critical needs areas. 20 points</p>
<p>Factor 3 Ability to liaise with members of relevant USG agencies, host nation representatives, and the international community in developing and coordinating CN programs. 15 points</p>

<CONTACT>Vivian Lucas, Phone 3018270359, Email vivian.lucas@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), intends to issue a solicitation to obtain services from a contractor to identify for FDA/CTP, data that may enhance existing methods used in working with States and territories to monitor retailer compliance activities <br /><br />This is not a solicitation for proposals. The purpose of this notice is to obtain capability statements regarding the availability and capability of qualified small business sources for the proposed acquisition. Responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a small business set-aside is possible.<br /><br />The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.<br /><br />The FDA intends to solicit request for proposals using the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration.<br /><br /><strong>Background<br /><br /></strong>Tobacco products are responsible for more than 440,000 deaths each year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that approximately 46 million adults smoke cigarettes in the United States, even though this behavior will result in death or disability for half of all regular users. Paralleling this enormous health burden is the economic burden of tobacco use, which is estimated to total $193 billion annually in medical expenditures and lost productivity. Curbing initiation and increasing cessation are critical public health goals. <br /><br />On June 22, 2009, the President signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act) (Public Law 111&#8208;31: 123Stat. 1776) into law. The Tobacco Control Act grants the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) important new authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing and distribution of tobacco products to protect the public health generally and to reduce tobacco use by minors. The Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) oversees the implementation of the Tobacco Control Act.<br /><br />Since retailers are a key audience of the regulation, it is important to undertake effective and efficient monitoring of retailer compliance rates and ensure efficient direction of resources used in compliance inspections to better understand their potential impact on the public's health. Retailers play a major role in protecting the health of America's youth by not selling, marketing, or advertising cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products to underage children and adolescents. It is critical that FDA gather science&#8208;based data to monitor and more fully understand the impact of national, state, and regional data that can be used to determine a tobacco retailer inspection strategy and measure the public health impact in relation to Tobacco Control Act outcomes.<br /><br /><strong>Objective<br /><br /></strong>The purpose of this procurement is to identify for FDA/CTP, data that may enhance existing methods used in working with States and territories to monitor retailer compliance activities; for example, incorporating a risk&#8208;based approach by identifying States whose retailers are considered at higher risk for regulatory violations to more effectively and efficiently direct FDA's compliance efforts.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Statement of Work<br /><br /></strong>The Contractor shall perform the following tasks:
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Task 1: Kick&#8208;off Meeting<br /></span><em>Task 1.1.</em> Following communication from the COR of the notice of award of the contract, the Contractor shall meet with the COR and FDA staff to discuss the proposed work plan and proposed progress schedule..<br /><br /><em>Task 1.2.</em> The Contractor shall prepare and submit a final work plan based on the proposed progress schedule and feedback on the project's clarity, methodology, and expectations. <br /><br /><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Task 2: Literature Review <br /></span></em>The Contractor shall utilize the appropriate social science and related databases, to gather and analyze published literature and peer&#8208;reviewed studies to explore the issue of monitoring retailer compliance and identifying areas for potential enhanced compliance efforts in order to maximize public health. <br /><br /><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Task 3: Development of the Algorithm</span></em> <br />The Contractor will review the existing literature and develop a scientifically&#8208;based strategy that can be utilized as part of FDA/CTP's overall compliance inspection strategy with respect to retailer compliance inspections that will be aimed at maximizing the public health impact. Retailer compliance inspections currently examine areas such as youth access (e.g. sales to minors, impersonal modes of sale), retailer&#8208;based marketing (e.g. sale of flavored cigarettes or sale of cigarettes in less then packs of 20), and may expand to other areas if CTP issues new regulations. <br /><br />CTP should be able to enter various inputs from existing tobacco compliance monitoring data sources into the model and based on the appropriate succession of yes/no or if/then scenarios, use the model as part of CTP's overall compliance inspection strategy.<br /><br />Factors that may be considered in developing the strategy include, but are not limited to:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; -Vendor class (or types of retailers)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Demographics (racial/ethnic composition,, age, educational levels)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Population density (rural, urban)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Retailer density<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; -Proximity to schools<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; -Youth smoking rates<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; -Difference across types of tobacco products<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; -State tobacco-tax policies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; -Previous non-compliance rates in an area (i.e. Synar)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; -State tobacco laws (i.e. States that issue vending machine licenses vs. States&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where&nbsp;they are illegal)<br /><br />The Contractor shall develop a predictive algorithm, to be delivered to CTP, which will recommend what additional data could be collected by CTP to enhance the overall compliance inspection strategy. <br /><br />The algorithm will incorporate data generated from the synthesis of studies from the literature review.

It is for information, planning and market research purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration or its centers. The purpose of this RFI is to help the FDA understand the industry best practices, technical solutions, and sources capable of meeting the FDA's requirements. Specifically, the Government is seeking verification that its requirement is commercially available, determine if there are any questions about the FDA's requirements, determine if industry notes any omissions in the requirements, and information about sources available to meet the FDA's requirements. <br />
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br />8(a) Sources Sought</strong></span></p>
<p>The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice/RFI is to determine the availability and capability of Small Business Administration Certified 8(a) companies.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Background</strong></span></p>
<p>The aim is to identify a qualified contractor who can provide operation and maintenance support for an FDA software program called Phonetic and Orthographic Computer Analysis (POCA) system to include project management and customer services. The POCA system is composed of two applications, POCA Search and Rx Studies. The contractor shall also ensure compliance of these systems to meet the FDA's Office of Information Management (OIM) standards for the FDA Contractor Hosted Data Center (CHDC).</p>
<p>Other optional services that may be required for the applications during the course of the contract are upgrading of Oracle, Visual Studio and Microsoft.net to the version designated by FDA/OIM. The applications may also require upgrading to ensure full compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 standards. Additional optional services may include technical support of the FDA's publically available POCA system, adding new data sources to the POCA search engine system, and if needed, updating the Rx Studies software.</p>
<p>The POCA Search application improves efficiency of FDA safety evaluators' time. The searchable data includes approved and unapproved proprietary names in the prescription and over-the-counter markets. This application has the capability of searching a wide range of data for look-alike and/or sound-alike names that might increase the probability of medication errors for the proposed proprietary name being reviewed. In addition, the application includes the capability to survey drugs and biologic products with their associated strengths, dosing intervals, dosage forms, and routes of administration.</p>
<p>The Rx Studies application allows the OSE Safety Evaluator to design and conduct studies on proposed proprietary names. Handwriting and audio samples are obtained from licensed health professionals. The handwriting samples are scanned and saved as a portable document files (pdf). The audio samples are recorded and saved as audio files. These samples are sent out through the Rx Studies application to volunteer health professionals in the FDA. The volunteers reply to the OSE Safety Evaluator with their interpretations of the proposed proprietary names within the Rx Studies application.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Instructions</strong></span></p>
<p>Interested parties shall provide capability-based responses to the following requested information:</p>
<p>1. Project management activities shall include but are not limited to: directing and coordinating Contractor project staff; monitoring the operation and maintenance, and optional task activities through the development of Project and Acceptance Plans; manage software changes including version control of production and development code sources, and help documentation for users; participating in the OSE POCA Change Control Board (CCB) and the OIM CCB meetings and processes as needed; verifying compliance of work activities with the FDA regulations and standards; facilitating a kick-off meeting within 1 week of award and providing kick-off meeting minutes; providing monthly progress reports; and facilitating weekly status meetings.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">This is a Sources Sought Notice for market research purposes only and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.<br /><br />The Office of Research and Analysis (ORA) in the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) intends to issue a competitive procurement for a contractor to conduct a national Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Nutrition Services and Administration (NSA) Cost Study. Since 1974, WIC has provided nutrition supplementation, nutrition education and counseling, and increased access to health care and social services for pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women; infants; and, children up to the age of five years. WIC is unique among other federal programs in that its Nutrition Services and Administration (NSA) costs are generally presented as a whole, whereas other programs' costs only include the Administration component. A thorough study of WIC NSA costs has not occurred since 2000. Since that study, there have been a number of factors that have affected WIC NSA costs, including deployment of new technology. Examples include:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&bull;&nbsp; Management information systems (MIS), which has eliminated a number of manual processes (e.g., maintaining paper case files, appointment schedules, etc.) and increased staff efficiency. <br /><br />&bull;&nbsp; Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) has replaced paper food instrument systems in a number of States, and <br /><br />&bull;&nbsp; Recent WIC reauthorization legislation mandated EBT implementation in all States by the year 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">FNS needs to know how these changes have affected WIC NSA costs and how they might affect program costs in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The National WIC NSA Costs Study will provide an updated assessment of the types and categories of costs charged to WIC NSA grants, and variation in these costs among State and local agencies. Anticipated objectives and research questions are listed below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>OBJECTIVE 1:</strong> Gather data on the NSA grant system to obtain a detailed and accurate picture of average NSA funds at the National, State/ITO and local level at the level.<br /><br /><strong>Research Questions:<br /></strong><br /><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp; What are national, state/ITO, and local-agency averages for the NSA costs in the categories and subcategories shown in Figure 1. (State and local-agency averages would be grouped into three categories: large, medium, and small, rather than for each individual state/ITO or local agency.)<br /><br /><strong>a.</strong>&nbsp; Administration<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>i.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Program Management&nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ii.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Management<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Certification Costs<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iv.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Management Information Systems<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Food Delivery Systems<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vi.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vendor Management<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vii.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Office and Clinic Facilities<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; viii.</strong>&nbsp;Indirect Costs<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ix.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Training WIC Staff<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Translation Services<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xi.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Transportation services<br /><strong><br />b.</strong> Nutrition Services&nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nutrition Education&nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultants<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Materials<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluation<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Monitoring<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Breastfeeding Support&nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro motion<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consultants<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Materials<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(4) </strong>&nbsp; Evaluation<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; Monitoring<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii.</strong>&nbsp; Client Services&nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referrals to other programs&nbsp;<br /><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Outreach<br /><br /><strong>2.</strong> If a State or local agency charges indirect costs, upon what base (e.g. number of staff, computers, etc.) is the applicable indirect cost rate determined? <br /><br /><strong>3.</strong> How much and what kind of cash and in-kind contributions are being provided to the WIC Program at both the State and local agency levels? <br /><strong><br />4.</strong> Determine the effect that infant formula rebates have on both food and NSA costs. How do the amounts of infant formula rebates affect NSA budgets and expenditures?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>OBJECTIVE 2:</strong> Determine the impact on NSA costs of the increased use of technology.<br /><strong><br />1.</strong> Has the increased use of technology affected efficiencies?<br /><strong><br />2.</strong> Has the increased use of technology impacted staffing budgets?<br /><strong><br />3.</strong> Has the increased use of technology impacted staffing budgets, such as allowing staff to split their time differently between Program, Nutrition Services, and Administrative Costs?<br /><br /><strong>OBJECTIVE 3:</strong> Determine the extent and effect of economies of scale between larger and smaller State/ITOs and local agencies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1.</strong> On what basis do State agencies allocate WIC NSA funding to the State and to their local agencies? (i.e., funding formula, caseload, other)? <br /><strong><br />2.</strong> What factors help determine economies of scale? (e.g., type of agency, such as hospital, county health department, non-profit agency, type of services offered, such as collocated health services, WIC services only, etc.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>OBJECTIVE 4:</strong> Establish comparisons between WIC Administration Costs and Administration Costs in other similar federal programs?<br /><br /><strong>1.</strong> WIC's Nutrition Services and Administration (NSA) costs include both Nutrition Services and Administration. If these categories were separated, how would the Administration costs compare to those in other similar programs, such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Medicaid, and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)? <br /><strong><br />2.</strong> What subcategories do those programs include in their Administrative costs? <br /><strong><br />3.</strong> Do they include Nutrition Services in their Administrative costs?<br /><br /><strong>ANTICIPATED DATA SOURCES<br /></strong><br />The study will likely use survey data, follow up interview data, and potentially document review in local and State WIC agencies. The anticipated data sources are:<br /><br />&bull;&nbsp; Survey Data. The contractor will be responsible for designing a survey with sampling that will provide national averages for NSA costs, as well as averages for States/ITOs and local agencies. The latter two categories will be divided into Large, Medium, and Small categories. <br /><br />&bull;&nbsp; Follow up interviews/document review. The contractor will be responsible for conducting case studies in a subsample of states or local agencies to examine NSA costs in greater detail. These will include interviews with staff and document review to gather information on state and local WIC nutrition services and administration costs.</p>

The Counter-IED (C-IED) effort is a combined Joint Services, interagency, multi-national program designed to leverage all available resources and technologies in a coordinated campaign to eliminate IEDs as weapons of strategic influence. As the DOD lead, JIEDDO must rapidly provide C-IED capabilities in support of the Combatant Commanders. JIEDDO also has the responsibility to track all funding and initiatives in support of the C-IED efforts, whether Attack the Network, Train the Force, or Defeat the Device. This requires a robust internal controls program to ensure the appropriate cheacks and balances are built into JIEDDO's processes and operations. JIEDDO's C-IED mission also requires quick access to the skill sets that will assist the organization make needed improvements to the processes it uses to carry out important mission tasks.</p>
<p>Scope:</p>
<p>The JIEDDO Managers' Internal Controls program identifies and remediates internal control vulnerabilities and process inefficiencies by supporting the internal control efforts of JIEDDO's Management Control Administrators (MCAs), developing and reporting performance metrics for JIEDDO Directorates, and recommending ways in which these processes could be more efficient and effective. JIEDDO's Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) capability provides the means to assist JIEDDO Directorates in implementing these and other improvement recommendations while at the same time fostering an adaptive, learning workforce that is more innovative than the terrorists who build and employ IEDs. Both of these capabilities enable leaders to meet the following objectives:<br /><br />&bull; Advise JIEDDO on implementation and sustainment of: the Managers' Internal Controls (MIC) program to ensure compliance with DoD Directive 5010.38; best business practices to achieve mission objectives; ensure programs and resources are protected from fraud, waste, and abuse; and enable leadership to make informed business or management decisions.<br /><br />&bull; Advise JIEDDO on executing a CPI program that provides a trusted capability founded on leading CPI practices that enables JIEDDO to effectively and efficiently achieve its strategic goals. The CPI office works across the organization to improve critical business processes by utilizing Lean Six Sigma and other process improvement techniques for phased projects and quick response assistance to continuously update and improve risk management and business execution processes within the organization.</p>
<p>Task #1</p>
<p>JIEDDO requires support services to assist JIEDDO in implementing and sustaining their MIC program through identifying and remediating internal control weaknesses and improving inefficient business processes. Key support efforts will include:<br /><br />&bull; Assistance to JIEDDO MCAs as they document key business processes and develop testing plans to validate the design and operating effectiveness of key controls within these processes.<br /><br />&bull; Codify and record JIEDDO efforts to comply with management control requirements that will significantly enable and enhance mission accomplishment.</p>
<p>&bull; Execute Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) on the tests conducted by the MCAs as requested.</p>
<p>&bull; Support remediation plan development, and assisting JIEDDO in implementing these plans, when needed. Remediation efforts may include using continuous process improvement techniques to help JIEDDO eliminate waste and abuse through implementing repeatable and efficient processes.<br /><br />&bull; Support and maintenance of internal performance metrics as regards the MIC program to provide JIEDDO leadership with timely, accurate, and actionable information to enable informed decisions to improve mission and management performance. <br /><br />The following sub-tasks outlined below are required as prioritized by JIEDDO leadership:</p>
<p>Sub Tasks<br />1. Processes and Controls Documentation - Support identifying key financial and operational controls in each business process and documenting these controls in Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) or internal guidance, consistent with federal internal control standards.</p>
<p>2. Internal Controls Test Plan Development - Facilitate sessions with JIEDDO MCAs to develop comprehensive testing plans to evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of documented controls. Provide guidance to MCAs as they execute the test plans and evaluate the results of their testing.<br /><br />3. Independent Verification &amp; Validation of Internal Controls - as requested support executing Independent Verification and Validation (IV&amp;V) procedures on the internal controls testing conducted by the MCAs for confirmation that the testing procedures were conducted in accordance with federal internal controls testing standards. IV&amp;V procedures will include review of testing results and supporting documentation, performance of selected samples and observation of controls in day-to-day operations. Internal Control Verification Reports will summarize the IV&amp;V procedures performed on each process.<br /><br />4. Remediate Internal Control Weaknesses - support development of remediation plans to address internal control vulnerabilities identified during the testing process. The remediation plans will include key milestones for management to use to monitor MCAs' progress towards implementing internal control improvements.</p>
<p>5. Governance Structure for Performance Metrics Program - support JIEDDO leadership in implementing and maintenance of a management framework to govern their performance metrics program. This framework will define roles and responsibilities for JIEDDO leadership in the program, tools and templates for developing metrics and targets, analyzing root causes of issues, reporting results and recommendations, and tracking improvements and criteria for prioritizing the development and reporting of metrics.<br /><br />6. Performance Metrics Program for Internal Processes - assist in the identification of performance metrics that track the effectiveness and efficiency of JIEDDO processes. Metrics will be prioritized for development based on risk, data availability and required level of effort. Support the reporting of new and existing metrics to Leadership on a periodic basis.</p>
<p>Task #2</p>
<p>To ensure rapid and effective responses to C-IED requirements, JIEDDO plans to continue aggressive streamlining of the internal processes that drive actions and achieve goals and objectives. The primary goals are to increase JIEDDO's overall operational efficiency and effectiveness and begin the process of transforming JIEDDO into a "learning" organization. To accomplish these goals, JIEDDO requires an internal capability to continuously assess, measure, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of any business process or internal control. With adequate resources, the Office of Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) within the IR Office can provide this capability for JIEDDO.<br /><br />Key support efforts will include:</p>
<p>&bull; Assistance to JIEDDO CPI Staff and JIEDDO Leadership in selecting and supporting value-added process improvement projects.</p>

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The mission of the Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to ensure an end to the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic by supporting research that can lead to the development of therapies, vaccines and prevention strategies.</p>
<p>Since the mid -1980s, animal models have played an important role in the NIAID's efforts to achieve its mission. Nonhuman primate (NHP) models present the opportunity to test a variety of candidate AIDS vaccines, optimizing their ability to elicit immune responses and testing their ability to prevent infection or to control virus replication after virus challenge. The NIAID provides immunological and virological support for NHP studies conducted at NIAID's Simian Vaccine Evaluation Unit (SVEU) contract sites and by DIADS-supported vaccine researchers through three existing NHP Core Laboratories (NHP Core Labs), which are: the Humoral Immunology Core Lab, the Cellular Immunology Core Lab and the Viral Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) Core Lab. The NHP Core Functional Genomics Laboratory will thus become a fourth NHP Core Lab, with the objective of ensuring standardization and comparability of functional genomics services and assays conducted for these SVEU and DAIDS-supported preclinical NHP studies. The ultimate aim is to apply and refine high throughput functional genomic approaches in NHPs to more effectively evaluate vaccine-induced adaptive and innate immune responses and vaccine efficacy in challenge/protection studies and identify responses (e.g., transcriptomic "signatures") that predict vaccine efficacy.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives <br />The purpose of the proposed contract will be to support both ongoing and new high-priority preclinical NHP protocols within the SVEU contracts and selected meritorious DAIDS grant-supported NHP projects testing preclinical prophylactic AIDS vaccines. Specifically, this contract will provide support for a NHP Core Functional Genomics Laboratory for the conduct and improvement of services and assays designed to generate specific quantitative genomic expression profiles (e.g., RNA transcriptomic "signatures") and network diagrams (using established Pathway Analysis programs) from RNA samples obtained from NHPs enrolled in priority SVEU protocols and DAIDS-supported investigator-initiated NHP studies. It is anticipated that during the years of this contract, the assays performed by the NHP Core Functional Genomics Laboratory will change as new technologies are developed.</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />The Contractor shall compile and analyze the generated data using bioinformatics and biocomputing tools (e.g., unbiased hierarchical clustering methods, sophisticated network algorithms, etc.) with the intent of identifying gene signatures that could potentially define correlates of protection and predict vaccine efficacy.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall be responsible for the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Establishing and applying a state-of-the-art high throughput microarray/transcriptomic platform/assay system to generate specific gene expression profiles (transcriptomic "signatures") from NHPs enrolled in priority SVEU protocols and studies supported by investigator-initiated grants;</p>
<p>&bull; Adopting state-of-the-art high throughput microarray/transcriptomic platform/assay systems as improved or alternative technologies develop, including increasing sensitivity and reproducibility, improving standardization, achieving greater throughput and lowering costs;</p>
<p>&bull; Compliance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practices (GCLP) [http://apps.who.int/tdr/svc/publications/tdr-research-publications/gclp-web] and BSL2;</p>
<p>&bull; Optimization and validation of assays; and</p>
<p>&bull; Compiling and analyzing gene expression data using appropriate bioinformatics and biocomputing tools (e.g., unbiased hierarchical clustering methods, sophisticated network algorithms, etc.).</p>
<p>Though assay development will not be supported under this contract, the Contractor will be expected to have an understanding of and expertise in assay development.</p>
<p><br />Anticipated Period of Performance<br />It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, level-of-effort (term) type contract will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one (1) year (Base Period) plus four (4) one-year options (terms) that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally, for a total possible performance period of five (5) years, beginning on or about June 17, 2013. The requirement will be for the delivery of 3.85 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the Base Period (Year 1) and each option period (Years 2 through 5).</p>
<p>In addition, the Government may unilaterally exercise options for increased level-of-effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand for the conduct of RNA microarray/transcriptomic assays and analyses. It is estimated that 0.95 FTE/year will be needed for each option. The Government may unilaterally exercise an option up to two times in any year of the contract.</p>
<p>Capability Statement/Information Sought<br />Capability Statements should clearly convey information regarding the respondent's capabilities, including: (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information;</p>
<p>Interested contractors must submit a capability statement (five page limitation, excluding resumes) describing their company's experience and ability to perform this effort which includes the following: (1) a summary list of similar work previously performed; (2) the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement; (3) resumes for proposed key personnel, including the Principal Investigator/co-PI, which reflect education, and previous work relevant to the proposed requirement; (4) a general description of the facilities and other resources needed to perform the work; and (5) demonstrated ability to carry out the work.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to purchase 50 each of Dryer Assembly, Radiodetection Corporation P/N 48058, NSN: 4440-01-398-2207 and 50 each of Desiccant Tower Radiodetection Corporation P/N 35401, NSN: 4440-01-398-2209. These items are being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), NEXRAD program, to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). Both items are manufactured by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) SPX Corporation, d/b/a Radiodetection Corporation. These items are manufactured solely by the OEM for use in the NWS NEXRAD system. The OEM markets their own products and does not utilize a network of wholesale distributors. The unique characteristics and physical form of these items makes them the only acceptable parts. Because the design is the intellectual property of Radiodetection Corporation, the Government does not have access to the specific design features. The Government has no design rights to the items and does not possess the drawings that specify the parts. This was determined through communications with the OEM. The NWS performed a market research and found there are no substitute part numbers or manufacturers identified through the search. This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The anticipated award date shall be within 10 calendar days after the date of this publication. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, furnish detailed information concerning their capabilities to provide these products. Interested firms must submit support documents if providing or proposing to provide other than the specified dryer assembly (P/N 48058) or desiccant tower (P/N 35401) that meets the same fit, form and function as the specified part numbers. Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other Government agency to which it has previously provided the item. Offerors may send their proposal to email address karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or fax to 816-274-6952 ATTN: Karen Christian. The NAICS code for this requirement is 335999. All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the Agency. All contractors doing business with the Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD) must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) or certification of registration in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). This is a Government initiative that was designed by the Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) to replace the paper Representations and Certifications (Reps &amp; Certs) process. No award can be made unless the vendor is registered with CCR. For more information and to register with the CCR and ORCA, please access the following websites: http://www.ccr.gov/ and http://www.bpn.gov. In order to register with the CCR and ORCA offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at http://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.

DCMS processes home and business loans to rebuild property damaged by a declared disaster. It is a web enabled system operating in a Unix/Oracle platform. This system collects all manner of data from businesses and private citizens in order to perform due diligence in the underwriting process. <br /><br />Use Case Scenarios<br />The following are generalized scenarios to better understand the work conducted by ODA. The following should not be considered exhaustive.<br /><br />&bull; Field Activities Conducted During Disaster Response Activities<br />These activities occur in disaster areas with limited or non-existent infrastructure. This would include limited access to cellular or WiFi networks. <br /><br />&bull; Loss Verification<br />Loss verification is part of the underwriting process. It establishes the value of the damage being claimed. This is an onsite process that entails interviews, site assessment, documenting damage, sketches and the calculation of the total area of the property.<br /><br />&bull; Loan Application<br />The loan application process can be conducted electronically using a web-based tool or on paper. This application initiates the loan processing. <br /><br />&bull; Coordination<br />&bull; With SBA Management<br />Throughout an event, coordination between the field and office are occurring to align resources, provide performance metrics and support communications.<br /><br />&bull; With Other Federal Agencies<br />From response to recovery, the ODA works closely with federal, state and local agencies to support an effective delivery of services. <br /><br />&bull; Management<br />The goal is to provide timely and actionable information. Activities could include briefings and planning sessions. Management activities could occur at: <br />&bull; Typical Office Environments<br />&bull; Home Offices<br />&bull; Disaster sites<br />&bull; Processing Centers: For the ODA, there are dedicated sites to process loan applications, provide customer service, and maintain field activities. During disaster events, they can scale to accommodate events of greater magnitude.<br /><br />&bull; Training<br />Training is provided to core staff as well as surge staff. Thus, the training activities include refresher courses and multi-week training events for new, temporary employees. <br /><br />Requested Information<br /><br />&bull; Identify optimal technology frameworks to support SBA services at a disaster site. Such discussions could include key decision points to identify selected technologies. More specific requirements include the following:<br /><br />o Management tools and devices that allow device control, software management and version control;<br />o Support the device imaging to effectively deploy up to 1000 devices;<br />o Support over the air device management;<br />o Provide systems capable of complying with FIPS 199 HIGH impact security controls;<br />o Operate in wet and dirty environments (Note: milspec standards are not necessarily a requirement and, in many cases, are more rigorous that required).<br /><br />&bull; Identify application development framework to maximize opportunities to leverage mobile device capabilities across multiple operating systems. Such discussions could include key decision points to identify selected technologies. More specific requirements include the following:<br /><br />o Allow offline usage with the ability to synchronize<br />o Maximize portability across multiple platforms<br />o Support a variety of functionalities including GPS and camera<br />o Support encryption for data at rest and in transit<br />o Architectural considerations to integrate with backend systems<br />o Integrate with third party apps and APIs<br /><br />&bull; Identify technologies, tools, and approaches that could include the following:<br />o Present, analyze and enter data to support an effective and efficient business process. <br />o Provide access to enterprise resources<br />o Extend voice and video to disaster centers<br />o Collect digital signatures</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)<br />CPP (Controllable Pitch Propeller) Sytems<br />&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; The United States Coast Guard Yard is requesting information for technical assistant for WLB 225 CPP and thruster work. The Coast Guard Yard is seeking sources which can provide the following support:
<p>Technical publication and associated drawings for Rolls Royce Naval Marine controllable pitch propeller and thruster systems aboard 225' WLBs do not include all necessary information to inspect these systems. Though mechanical damage is generally apparent during inspection, RRNM does not publish limits for typical mechanical measurements such as thrust, running clearance, run out, backlash, etc. As such, technical assistance is needed to give the customer the OEM's opinion and recommendation for these types of readings.</p>
<p>As written in the specification (typical) the tech is required to be on site for all work involving these systems to: "Provide manufacturer's proprietary information, software, and tools pertinent to the equipment/system", and to "Assist with proper repair methods, and ensure compliance with manufacturer's procedures an standards during disassembly, inspection, repair, modification, calibration, and reassembly of the equipment/system".</p>
<p>Since these systems are not originally manufactured by RRNM, but by Bird-Johnson, responsible field level engineers with technical knowledge of the required and acceptable parameters for the WLB CPP and thruster systems would likely suffice as "Technical Representative" (should be able to document performance with this system during employment with Bird-Johnson). They would also need to possess the technical drawings/designs of these systems that are not available to the end user (US Coast Guard). Software and tools, as referenced above, are not applicable to this system, as the controls side of it are governed by an MPCMS scheme designed/assembled by TANO, and the only special tools required for service are already possessed by the government.</p>
<p>Field service representatives with the requisite knowledge and documents to work on this system would likely have to provide the same workmanship guarantee that RRNM offers as these systems are CRITICAL to the operability of this class of ship. Any system casualty of CPP or thrusters makes the cutter ineffective at its primary mission.</p>
<p>1) Field service level technical assistance is required for inspection, maintenance, and repair of Bird-Johnson model 125/3 stay/FP thruster and model 102 controllable pitch propeller systems used aboard USCG 225WLB ships. <br />2) Technician must be able to provide information not available to the end user (US Coast Guard) about the design parameters for these systems, including but not limited to, acceptable ranges of back lash, clearance, thrust, wear, run out, and performance characteristics. This information is not available in technical publication provided to the government for these systems when the ships were built.<br />3) Technician must be able to advise on proper disassembly, inspection, reassembly, and repair methods for the model 125/3 stay/FP thruster and model 102 controllable pitch propeller system.<br />4) Technician must provide documented proof of experience in satisfactorily performing service on the model 125/3 stay/FP thruster and model 102 controllable pitch propeller systems. This information should be submitted to perform service for the US Coast Guard Yard.<br /><br />The U.S. Coast Guard Yard does not possess the manufacturer's technical information. engineering drawings, test procedures, or test equipment. Interested parties having the expertise and capabilities to meet any or all of the above requirements are invited to submit detailed information discussing their capabilities.<br /><br />Potential sources with the expertise and required capabilities tio provide these services can submit such data discussing the same in duplicate within 7 business&nbsp;days (COB on 05/07/2012 at 4pm EST) from the date of this announcement. This data must include sufficient information to allow the Coast Guard to evaluate the proposal relative to the above requirements. No cost or pricing data is required.

<DESC><strong>Request for Information (RFI): Emic<br />Posted Date: April 26, 2012<br />Response Date: June 11, 2012</strong>
<p><strong><br />Synopsis<br /></strong>This request for information (RFI) is intended to provide information relevant to a possible future IARPA investment (such as a program or grand challenge). Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement to include suggestions for improving the scope of a possible solicitation to ensure that every effort is made to adequately address the scientific and technical challenges described below. Responses to this request may be used to support development of, and subsequently be incorporated within, a future IARPA solicitation and therefore must be available for unrestricted public distribution. Neither proprietary nor classified concepts or information should be included in the responses. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses. <br /><br /><strong>Background and Scope<br /></strong>Can one person know what it is like to be someone else, particularly someone from a different culture? And if they could adopt that person's perspective, would that increase their ability to understand and anticipate the other person's behaviors?</p>
<p>In a world that has been characterized as instantly accessible but poorly understood, the need to effectively and accurately make sense of other people's perspectives and worldviews is growing in importance. Whether in business, diplomacy, or intelligence, an accurate understanding of how the world is perceived by someone else, and how that view may shape their beliefs and behaviors, can mean the difference between successful interactions and unfortunate misunderstandings.</p>
<p>The importance of understanding others is evident in the large numbers of training and research programs focusing on "cultural awareness." Currently, many of the existing efforts to teach and train cultural knowledge and skills share what anthropologists have called an "etic" approach (REFS: 1,2,3,4,5): that is, they adopt an outsiders' view of that culture, and attempt to increase one's knowledge of others through the use of terms that can be theoretically applied across cultures in a way that some consider to be "culturally-neutral" or more "objective." Ultimately, etic analysis reflects the perspective of a cultural "outsider" and, even as it seeks to elucidate someone else's worldview, it does so in the observer's own terms and from the observer's own perspective (6), often translating native language and concepts into ones that the outsider shares with their own group, but that would be unfamiliar to the "natives" in question.</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) seeks instead to explore new approaches or ideas that could complement these etic analyses by developing first-person cultural simulations whereby one can experience a situation or interaction <strong>as if</strong> they were someone from a different culture - or what the anthropologist Clifford Geertz called "from the native's point of view" (7). This approach towards trying to understand a culture from the "inside-out" has often been associated with what cultural anthropologists call "emic"(8) analysis. As compared to etic approaches, emic analysis looks at behaviors or beliefs in terms meaningful to the cultural native and attempts to convey their perspective as a cultural insider in a way that is situation-dependent, derived from a rich, multi-sensory experience of the world, and is largely derived from implicit associations.</p>
<p><strong>Comparisons of etic vs emic approaches to understanding others:<br /><br />Etic</strong> <br />&bull; Defining, experiencing, or interpreting other beliefs and behaviors using one's own cultural frame, definitions, and perspective<br />&bull; Cultural beliefs and behaviors are described as if from an objective, "third-person" viewpoint (e.g. this is what someone else is like)<br />&bull; Tends to rely on explicit frameworks to model/simulate beliefs/behaviors using rules and logical relationships<br />&bull; Outcome is often measured in explicit ways: "one should do this; one shouldn't do that"<br />&bull; Data may be used for building models to help you (consciously) understand others' behavior<br /><strong><br />Emic<br /></strong>&bull; Defining, experiencing, or interpreting other beliefs and behaviors using the other individual's cultural frame, definitions, and perspective<br />&bull; Beliefs and behaviors are experienced from a subjective, first-person viewpoint (e.g. this is what it is "like" to be someone else)<br />&bull; Tends to leverage context-dependent, implicit associations for "understanding" others' beliefs and behaviors using subjective experience<br />&bull; Outcome may be more intuitive: "this feels right to me; this doesn't feel right to me"<br />&bull; Data may be used for building models of how your own behavior may be (implicitly) understood by others</p>
<p>Whereas Geertz was pessimistic in 1974 about the possibility of ever truly perceiving what someone else perceives (saying that all that could be done was to "scratch surfaces...")(9), in the 35+ years since his address to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, we have seen the advent of new technologies and new research that may help us move past scratching surfaces in trying to perceive the world from the "native's point of view." Examples include improvements in computing, massive data collection and aggregation, novel methods for data visualization, new graphic user interfaces, rich multi-sensory and immersive environments, as well as significant advances in the behavioral sciences, cultural psychology, neuroscience and psychophysiology. These advances may offer us new opportunities for developing tools that allow a non-expert to virtually (and temporarily) "embody" the perspective of another person from a different culture. This capability may allow them to more accurately grasp a native's point of view on a particular situation, interaction, or decision - and potentially lead to a reduction in interpersonal and/or intercultural misunderstanding and miscalculation.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI therefore should focus on theories, techniques, tools, and metrics that would aid in building and objectively measuring capabilities that enable someone to "suspend" their own cultural perspective of a particular situation or event and instead have a rapid, accurate, and effective first-person "emic" experience of that situation or event as an individual from a different culture.</p>
<p><strong>Key Questions<br /></strong>To explore the feasibility of developing a simulation or tool that enables someone to have a rapid, accurate, and effective first-person experience of what it is like to be someone else from another culture or background, this RFI invites interested parties to respond with novel ideas, approaches, and/or examples of data that can answer one, some, or all of the following questions: <br /><strong><br />1. Feasibility<br /></strong>To what extent can someone authentically experience another person's perspective? What is the feasibility of developing a tool to help a non-expert, without "native" language skills or years in the field, rapidly gain a first-person implicit perspective from someone else's point of view in order to increase that non-expert's cultural understanding? What theories and evidence support your assessment?</p>
<p><strong>2. Relevant science<br /></strong>Are there new advances and findings from psychological, behavioral, engineering, social, and/or cognitive sciences (or other fields), which ought to be incorporated in an emic-based tool or simulation? If so, what are they? As an example, to what extent could (and should) an emic approach leverage insights from specific research on embodied cognition, mirror neurons, perspective-taking exercises, implicit association tests, the somatic marker hypothesis, etc.? Are there new advances in linguistics that may contribute to the feasibility and effectiveness of an emic-based tool or simulation?</p>
<p><strong>3. Relevant data and assessment tools<br /></strong>Are there tools or techniques that can be used to assess the extent to which someone has had an "authentic" 1st person "emic" perspective? Are there specific behavioral, neural, psychological, and/or physiological data that have theoretical and empirical support for assessing such authenticity? Have there been advances in tools that might facilitate the measurement of the effectiveness of an emic-based tool or simulation for people of different ability and experience levels?</p>
<p><strong>4. Real world metrics<br /></strong>How might someone measure and validate the real-world effectiveness of any such emic-based tool or simulation for increasing cultural understanding above and beyond current etic approaches? What tasks, tests, or scenarios might be used as performance measures to quantify emic's effectiveness? How would we know if someone really experienced someone else's perspective, and whether or not that mattered?</p>
<p>Interested parties should identify which of the above questions they are addressing in their submission. Submissions may address one, some, or all of the questions. The responses to this RFI may be used to help in the planning of an agenda and participant list for a 1.5-day workshop on emic-based tools and approaches for enhancing perspective-taking. An expected result from the workshop may be the identification of promising areas for investment through vehicles like seedlings, grand challenges, and programs. It is anticipated that this workshop will be held in late June, 2012. A separate workshop announcement may be posted with further details. <br /><br /><strong>Out of Scope<br /></strong>As the focus of this RFI is on innovative ideas and tools that specifically speak to the emic approach, and in order to distinguish emic from more conventional etic approaches, the following topics are considered out-of-scope and are discouraged from being submitted:</p>
<p>&bull; Approaches or tools that require a subject matter expert to "validate" the authenticity of the first-person experience;<br />&bull; Approaches or tools that involve someone maintaining their own native perspective while attempting to understand another's, including:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o First-person simulations or teaching tools that allow an individual to remain subjectively themselves, and do not require them to take another person's perspective to achieve the teaching objectives (e.g. most first-person video games or immersive environments in which the subject remains consciously themselves while "pretending" to be someone else in a superficial manner, rather than the subject experiencing another person's perspective by being immersed in someone else's experience);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Simulations that simply "switch" the character one is playing within a game or simulation (e.g. controlling a "native" character, while the person is still making decisions based on their own calculus and perspective)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The use of tools or techniques that teach someone how to interact with, or understand, someone from a different culture, rather than what it is like to be someone from that culture;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Translation of another's cultural terms, worldview, or patterns of behavior into one's own terms, worldview, or behaviors (e.g. approaches that do not represent and require adopting someone else's mental model of the environment); or,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Use of large datasets or models to create computational simulations or predictions of others' behavior from a "third-person" or "etic" perspective (e.g. the Human Social Culture Behavior Modeling Program)(10).<br /><br /><strong>Preparation Instructions to Respondents<br /></strong>IARPA solicits respondents to submit ideas related to this topic for use by the Government in formulating a potential program. IARPA requests that submittals briefly and clearly describe the potential approach or concept, outline critical technical issues, and comment on the expected performance, robustness, and estimated cost of the proposed approach.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, Wallops CDA Station, Wallops Island, Virginia, intends to negotiate and award a firm fixed price contract to Microcom Design Inc., 10948 Beaver Dam Road, Cockeysville, Maryland 21030-2237. Microcom Design Inc. is the only source available to satisfy the agency requirements for on-site training of agency operations personnel for the GOES Data Collection System (DCS). The DCS is supported by two components. The first is to ingest hardware/software that receives the signal transmitted from the GOES spacecraft. This portion which includes demodulators and associated processing hardware/software is called Data Acquisition and Monitoring Systems-New Technology (DAMS-NT). The second is the processing hardware/software that generates and distributes national critical measureable weather data for customers throughout the western hemisphere. This part of the system is the DCS Administrative Data Distribution System (DADDS). In order to meet maintenance responsibilities in a 24/7 environment, adequate training must be provided to technicians that perform the work. This requires unique experience and knowledge of GOES Data Collection System (DCS) equipment. Microcom Design Inc. is the only responsible source who can provide the required skills and expertise to successfully provide the training.</p>
<p>The Federal Supply Code for this requirement is U012 and the North American Identification Classification System (NAICS) code is 611420. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source&nbsp;under the authority of FAR 6.302(c)(1). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the training that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposal requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses to this notice, if any, must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. Inquires will only be accepted via email to donna.l.cohee@noaa.gov</p>
<p>Per FAR 13, this is a simplified acquisition with an estimated value of less than $150,000.00. In order to comply with the debt collection improvement act of 1966, all contractors must be registered in the central contractor registration (CCR) to be considered for an award of a federal contract.

<CONTACT>Benjamin Sherrill, Contracting Officer, Phone 7038754983, Email sherrillbd2@state.gov
<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) <br />BAA-2012-DOS/AVC-VTRDN<br />Key Verification Assets Fund Program</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">FULL TEXT ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT TITLE: Key Verification Assets Fund Program</p>
<p>ANNOUNCEMENT TYPE: Initial Broad Agency Announcement. Any updates or possible cancellation will be issued as an amendment to the BAA. This annual review and subsequent amendments to the BAA shall meet the requirement of FAR 35.016 to update the BAA notice no less frequently than annually.</p>
<p>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT NUMBER: BAA-2012-DOS/AVC-VTRDN</p>
<p>This BAA is open to all interested parties, including Federally Funded Research Development Centers (FFRDC), Government, National, and academic (college and university) laboratories. Anticipated funding under this BAA (not per contract) is $1.8 million per Fiscal Year (FY). Individual awards will normally not exceed 12 months with dollar amounts typically less than $150,000.</p>
<p>This funding profile is an estimate only and will not be a contractual obligation for funding.</p>
<p>SECURITY: All submissions shall remain at the UNCLASSIFED level.<br /><br />BRIEF PROGRAM SUMMARY: The Department of State, Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance (AVC) through the Key Verification Assets Fund (V Fund) Program seeks ambitious, innovative research proposals to address requirements outlined in the UNCLASSIFED Verification Technology Research and Development Needs (VTRDN) Document. AVC invites researchers and project managers to submit white papers for sustaining, researching, developing, or acquiring technologies or programs relating to the verification of chemical, biological, nuclear and missiles arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament agreements or commitments. <br /><br />The V Fund program continues the Department of State's objective to find innovative approaches to current and future arms control, and nonproliferation policy implementation challenges through exchanges between the science and technology, policy and intelligence communities. The program supports and preserves critical verification assets and promotes the development of new technologies, improves and expands analytical tools, models, data and metrics applicable in the science and policy decision-making process. <br /><br />The intent of the V Fund is to be "seed money" for the Department to encourage other agencies either to develop new technologies or to adapt existing projects to the needs of arms control verification, and therefore its resources are, by design, modest relative to the scope of its mission. <br /><br />The fund requests annual project white papers ranging from the basic science level to assistance for the operation of a fully developed capability. The V Fund program welcomes white papers from individuals or multi-investigator research projects, experimental and on-going research by government organizations, national laboratories, academia, and industry. White papers must consider issues affecting arms control and nonproliferation.</p>
<p>WHITE PAPER/QUAD CHART: THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. The purpose of the white paper and quad chart (referred as white paper throughout) is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper does not include a cost proposal. White papers must sufficiently detail the concept's technical merit and its potential contributions to the AVC's mission. <br />White papers will be accepted at anytime. Technical reviews/selection points may be conducted based on the needs of AVC at anytime. However, white papers are estimated to be evaluated semi-annually on June 15 and Feb 15. Selectee will be requested to provide full proposals after completion of the peer/technical review and a determination of funds availability.<br /><br />This BAA will remain open for White Paper submission through 1200 hours EST on the closing date, April 25, 2013. White papers received after the due date shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). Proposals received after the closing date will not be reviewed or evaluated.<br /><br />FORMAT AND SUBMITTAL: White papers that do not meet format requirements may be rejected without further review or evaluation. Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov in order to be eligible for contract award. <br /><br />All pages shall be printed on 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper with type not smaller than 12 point. Smaller font may be used for figures, tables and charts. The total white paper shall not exceed 3 single spaced pages, excluding quad charts, tables, figures etc. <br /><br />Offerors must identify information considered proprietary by marking their submissions with the restrictive language contained in FAR 52.215-1(e), Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition.</p>
<p>In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address. Individual white paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other information submitted under this BAA.<br />White paper shall be submitted by e-mail only to VCI-BAA@state.gov and contain the following information.<br /><br />&bull; Proposal Title: Name of the project.</p>
<p>&bull; Proposal Summary: Use the attached quad chart format. This is separate from the project description below.</p>
<p>&bull; Project Description: 3 single space pages is the maximum length of the project description.</p>
<p>&bull; Project Duration: 12 months or less.</p>
<p>&bull; Project Budget: &lt; $500.00 - $150K: Proposals must provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) breakdown. The ROM should be consistent with any dollar value or ranges specified in the announcement, as well as the level of work being proposed. White papers should avoid proprietary or data not critical to the idea being presented. The V fund program provides modest funds to for science and technology projects that have applicability towards arms control verification and transparency technologies.</p>
<p>&bull; Principal Investigator(s): List all principal investigators and organizations and the role of each investigator in the project.</p>
<p>&bull; Partner, Collaborator and End User: List all partners and collaborators along with their respective organizations and potential end users. It should be clear which individual(s) are conducting what phase or portions of the research AND/OR are funding aspects of the proposal. Any information relating to the transition to an end user(s) should be identified.</p>
<p>&bull; Timeline for selection: White papers will be evaluated semi-annually on June 15 and Feb 15. Selectees will be requested to provide full proposals after completion of the peer/technical review and a determination of funds availability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;QUAD CHART FORMAT: ***See format in BAA attachment***</p>
<p>EVALUATION CRITERIA: The white paper will be evaluated utilizing a peer or scientific review process and shall be evaluated based on the following criteria that are listed in "DESCENDING" order of importance: <br /><br />&bull; Overall scientific and technical merits; <br />&bull; Importance/potential to the AVC's mission areas; <br />&bull; Fund availability/affordability</p>
<p>White papers will be evaluated based on the evaluation criteria, for the likelihood of providing solutions for requirements in the annual UNCLASSIFED Verification Technology Research and Development Needs (VTRDN) Document. The VTRDN highlights an investment strategy, needed to assist the Department of State and other policymakers in evaluating compliance activities, developing transparency initiatives, or enabling verification of treaties and agreements.</p>
<p>OTHER THAN WHITE PAPERS, NO PROPOSALS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED. A letter requesting a proposal (RFP) will be issued by the Contracting Officer (CO) as determined by a peer or scientific review of a white paper. Due dates and times will be specified in each letter requesting a proposal issued by the CO. <br />White papers found to be consistent with the requirements of the BAA may be invited to submit a formal technical and cost proposal. An invitation to submit a proposal does not assure that the offeror will be awarded a subsequent contract. If requested to submit a formal proposal the offeror will be requested to do so in accordance with the RFP. There will be no other announcement issued for this requirement.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT

The West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Network Contracting Office 8, Department of Veterans Affairs) intends to enter into a sole source contract for the procurement of preventative and corrective maintenance and repair services for five 208V EVOTECH Endoscope Cleaner and Reprocessors (ECRs). 

These services will be procured from Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP), a Division of Ethicon, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company, located at 33 Technology Drive, Irvine, CA, 92618-2346. The applicable NAICS code for this procurement is 81129 (Other Electronic and Precision Equipment Repair and Maintenance), with a size standard of $19 million.

The Government intends to issue an out-of-scope modification to contract VA248-P-1587, which provides preventative and corrective maintenance and repair services for five ASP STERRAD sterilizers at the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center. This modification will execute this requirement on a Sole Source Basis, per FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), wherein "the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source." 

Servicing the systems requires the ability to provide replacement parts.  ASP will not sell parts for the EVOTECH systems to a third party and the VA does not possess personnel (i.e., prior EVOTECH  technicians) with the technical capabilities necessary to maintain and repair the EVOTECH sterilizers. Because of this, besides ASP, there are no known providers of EVOTECH system maintenance service.  

All responsible sources which assert that they can provide these services may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. Interested respondents must submit a capability statement by April 30, 2012. Submission of a capability statement shall be made via email, to Eric Sullivan, Contracting Officer, at eric.sullivan2@va.gov. Subject of email should reference VA248-P-1587 

All responses received will be evaluated. A determination by the Government not to compete the requirement, based upon the responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Costs associated with the preparation and submission of information and any follow-up information requests are the responsibility of the offeror, and these costs will not be reimbursed by the Government.

<p>b. If the contractor delivers a package from one location to another location and then has to return the package to the original pickup location per the request of the Wright-Patterson laboratory personnel, a round trip charge shall be charge as follows: Dayton area round trips shall be charge at agreed rates both ways and out-of-town round trips shall be charged at full rate one way and at 50 percent for the return trip.

<p>B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. No Offeror shall alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered an unacceptable offer and may result in the offer being considered non responsive. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. In addition, to identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced, enter "NSP" in the unit price and/or to identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge, enter "NC" in the unit price.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>Subfactor 4 - Diversity. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound pictorial approach for diversity to include the methodology for accomplishing diversity.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services.This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street., SW, JR11-0203 <br />Washington, DC 20593-0001 <br />Telephone 202.372.3692<br />Fax: 202.475-3904</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations.  It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, DCHA/OFDA maintains six permanent regional offices in San Jose, Costa Rica; Bangkok, Thailand; Dakar, Senegal; Nairobi, Kenya; Pretoria, South Africa and Budapest, Hungary; and three sub-regional offices in Almaty, Kazakhstan; Cairo Egypt and Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs).  PRAs serve as the regional team leaders in disaster response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities.  They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional office, as applicable, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Regional Coordinators and the OFDA Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington, the multi-year strategies for their respective regions.</p>
<p>The West and North Africa Regional Office (WNARO) in Dakar, Senegal, covers 24 countries in West and North Africa.  The region is largely comprised of poor, food insecure nations, and politically unstable and failing states with diverse cultures, languages, topographies, and disaster vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires a PRA for its regional office in Dakar, Senegal to serve as the regional team leader in disaster response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction (DRR) activities.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Principal Regional Advisor's responsibilities will include the following:</p>
<p>1) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the Disaster Response Team Leader in OFDA/Washington (OFDA/W), the PRA will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as the OFDA lead representative and the primary point of contact on OFDA -related matters in the assigned region;<br />&bull;	Manage the regional office in Dakar, supervise all office staff, and ensure all staff receive appropriate OFDA training;<br />&bull;	Travel to disaster locations and/or areas of potential disasters and conduct initial assessments of damages and needs; coordinate representational support to DART team leaders, as required;<br />&bull;	Recommend appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions in consultation with USAID/Washington; provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of all disaster, humanitarian, and emergency events;<br />&bull;	Coordinate and maintain close liaison with representatives of host governments, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. embassies and USAID missions to ensure efficient and coordinated disaster response activities;<br />&bull;	Monitor OFDA-funded activities, to ensure objectives are being met and beneficiaries are being served; <br />&bull;	Coordinate the requests, receipt, distribution, tracking, and accounting of relief supplies provided by OFDA;<br />&bull;	Facilitate and coordinate the arrival and departure of DARTs and assessment teams with the U.S. Mission, and serve on DARTs or assessment teams when required; may serve as the Team Leader, as necessary;<br />&bull;	Maintain communications, while on travel, with their respective regional/sub-regional offices and OFDA/W, as necessary; <br />&bull;	Under the guidance and supervision of the Disaster Response Team Leader, coordinate with OFDA/W and with other OFDA regional offices, and prepare information requirements and reports.</p>
<p>2) Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation - Working closely with OFDA/W and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the PRA will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.</p>
<p>Specifically, the PRA, in collaboration with colleagues in OFDA/W regional teams, and under the guidance and supervision of the Disaster Response Team Leader in OFDA/W, will:</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare or supervise the preparation of regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries;<br />&bull;	Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance for OFDA, USAID, local governments, and other donors/organizations, as appropriate;<br />&bull;	Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID officials on disaster response, mitigation and risk reduction efforts, including the review of sector disaster response and DRM and DRR plans;<br />&bull;	Provide support, as required, for other DRM and DRR initiatives in the assigned region.  Support may include assessment visits, project design/evaluation exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;<br />&bull;	In the area of mitigation, work with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries, and develop projects/activities for addressing these;<br />&bull;	Work with local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate mitigation into appropriate programs.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The PRA will take direction from and will report to the Disaster Response Team Leader in OFDA/W.</p>
<p><br />SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), international organizations (IOs) including the United Nations (UN) agencies, and to other partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human-caused disaster situations. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

There should be a total of four shelves in each of the 36" deep systems including the base shelf, and a total of six shelves in the 24" deep systems including the base shelf. The shelving shall include complete back and side panels on each system, a digital keypad access system, and motorized movement. The current shelves are grey, and the new shelving should match those. A ceiling and a floor are not necessary and neither are doors.</p>
<p>The digital keypad shall be programmed so each user enters their personal code and the unit will automatically open the fixture that way it can be tracked who the last person to access the equipment stored in each fixture was. It will not interface with any existing security systems. There shall be one key pad per shelving unit and they shall be programmed so each authorized person will have one code assigned per person that will grant them access to all units but no more than one unit can be open at a time. There shall be codes for up to 200 people as well as a safety mechanism so a person cannot be crushed between the units when closing (not a counter).<br />The fixtures not being replaced will be altered to match the new units being installed. This means a steel back, two linoleum sides, and a key pad will be installed on each unit. The wood on the existing shelves will be replaced with ventilated or corrugated shelves (either one). They will need to be on the same track as the other units with motorized movement as well. At this time they are stationary. The first unit will remain stationary but must still be on the track to match height, all others must be mobile. The last two shelving units will face each other so the entire system can be locked up when not in use. To do so, all mobile units shall be closed up towards the stationary unit.<br />All new shelving units' parts must be compatible with the parts of the existing unit manufactured by Lyon.<br /><br />When open, the aisle width shall be 61.5".<br />The shelf arrangement will be as follows:<br />36" Units - base shelf, plus three more shelves approximately 36" apart<br />24" Units - base shelf, plus five more shelves approximately 25" apart<br />The structure shall be designed to support 1,000lbs per shelf, including the top of the unit. It is a possibility that material may be stored up there as well.<br />Tracks will be built into a concrete base so carts may be rolled over the tracks without difficulty</p>
<p>CORRRECTION: The requested mobile storage unit will replace the existing fixed storage unit up to the last two fixtures. These two fixtures are shown in the posted pictures outside of the yellow marked area. These two fixtures will be modified to have backing, as well as the digital keypad that will be on the new fixtures. All fixtures, new and old, will be motorized on an above ground track which will be installed on the existing concrete floor. To secure the unit tracking, small anchors may be installed into the concrete floor. Anchors shall be no larger than &frac14; in. x 2 in.</p>
<p>The old fixtures being replaced are shown within the yellow marked area in the pictures posted. Our own personnel will be removing these fixtures. Therefore, removal shall not be included in this buy.</p>

<p>All existing&nbsp;fixtures will be removed prior to the start of this project. There should be a total of four shelves in&nbsp;all&nbsp;ten&nbsp;of the 36" deep fixtures including the base shelf, and a total of six shelves in&nbsp;all four of the&nbsp;24" deep&nbsp;fixtures including the base shelf. The shelving shall include complete back and side panels on each fixture, a digital keypad access system, and motorized movement. A ceiling and a floor are not necessary and neither are doors.</p>
<p>The digital keypad shall be programmed so each user enters their personal code and the unit will automatically open the fixture that way it can be tracked who the last person to access the equipment stored in each fixture was. It will not interface with any existing security systems. There shall be one key pad per shelving&nbsp;fixture and they shall be programmed so each authorized person will have one code assigned per person that will grant them access to all units but no more than one unit can be open at a time. There shall be codes for up to 200 people as well as a safety mechanism so a person cannot be crushed between the units when closing (not a counter).<br /><br />The first&nbsp;fixture will remain stationary but must still be on the track to match height, all others must be mobile. The last two shelving&nbsp;fixture will face each other so the entire system can be locked up when not in use. To do so, all mobile&nbsp;fixtures shall be closed up towards the stationary fixture.<br /><br />When open, the aisle width shall be 61.5".<br />The shelf arrangement will be as follows:<br />36"&nbsp;Fixtures - base shelf, plus three more shelves approximately 36" apart<br />24" Fixtures - base shelf, plus five more shelves approximately 25" apart<br />The structure shall be designed to support 1,000lbs per shelf, including the top of the fixtures. It is a possibility that material may be stored up there as well.<br />Tracks will be built into a concrete base (no plywood)&nbsp;so carts may be rolled over the tracks without difficulty.</p>
<p>CORRRECTION: The requested mobile storage&nbsp;system will entirely replace the existing&nbsp;stationary storage fixtures. All fixtures except for the first fixture, will be motorized on an above ground track which will be installed on the existing concrete floor. The first fixture will be on the same track but it will not be motorized.&nbsp;To secure the&nbsp;system tracking, small anchors may be installed into the concrete floor. Anchors shall be no larger than &frac14; in. x 2 in.</p>
<p>The &nbsp;fixtures being replaced are shown in the pictures posted. Our own personnel will be removing these fixtures. Therefore, removal shall not be included in this buy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

All work will be done during the working hours of 0700 to 1700 (7 am to 5 pm). We will provide all electrical work necessary. There are no prevaling wages for this buy.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street., SW, JR11-0203 <br />Washington, DC 20593-0001 <br />Telephone 202.372.3692<br />Fax: 202.475-3904</p>

<DESC><p><strong>Description:<br /></strong>The 92d Contracting Squadron will be soliciting for a competitive 8(a), Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) to provide indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity and design-build (up to 35%) construction efforts to support the 92d CES mission at Fairchild AFB, Washington. <br />Individual task order work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction. Task order limits will be $2,500 to $650,000. The contractor shall provide all material, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner. The maximum program value (combined value of all task orders from all awarded contracts) is not to exceed $7M over a two-year period. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and one 12-month option period.<br />Work to be performed under the MATOC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 Construction, Subsection 236 Construction of Buildings size standard $33.5M and Subsection 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, size standard $33.5M. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects. The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos abatement/removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete masonry, welding, and paving. Locations of work will be at Fairchild AFB, WA and other associated sites outside the base proper. All off base sites are within 80 miles of Fairchild AFB. Offers are solicited only from small business concerns who are expressly certified for participation in the 8(a) program; and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236220 must specifically be included in the Offerors approved business plan. <br />It has been determined that competition will be limited to 8(a) firms located within the geographical area serviced by the SBA Seattle District Office, and other 8(a) construction firms with a bona fide place of business within the geographical competitive area, and the assigned NAICS code. All other 8(a) BD Participants are deemed ineligible to submit offers. <br /><br /><strong>Evaluation:<br /></strong>Each offeror's proposal will be evaluated utilizing best value source selection procedures. The basis for award is to be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) without technical factors. The procedures described in FAR Part 15.3, AFFAR 5315.3, Policy Memorandums 11-C-04 and 11-C-07 and source selection procedures will be utilized. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a seed project. The magnitude of the seed project is less than $25,000. The offeror's Past Performance will be considered approximately equal in importance to the Seed Project's Price.

Also, all offeror's shall show the capability of receiving $3M in bonding annually. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer deems discussions are in the Government's best interest. The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. In that event, the Source Selection Authority (SSA) shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision, considering price and past performance tradeoff, for award of the seed project. Additional MATOC contract awards will be determined based on the final rankings of the highest rated proposals from the SSA's integrated assessment best value award decision.<br /><br /><strong>Award:</strong> The Government anticipates awarding up to three (3) Firm-Fixed Price, Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. In addition, up to three (3) Fixed Price Task Orders to attend an orientation seminar will be awarded to meet the minimum contract guarantee resulting from this solicitation, not to exceed $2,500 and in accordance with the Joint Travel Regulation. Contractor's participation in this seminar, held at Fairchild AFB, is mandatory. Future individual task order requirements will be competed among the awardees in accordance with the solicitation and contract provisions. In the event this RFP results in only one award, the awardee shall proceed to construct the project described in this RFP as the seed project as required by the terms of the resulting contract. <br /><br />The Government reserves the right to cancel this RFP either before or after the closing date.<br /><br />The RFP will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about 10 May 2012 and close on or about 10 June 2012. This is an all-electronic solicitation release. Hard copies are not available. The Government will post amendments to the solicitation to the Electronic Posting System (EPS) at http://fbo.gov/.

<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

The Contractor shall collect scientific, management, regulatory compliance and economic data for fisheries by placing at-sea monitors aboard U. S. domestic fishing vessels participating in the groundfish multispecies Fisheries Management Plan. This information is required in response to the implementation of Amendment 16 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (NEFMP). The at-sea monitors collect scientific, management, compliance, and other data at sea through interviews of vessel captains and crew, observations of fishing operations, photographing catch, and measurements of selected portions of the catch and fishing gear. The primary responsibilities of the at-sea monitor will be to collect accurate weights on the discard portion of the catch as well as account for all catch (kept and discarded) on each tow. The work requires deploying trained at-sea monitors to meet coverage levels required by NMFS. NEFSC will train the contractor's monitors once the contract is awarded, as needed and at the Government's expense. The Contractor shall support, as specified, the at-sea monitors during each phase of their employment period, including training, briefing, travel, accomplishing requisite land duties, data collection on fishing vessels, and debriefings. The Contractor shall provide all necessary logistical and administrative support to deploy at-sea monitors on board vessels, normally out of ports from New York to Maine. This includes making travel arrangements, providing travel advances for monitors, and reimbursing for travel expenses. Vessels operate out of ports from New York to Maine in ocean waters, 3-200 miles offshore in all weather conditions. Typically, trips are 1- 14 days in duration. Vessels are generally 30-150 feet in length. Crew members and at-sea monitors live and sleep in cramped quarters, often in damp conditions and share common facilities. At-sea monitors must be willing to travel occasionally to cover locations other than their primary ports. Food is provided on multiday trips for the at-sea monitor and must be equal to the food being served to the rest of the crew. On single day trips, at-sea monitors must bring their own food and water.<br /><br />

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<AWARDEE>SRI International 333 Ravenswood Ave,	Menlo Park, CA 94025-3453
<DESC>NASA LaRC awarded a cost plus fixed fee contract to SRI entitled A Formal AnalysisFramework for Strategic Self-Separation The award results from a competitive selectionunder the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters released NASAResearch Announcement (NRA) for foundational research in support of the AeronauticsResearch Mission Directorate (ARMD), entitled "Research Opportunities in Aeronautics(ROA) 2010 under NNH10ZEA001N, Amendment 7, NextGen  Concepts and TechnologyDevelopment (CTD). CTD Project of NASAs Airspace Systems program has recognized that the greatestefficiency and capacity gains in the Next Generation (NextGen) Airspace system will comethrough humans delegating low-level air traffic management tasks to automated systems(either ground-based or airborne). CTD further recognizes this approach does noteliminate safety risk, but rather shifts risk from the human operators to theautomations design. Delegating tasks in this way has the effect of introducing anunprecedented level of automation into the national airspace system. Safety assessmentcosts of highly automated systems may reach 60% of total system cost. This cost may be solarge as to negate the advantages of increased efficiency and capacity.The current airspace system certainly relies on software, but this software is primarilyused in a way that informs human decision makers, who have alternate non-software sourcesof critical information (e.g. radar screens). These alternate sources provide a redundantcheck on the outputs of the software. NextGen concepts use automation not only to informoperators, but also to make safety-related decisions when managing aircraft. Forinstance, the NextGen concept of trajectory-based operations involves aircrafttrajectories that are generated, optimized, evaluated for conflicts, resolved ofconflict, and reported into system-wide information system through very complex softwaresystems. In a fundamental way, the safety of the airspace will depend upon the safety andcorrectness of software.The scope of this effort is to construct arguments (lines of reasoning showing that anair traffic management system is safe) and evidence (to show that the assumptions in thearguments are likely to be true) for high assurance of safety properties for conflictdetection and resolution systems.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) issued a firm-fixed-price GSA delivery order for Microsoft Datacenter and Systems Center Management software licenses and software assurance.  The delivery order was Call #0059 against SSA Blanket Purchase Agreement BPA SS00-09-40002  which was a limited-source "fair opportunity" among GSA resellers of Microsoft software.  The rationale for the justification is FAR 8.405-6(b)(3) - "the item is peculiar to one manufacturer (brand name item).  Only Microsoft Corporation and its resellers are capable of meeting SSA's needs.
