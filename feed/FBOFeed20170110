<DESC>The Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration (DOT, FAA), in partnership with the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Department of Commerces National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to stand up a cross-agency program titled Spectrum Efficient National Surveillance Radar (SENSR), to assess the feasibility of acquiring new surveillance solutions (potentially radar or non-radar) that may result in a consolidation of incumbent legacy surveillance radars (e.g. long range aircraft, short range aircraft, and weather surveillance), or a system of systems surveillance capability.   If successful, this effort may result in making the 1300  1350 MHz band available for reallocation to shared Federal and/or non-Federal use.

In compliance with the Spectrum Pipeline Act of 2015, the agencies are developing a SENSR Spectrum Pipeline Plan to seek funds from the Spectrum Relocation Fund (SRF) for this purpose. The SENSR Spectrum Pipeline Plan is expected to be submitted in September to the Technical Panel, which consists of representatives of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Commerce Departments National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The Technical Panel will approve or disapprove the Plan within 120 days of submission.  Before OMB can make the requested payment to the agencies, it will submit the approved plan to Congress, as required by the Spectrum Pipeline Act of 2015.

If the Plan is approved, and after Congressional notification,  the SENSR Program intends to issue a Request for Information (RFI) and hold an Industry Day, to initiate industry involvement. The RFI will seek industry input on the technical and project execution feasibility. The RFI is planned to be released in early FY17 with the Industry Day to follow shortly thereafter.

Introduction: This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice for project number 596A4-17-104 that requires Architect/Engineering (A/E) Services for the  Development of a Physical Security Risk Assessment and Survey  at the VAMC Lexington, KY  facilities and Community Based Outpatient clinics.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. ONLY THE A/E FIRMS RESPONDING TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT BY SUBMITTING AN SF330 PACKAGE ON TIME WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR INITIAL EVALUATION. NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330s. The A&E Services contract that is anticipated to be awarded will be procured in accordance with the Selection of Architects & Engineers Statute (Brooks Act - Public Law 92- 582), Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36.6 and VA Acquisition Regulation 836.6
Mileage Restriction: This procurement is restricted to Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB) located within a 450 mile driving distance from the Lexington VAMC (Leestown Division) located at 2250 Leestown Road, Lexington KY 40511. The 450 mile restriction will be verified by using the shortest driving distance from the Lexington VAMC  (Leestown Division) to a contractor s office from which the majority of the design services will be performed. This mileage restriction will be calculated using the following link: https://www.google.com/maps/dir//Lexington+VA+Medical+Center:+Leestown+Division,+2250+Leestown+Rd,+Lexington,+KY+40511/@38.0735535,-84.5738379,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x88424390a264f1c9:0xf486f401abf109c9!2m2!1d-84.5387326!2d38.0735587 
If said contractor s office is more than the 450 mile driving distance restriction to the Lexington VAMC (Leestown Division), the contractor s SF330 package will not be evaluated by the source selection evaluation board (SSEB) and will not be considered for award. This mileage restriction is in compliance with VAAR 805.207.
Contractors are required to place the address that must be utilized by the contracting officer on the first page (cover page) of the SF 330 package. No other address will be utilized when determining said mileage restriction.
Description: The Lexington VA Medical Center is seeking professional architect/engineering firms to bring VAMC Lexington, KY  facilities and Community Based Outpatient clinics into compliance with current U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Physical Security Design Manual (PSDM) for Life Safety Protected Facilities requirements with the development of a Physical Security Risk Assessment and Survey.  This project will require architectural and engineering services to provide professional consultative/engineering services to conduct a physical security risk assessment for the Lexington VA Medical Center and Community Based Outpatient Clinics for compliance with the VA Physical Security Design Manual (VA PSDM) (http://www.cfm.va.gov/til/PhysicalSecurity/dmphysecmc.pdf).  To meet this requirement, the facilities evaluated must have a clear, defined presentation of their vulnerabilities and defined proactive measures needed to reduce or mitigate such risk/vulnerabilities. To achieve this obligation the assessment requires the showing of fragile links of the vulnerabilities and a prioritization to enable realistic programs to be developed to undertake physical works to improve. 
It is the intent of the Department of Veterans Affairs to have the A/E fully survey, investigate, and document the existing space, and all systems necessary in order to gain the knowledge and insight necessary to prepare quality, accurate documents in a professional manner to accomplish the following:
Conduct Risk Analysis:  The contractor shall collect information and perform an evaluation of each facility (VA-Owned and Leased properties) for compliance with VA PSDM by surveying the physical facilities / site to include perimeter (reviewing lighting, pedestrian ways, parking facilities, and other facility features), all buildings and facility security access
Gap Analysis:  The contractor shall compare the existing building conditions to the VA PSDM identifying gaps and/or vulnerabilities.
At minimum, the contractor shall utilize the VA PSDM, VISN 9 PSDM Existing Medical-Related Leases (Life Safety Compliance Checklist) and/or VISN 9 PSDM Life Safety and Mission Critical Compliance Checklists to complete the gap analysis.
The contractor shall review and edit VISN 9 PSDM existing Medical-Related Lease (Life Safety Compliance Checklist) and VISN 9 Life Safety and Mission Critical Compliance Checklists as appropriate to ensure coordination/harmony with VA PSDM. 
Corrective Action(s):  The contractor shall develop appropriate as well as feasible corrective actions for each gap and/or vulnerability resulting from the Gap Analysis along with an order-of-magnitude estimate to correct each finding.
All offerors are advised that in accordance with VAAR 836.606-73 the total cost of the architect or engineer services contracted for must not exceed 6 percent of the estimated cost of the construction project plus any fees for related services and activities. Additionally, FAR Clause 52.236-2 (c) - Design Within Funding Limitation, will be applicable to this procurement action.  Design limitation costs will be provided to the most highly rated AE firm selected to complete the design.
Interested firms should submit their current SF-330 to Matthew.Cox@va.gov.  The SF-330s are due on January 26, 2017 at 4:00 PM Central Time (CT).  Use the instructions located in Attachment  SF330 Submission Instructions .
In accordance with FAR 36.209   Construction Contracts with A/E Firms and FAR 36.606 (c)   Negotiations, all interested contractors are hereby put on notice that no construction contract may be awarded to the firm that ultimately designs this requirement.
Security Issues, Late Bids, Unreadable Offers

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<RESPDATE>021417
<CONTACT>Kim Lopez, Sr. Subcontract Administrator, Phone 303-275-3681, Email kimberley.lopez@nrel.gov
<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), through the Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy (EERE) is issuing a formal Sources Sought for organizations interested in providing Systems Integration support for the DOE Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Program. This formal Sources Sought request will help identify organizations wanting to respond to a future Request for Proposal (RFP). In this case, submitting a proposal for the Sources Sought is a prerequisite for any applicant wishing to submit a response to a future RFP.
<p>Background: <br />The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Systems Engineering and Program Integration Office, in support of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is providing Systems Integration support for the DOE Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Program. This support includes four primary tasks:<br />1. Planning and coordination of the program's Annual Merit Review (AMR)<br />2. Compilation and integration of the Annual Progress Report (APR)<br />3. Support to the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technical Advisory Committee (HTAC)<br />4. Technical analysis for several subprogram and technical team areas.</p>
<p>The AMR is a 1,000+ person attended meeting with five (5) or more concurrent technical sessions. The AMR requires six months of planning with DOE staff, NREL staff and DOE contractors. The primary skillsets required for the AMR task include a dedicated meeting planning/facilitation expert, project management skills for leading a six month meeting planning effort and working with the meeting venue and sub-tier contractors as necessary, and technical editing skills for Microsoft PowerPoint files and Adobe PDFs files.</p>
<p>The Annual Progress Report is a yearly report published by the DOE Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Program that outlines the yearly technical results/progress of approximately 200 projects that the DOE Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Program sponsors. The primary skillsets required to carry out this effort include: project management and project tracking of the 200 individual technical reports that comprise the overall Report, change management to document edits received to individual reports, technical editing skills including graphic manipulation, MS Word editing, and PDF editing required to compile the final Report.</p>
<p>The HTAC is a federal advisory committee to the DOE Hydrogen and Fuel Cells program. The primary skills required for this task are meeting planning/facilitation skills for two annual HTAC meetings with approximately 50 total participants, project management skills required for planning the meetings and organizing support contractors as necessary (i.e. audio visual support), and technical editing skills associated with MS PowerPoint and PDF manipulation.</p>
<p>The technical analysis task includes general engineering analysis and note taking support for DOE technical teams. The engineering analysis may include general engineering analysis and techno economic analysis of hydrogen production pathways and &lsquo;green' vehicle technologies (i.e. fuel cell electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles). The note taking aspect of this task requires a person with a technical engineering background that interacts at technical team meetings to interpret and translate outcomes from the technical team meetings.</p>
<p>If interested, please provide your response and required information no later than February 6, 2017 to the NREL Primary Point of Contact. Sources Sought Information must include the following:<br />&bull; Point of Contact information (mailing address and email)<br />&bull; Description of potential project Team (include resumes as attachments).<br />&bull; Approaches to coordinating the logistics for technical meetings, both small and large.<br />&bull; Examples of past performance in the area of technical project support.<br />&bull; Technical experience in Hydrogen and Fuel cell areas, and working with NREL and EERE<br />&bull; Provide an example of a large technical document that the organization has prepared. <br />&bull; Provide examples of engineering and technical analysis, including the topic of engineering analysis provided.</p>
<p>Interested parties should send Sources Sought Information via email directly to: Kimberley.lopez@nrel.gov.</p>
<p>Sources Sought Information shall not exceed ten (10) pages (plus attachments) sent in a single PDF. The Sources Sought Information subject line should read as follows:<br />"Sources Sought "Technical and Logistics Support to NREL's Hydrogen Systems Integration Program"</p>

<p>Description:<br />The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager Integrated Training Environment (PM ITE), Product Manager Maneuver Collective Training Systems (MCTS) is planning a new acquisition for Modernization of existing Aviation Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (AVCATT) system. The AVCATT system consist of three trailers which have cockpit manned modules, Nonrated Crew Member Manned Modules (NCM3), and associated controller and operator stations. AVCATT systems located at multiple U.S. Army facilities. AVCATT provides combined arms and crew coordination (i.e., collective) training for U.S. Army cargo, utility, light utility, and attack helicopter pilots, co-pilots, and non-rated crew members. It includes associated Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUM-T) operations with Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). <br />PEO STRI is developing an acquisition approach and Period of Performance (PoP) for this effort. It is anticipated that this award will be made through a Best Value Trade Off approach In Accordance With (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15-101. This acquisition will require access to information classified as "Sensitive but Unclassified," and "For Official Use Only," and may require access to information classified as "Secret." Some documents will be International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR)-Restricted.</p>
<p>Background:<br />The Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) Capability Manager-Virtual &amp; Gaming (TCM-V&amp;G) provides combined arms and crew coordination training requirements for cargo, utility, light utility, and attack helicopters. The U.S. Army PEO STRI developed and fielded AVCATT to meet TCM-V&amp;G's combined arms and crew coordination or collective training requirements. PEO STRI is also responsible for AVCATT modernization and obsolescence mitigation / technical refresh.<br />The AVCATT initial operational capability was fielded in 2003 to support Army Aviation training. In 2014 the NCM3 was added to the AVCATT system. Today, AVCATT provides collective, combined arms and crew coordination proficiency training for AH-64, UH-60, CH-47, OH-58, and UH-72 pilots, copilots, and nonrated crew members. Each AVCATT Suite consists of a Battle Master Control (BMC) Trailer, an After Action Review (AAR) Trailer, and a NCM3 Trailer. The BMC Trailer is comprised of three reconfigurable cockpit manned modules, a system maintenance area, and an instructor/operator-role player station. The AAR Trailer is comprised of three reconfigurable cockpit manned modules and an AAR section. The NCM3 Trailer consists of two reconfigurable manned modules and two Instructor Operator Stations (IOS). AVCATT is transportable and used for training at various locations throughout the Continental United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, Korea, and Germany. There are currently 21 AVCATT Suites fielded. AVCATT is interoperable with Live Virtual Constructive-Integrating Architecture (LVC-IA), Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT), Games for Training (GFT), and Universal Mission Simulator (UMS).</p>
<p>The prospective AVCATT Modernization Contractor will be required to work in close coordination with the existing Maneuver Collective Training Systems (MCTS) Post Deployment Software Support (PDSS) Contractor. The MCTS PDSS Contractor is responsible for supporting and integrating the overall AVCATT Hardware (HW) and Software (SW) Configuration Management (CM) baseline. As such, the MCTS PDSS Contractor fields software updates/upgrades and some HW upgrades. In its role as CM manager, the PDSS Contractor supports multiple AVCATT modification contracts concurrently. PDSS Contractor support varies with each contract and project phase. Strict adherence to Systems Engineering (SE) Processes, Software Engineering Processes/Tools and teamwork are critical to the success of this contract. The prospective AVCATT Modernization Contractor will also be responsible for upgrades required to keep the trainer baseline concurrent with newly fielded aircraft capabilities as applied to collective training. Modernization efforts are successful when the modified AVCATT baseline is accredited for training by Fort Rucker's Directorate of Simulation (DOS) and delivered/fielded to Army Aviation Warfighters at training sites.</p>
<p><br />Performance Objectives:<br />The attached Draft Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Performance Work Statement (PWS) establishes the overarching scope for typical Delivery Orders (DOs) awarded under this ID/IQ contract. Performance objectives are established by AVCATT DO-specific PWSs, Specifications, and Contract Data Requirements Lists (CDRLs).</p>
<p>Government Furnished Equipment/Information (GFE/GFI): The Government plans to provide the following trainer equipment to support development and integration efforts as required by individual DOs:</p>
<p>AVCATT Synthetic Engineering Environment (SEE), which consists of one reconfigurable cockpit manned module and representative BMC and AAR stations; and a NCM3 manned module with a gunnery and sling load station.</p>
<p>At the time of potential contract award the Government plans to provide available information such as a working simulations of the CH-47F CAAS v9.2 and UH-60M v2.0 Operational Flight Programs (OFPs), trainer documentation and software source code necessary to operate, maintain, modify (e.g., upgrade, update), and repair AVCATT suites. [Note: Government anticipates that source code for the simulated CH-47Fv9.2 and UH-60Mv2.0 software will be available at contract award]. Future OFPs versions for the UH-60M and CH-47F will likely not be provided by the government so it will be a requirement of the Modernization Contract to modify the current simulated OFP baselines or replace them with a contractor provided alternative. The AVCATT program does not require OFPs to be simulated and is willing to consider approaches which integrate aircraft OFP software into the CH-47F and UH-60M simulators. Official GFI lists will be provided with each DO solicitation package.</p>
<p>At anticipated contract award the Government plans to provide working versions of the AVCATT AH-64D v13.1 and AH-64E v4.0 simulator baselines which will include re-hosted versions of their respective aircraft OFPs (to include source code), trainer documentation and additional software necessary to operate, maintain, modify, upgrade or update these baselines. For future AH-64D and AH-64E upgrades, the government anticipates that it will be able to provide partially complete aircraft OFP software source code.</p>
<p>Official GFI lists will be provided with each DO solicitation package.</p>
<p><br />ACQUISITION APPROACH:<br />The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement, if a requirement materializes. Based on the responses to this sources sought notice/market research, the AVCATT Modernization requirements may be separately set-aside for small businesses (in full or in part) or procured through full and open competition.</p>
<p><br />REQUESTED INFORMATION:<br />The Government is interested in receiving Industry Partners' insight on aforementioned anticipated acquisition. Responses should include the following information:</p>
<p>a) Company name, address, Point of Contact (POC), email addresses, phone and fax numbers, and company's web page (if applicable).<br />b) Identification of business size as it relates to Classification Code 69 and NAICS Code 333318, i.e. US large or Small Business (SB), service disabled veteran business, HUB Zone, 8(a) certified business, Woman Owned SB, etc.<br />c) Every page of your response must include your company name as well as page number, i.e., page # of 20. The maximum page count is 20 pages, 10 pages for the Request for Information and 10 pages for the Request for Technology Status and Trends. Font is not to be smaller than 12 points.<br />d) The Government is trying to ascertain industry partners' experience, capability, and ability regarding combined arms and crew coordination training systems product functionality and implementation. In this section's context, the words "Experience", "Capability", and "Ability" are used as follows:</p>
<p>"Experience": Extent to which industry partner has executed an effort equal (or mostly similar) to AVCATT Modernization successfully multiple times in the past with most, if not all, of the team that would be used for this effort.<br />"Capability": Extent to which an industry partner has institutional knowledge and resources to do the job right (e.g., experience, physical infrastructure and business capital resources, credentials, and mature institutional systems engineering processes are in place).<br />"Ability": Extent to which an industry partner will be ready to execute AVCATT Modernization effort at contract award (e.g., capability and Team are in place and ready, and On-The-Job (OJT) is not required).</p>

<p>This announcement is to Small Businesses, 8(a) Small Businesses, HUB Zone Small Business, Women Owned Small Businesses, Veteran Owned Small Business, and Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business concerns that may be interested in performing a contract for the Mid-Pacific Region of the Bureau of Reclamation. The work to be performed is described below. Based upon the responses to this announcement, the Government may determine to set this acquisition aside for total small businesses, further restrict the set aside, or proceed with an unrestricted solicitation. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 and the related small business size standard is $36.5 million. This notice is not a request for proposal and the information presented in this announcement will not obligate the Bureau of Reclamation in any manner. The estimated cost of this project is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000. This procurement will require a Bid Bond and 100% performance and payment bonds. Reclamation intends to use FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, and Request for Proposal, for this procurement and will be using a Quality Predominance, Tradeoff Process, within the Best Value Continuum. High quality, technical proposals will be required and evaluated to ensure the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Interested parties should include the following information in their response: <br />a. Business name, address, cage code, size classification based on NAICS size standard, socioeconomic classification, and a point of contact;<br />b. A positive statement of your intention to submit an offer for this solicitation as a prime contractor;<br />c. Evidence of your experience on projects similar in type and scope of work in this announcement within the last five years. The evidence should include: contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts and point of contracts with telephone numbers. Please do not include more than five past projects;<br />d. Include attachments cataloging the company's equipment assets, personnel resources, and financial resources that demonstrate company responsibility and capability, or the ability to obtain, the necessary production, construction, and technical equipment and facilities required perform this contract.</p>
<p>The work is located approximately 2.5 miles northeast of Mendota, CA in Madera County.</p>
<p>The principal components of work are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Construction of a reinforced concrete intake structure involving trash racks, slide gates and various other mechanical and electrical features. The reinforced concrete intake structure will include 10 entrance bays that will supply water to 2 box culverts.  <br />2. Construction of a reinforced concrete cast-in-place will be incorporated at the ends of the 2 box structures and extend over 1250 feet. The total concrete quantity exceeds 2500 cubic yards for intake and siphon features.<br />3. The construction work will require installation (permanent and temporary) sheet pile cofferdam and cutoffs walls. In addition to the sheet pile, a contractor designed dewatering and unwatering systems will be required. The importance of the dewatering is significant since it is necessary for acceptable construction means and methods for the inverted siphon and intake structure work.<br />4. Additional work involves significant excavation (in excess of 70,000 cubic yards) and placement of various compacted backfills (in excess of 65,000 cubic yards).</p>
<p>As discussed above, this best value procurement will require the submittal of technical proposals. The Government will evaluate offerors at a minimum regarding the following factors but others factors may be included as well. The contractor and subcontractor's past performance for work of a similar nature; their past performance for performing similar work within schedule and budget in a teaming arrangement; and the planned means, methods and resources to accomplish the critical features of the work in an environmentally sensitive manner meeting all environmental commitments.</p>
<p>System of Awards Management (SAM) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102, apply to this procurement. Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award. Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Information on SAM registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background<br /></span>The Library of Congress (Library) requires contract support to provide battery packs for the digital talking book machine (DTBM). The Library is responsible for maintaining over 400,000 DTBMs currently assigned to patrons and this includes periodic replacement of battery packs. A fully charged battery pack can provide over 40 hours of playback time on the DTBM. The Library requires the battery packs to consist of low self-discharge type cells to provide long life for DTBMs that may be infrequently connected to AC power. <br /><br />The Government anticipates a single-award, Firm-Fixed Price IDIQ with a five year ordering period (60 months) as the anticipated period of performance. <br />Sources Sought Instructions</p>
<p>This sources sought is a market research tool being used to (a) solicit industry input on the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW) and Specifications document and (b) determine potential sources that are capable of providing the services described herein prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>Specifically, the Library wishes industry feedback on the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Are the requirements for production of the battery packs clearly understood? Please list any ambiguity or discrepancies within the specifications.<br />2. Can the requirements be fulfilled with an existing commercial product without modification? If so please list the manufacturer and part number of the existing commercial product. <br />3. If there is no existing commercial product available to satisfy the requirements without modification then please give a high level overview of the changes required to an existing commercial product or the process for creation of a custom product in order to satisfy the requirements. Please include the following information in the response:<br />a. Manufacturer and Part Number of the commercial product to be modified or a brief summary of the specific requirement(s) that necessitate creation of a custom product<br />b. Description of the engineering services necessary for production<br />c. Description of the production tooling required for this item<br />d. Estimation of the time required for engineering services and tooling creation<br />e. Estimation of how many long lead components (if any) are required for production of this item<br />4. How will the vendor fulfill the requirement for certification that the self-discharge characteristic of the battery cells meets specification?<br />5. Can the battery packs, produced according to the technical specifications, be fully charged at the production facility such that they are delivered to the Library of Congress facility at near full capacity?<br />6. Are there any concerns regarding the technical specifications or quality assurance requirements for the battery packs?<br />7. Can you provide an estimated unit cost for the battery pack as defined and an estimated volume cost for quantities of 10,000 units, 25,000 units, 50,000 units, and 100,000 units?<br />8. Can you provide an assessment of the impact (if any) of market price fluctuations for raw materials required for construction of the battery packs on the cost of the battery pack over the life of this contract?</p>
<p>Interested parties are invited to submit a capability statement package, including responses to questions, inputs to the draft SOW, and relevant experience and expertise.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE strictly for market research purposes. THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY (NIST) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE
<p>The purpose of this notice is for planning purposes only and to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified business sources. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method.</p>
<p>NIST does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for information requested. No entitlement or payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by NIST will arise as a result of submission of responses to this notice and NIST's use of such information.</p>
<p>There will be no Question and Answer period associated this Sources Sought Notice.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large and small businesses that have the capability, experience, and expert knowledge in the area of conducting periodic expert assessments of Measurement and Standards Laboratories. The small business size standard for the applicable NAICS code of 541690 is $15.0M.</p>
<p>Statement of Objective</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>
<p>The mission of the U. S. Department of Commerce (DoC) National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve the quality of life for all Americans. To meet this mission, NIST has an ongoing requirement to acquire advice and studies, as permitted by federal law, to provide inputs to NIST to allow NIST to efficiently and effectively meet its mission requirements.</p>
<p>Because of this need, NIST seeks to establish contract vehicle that will streamline the process of contracting for these repetitive needs. That vehicle is an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract covering a 5-year period with a ceiling amount of $7.0 million. Individual task orders for specific needs could be negotiated between NIST and the Contractor under that IDIQ contract, with the terms and conditions up front for those task orders and specific needs and costs negotiated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide appropriately skilled personnel for this contract to perform what may be highly complex scientific and/or technical requirements for which very specialized or advanced education and/or experience may be required.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall actively manage the IDIQ contract and its individual task orders that may cover a broad spectrum of science and technical disciplines. It will be critical that the Contractor manage each task order requirement for scientific and/or technical services to ensure that: (1) the Contractor complies with all individual task order requirements; (2) the Contractor actively monitors and tracks Contractor status on meeting requirements of each task order; (3) the Contractor does not provide personal services (as defined in FAR 37.104), and (4) Contractor performance problems, if and when they should arise, are mitigated and addressed efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>2. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>In fulfilling its mission, NIST requires a periodic expert assessment of its Measurements and Standards Laboratories to meet two basic needs. First, a written report of the assessment is necessary to assure decision-makers within the federal government that NIST maintains the highest standards of effort, performance, and relevance. Second, the assessment process is a means for staff and management of the Laboratories to obtain direct feedback from the expert assessors regarding ongoing activities and other relevant issues within the Laboratories.</p>
<p>3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The scope of the IDIQ contract will include Contractor advice and studies to assist NIST and other DoC Bureaus in limited instances, with prior Contracting Officer Representative (COR) approval, in serving the United States industry and science in accordance with Sec. 107(b)(4) LABORATORY PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS of S. 3084 / Public Law 114-329 American Innovation and Competitiveness Act.</p>
<p>The contract may be used to acquire those types of services for NIST Measurement and Standards Laboratories, and in some limited instances, for laboratory programs within other DoC Bureaus. NIST Measurement and Standards Laboratories include the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Communications Technology Laboratory, Engineering Laboratory, Information Technology Laboratory, Material Measurement Laboratory, NIST Center for Neutron Research, and Physical Measurement Laboratory. In performing task orders under the IDIQ contract, the Contractor shall: <br />a) Perform the services as specified in each individual task order. Individual task orders will provide specific details of requirements.<br />b) Propose appropriately qualified Contractor personnel for specific task orders. This may involve recruiting appropriately qualified persons if the Contractor does not have appropriately qualified personnel on its staff. <br />c) Perform project management and contract administration for awarded task orders. <br />d) Comply with appropriate security processing requirements for contractors/subcontractors. <br />e) Provide appropriate personnel to serve as the Contractor Point of Contact/Coordinator with the NIST Acquisition Management Division, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), and NIST task order technical contacts/COR's for any contract issues and be responsible for resolution of problems.</p>
<p>4. CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The assessment of a NIST laboratory, supported by technical materials provided by NIST, and an onsite visit to the laboratory, should be conducted by a panel of experts. These individuals should be leaders in U.S. research, development, and manufacturing who are recognized by membership in prestigious scientific organizations, such as the National Academies of sciences, engineering, and/or medicine, with extensive technical expertise relevant to the laboratory being assessed. Consideration should also be given to individuals with deep expertise in metrology relevant to the technical area, such as sensor technical experts at other National Metrology Institutes (NIST is the U.S. National Metrology Institute). Given the breadth of the NIST mission, each panel should be composed of approximately one-half of members with primarily academic/public sector backgrounds, and one-half with primarily private sector/industrial backgrounds.</p>
<p>The assessment shall include consideration of the following broad criteria:</p>
<p>1. The technical merit of the current laboratory program relative to current <br />state-of-the-art programs worldwide;<br />2. The adequacy of the laboratory budget, facilities, equipment, and human resources, as they affect the quality of the laboratory's technical programs; and<br />3. The degree to which the laboratory program in measurement science, standards, and services achieves its stated objectives and desired impact.</p>
<p>5. DELIVERABLE</p>
<p>A final written report shall represent the consensus of the panel of experts and summarize the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the panel of experts.</p>
<p>6. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The Contractor shall maintain a quality control program to ensure that the requirements of each project are met. This program shall be created to identify and correct deficiencies and maintain a consistent, high quality of services before performance becomes unacceptable.</p>
<p>7. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA</p>
<p>The final written report will be reviewed by the COR with 30 days, for approval/non-approval, with will subsequently be forwarded to the CO to place in the contract file.</p>
<p>In order for a vendor to clearly convey their capability to fulfill the above-identified need, they MUST SUBMIT the following information:</p>
<p>1. Brief narrative providing evidence of the ability to conduct expert assessments of Measurements and Standards Laboratories, including an exemplar strategy for identifying panel experts and soliciting their participation in the assessments.<br />2. Capabilities Statement discussing core competencies.<br />3. Current socioeconomic status of your company including applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes. <br />4. Indication of whether your company currently has an active registration, including on-line representations and certifications at the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) website. Contractors must have a valid, current registration to be considered for award.<br />5. If any element(s) of the Statement of Objective (SOO) is/are considered a hindrance to competition, respondent shall include that information with its response, discussing how their approach differs from the stated requirements and results the Governments needs as stated in the SOO.</p>
<p>No telephone requests will be honored. All information provided will become property of NIST and will not be returned.</p>
<p>The synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.</p>
<p>No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement and any follow-up information requests.

<p><br />Background:</p>
<p>In 1967, the Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP), was established at NLM by a legislative mandate. NLM is the world's largest research library dedicated to improving the nation's health by collecting and disseminating the world's biomedical information.</p>
<p>The primary mission of the Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) TEHIP is to provide core information resources and services, facilitate access to national and international information resources, and to strengthen the infrastructure for toxicology and environmental health information. In support of this mission, SIS makes available on the web a suite of databases containing both factual and bibliographic information on environmental and health effects of chemical substances.</p>
<p>The advent of the web technology made it possible for SIS to extend the reach of its existing databases by hyperlinking to other information resources in and out of the government. Moreover, the web technology helped to make its information resources easily available not only to its traditional users such as toxicologists, industrial hygienists, healthcare providers, and regulatory specialists, but also to the public at large seeking information about the effects of exposures to chemicals substances in products that they use at home and at work.</p>
<p><br />Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p><br />The purpose of this procurement is to acquire non-exclusive rights to use the Consumer Product Information Database in accordance with the terms and conditions of a License Agreement. CPID will be used primarily to update the NLM Household Products Database https://householdproducts.nlm.nih.gov/</p>

Introduction:
This is a request for information only.  Do not submit a proposal or quote.  As a part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) market research process, this request for information (RFI) will be used to assist VA in finalizing the VA Enterprise Mobile Management (EMM) Performance Work Statement (PWS) and acquisition strategy. 
Additionally, there is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services described in this RFI.  Your response to this RFI will be treated only as information for the Government to consider.  You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this effort.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. In accordance with FAR 15.201(E), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this RFI will be the outcome of a competitive process.  Please address the following in your response:
Provide a brief summary of your technical approach to meet the requirements set forth in the PWS.  Additionally, please include any questions or comments on the Draft PWS.
Provide the team members, subcontractors, and/or vendors you plan to propose and the percentage of work each is to perform. 
Indicate whether at least 50% of the amount paid by the Government to the Prime Contractor will be paid to SDVOSBs as defined by VAAR 852.219-10 (JUL 2016) (DEVIATION).  PLEASE NOTE:  This should be considered in light of SBA guidance contained in the recently updated 13 CFR 125.6 and VAAR Clauses/Provisions 852.219-10 (JUL 2016) (Deviation) and 852.219-11 (JUL 2016) (Deviation).

Does industry pricing support expansion of EMM support by number of devices   i.e. optional task for support of 2,000 additional devices would include license, hosting, and O&M support associated with those devices.
VA wants a managed solution with the contractor handling all components of the solution and resolving issues whether they are software, cloud, or network based.  Is there anything missing from this PWS that is required for the contractor to provide a managed solution?
Is there anything included in the PWS that is unnecessarily costly, or not feasible for a contractor to provide?
Is any additional information required in the PWS for the contractor to provide an informed proposal?
Responses are due 01/20/2017 at 12 Noon EST to Joshua.Cohen2@va.gov and are limited to no more than 20 pages.

<CONTACT>WASHINGTONI NLN, Contracting Officer, Email washingtoni.NLN@ars.usda.gov
<DESC>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The USDA ARS - WBSC intends to award a sole source <strong>Firm Fixed Purchase Order (PO) to NOVEGENE CORPORATION, INC 823 ANCHORAGE PLACE, CHULA VISTA CA 91914.</strong> This order is to attain consistency &amp; continuity of research services: <strong>ADDITIOANAL PLANT RESEQUENCING (WGS - Library preparation, sequencing &amp; analysis, 3G raw data/sample) for 200 SPINACH PLANT SAMPLE SEQUENCING (HiSeq PE150, Q30&gt;80%)</strong> in support of the ongoing research at USDA ARS, CROPS IMPROVEMENT &amp; PROTECTION RESEARCH UNIT (CIPRU), SALINAS, CA. <br /><br />The Firm Fixed PO will include the following:
<p>- <strong>SPINACH PLANT RESEQUENCING, 200 SAMPLES &amp; BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSES:<br /></strong>&#61692;- Species Name: Spinach <br />&#61692;- Sample Type: Purified genomic DNA sample from tissues <br />&#61692;- Sample Number: 200 <br />&#61692;- Library Type: 350 bp insert DNA library <br />&#61692;- Data Output: 3G raw data/sample <br />&#61692;- Bioinformatics: Data Quality Control <br />&#61692;- Turnaround Time: 30 working days starting after we receive the library preparation confirmation from client</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USDA ARS, CIPRU's current research in breeding spinach to develop resistant/tolerant spinach varieties to biotic and abiotic stresses have relied on conventional breeding techniques in the past. Although this approach and other methods have yielded cultivars with improved characteristics, conventional breeding can be time-consuming and expensive; and acceleration by the utilization of molecular tools can reduce the time and cost of screening plants with desired characteristics. Although efforts have been initiated, basic molecular tools (genetic maps and markers) for spinach that can be used in molecular breeding programs are still lacking. The development of robust SNP markers and genetic maps would be a valuable resources for spinach breeding efforts for both the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DNA sequencing by next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies using improved double digest Restriction Site Associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq) and Genotyping by Sequencing (GBS) can be applied to a wide array of organisms, including plants, for genome sequencing and SNP discovery. The ddRADseq and GBS technologies are rapid and cost efficient approaches for trait mapping and association, and can be used in molecular breeding, allowing plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on any germplasm or species with or without prior knowledge of the genome. Therefore, using a NGS platform will be a valuable approach for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and marker-assisted selection (MAS) in spinach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Novogene is a leading provider of genomic services &amp; solutions with cutting edge NGS and bioinformatics expertise, and also, an Illumina Genome Network partner that has done work for some of the largest and most prestigious institutions around the world. Novogene's founder, Dr. Ruiqiang Li, is widely recognized as one of the world's leading experts in genomics and bioinformatics, owning 8 patents and authoring over 70 peer-reviewed publications that have been cited &gt;12,000 times. Best known for developing the software SOAP (Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package) for ultra-fast sequence mapping, variation detection, and de novo genome assembly, Dr. Li has focused Novogene's services on performing sequencing AND providing informatics to fully empower and enable their customers to move forward rapidly and effectively in their scientific endeavors. Novogene offers, not only, a track record of performance and reliability, but also, offers a range of NGS-based services for human, plant, animal and microbial DNA and RNA analysis at highly competitive prices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, USDA ARS, CIPRU has been working with Novogene in attaining DNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis for their ongoing spinach research. Therefore, it is highly critical &amp; required that the continuity of their services and the data results maintain their consistency &amp; validity. Overall, USDA strives to produce disease-resistant spinach varieties that will reduce the production costs including chemicals, machinery, fuel, and labor associated with pesticide spray; reduces workers' exposure to hazardous chemicals; reduce chemical contamination of soil &amp; ground water, alleviating the pressure on the environment; and ultimately, it benefits consumers with reduced pesticide residues and lower prices of spinach products, which in turn increase the acceptance and consumption of this nutritious leafy vegetable, improving their health and well-being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The award date will be on or about January 13, 2017</strong>; and this Notice of Intent is not considered as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) nor is it a Request for Proposals (RFP). No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis to award contract with General Dynamics Mission Systems (GDMS), 12450 Fair Lakes Cir Suite 800, Fairfax, VA 22033-3810. The contract scope will be for operational and maintenance and research and development support of the United States radionuclide stations (11 radionuclide particulate systems and four (4) radionuclide noble gas systems co-located with the particulate systems) monitoring stations. The period of performance will commence upon contract award and continue for up to five years thereafter (12-month base, and four 12-month options). The statutory authority for this non-competitive action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1). <br /><br />GDMS is the only contractor to ever build, deploy, operate, maintain, and sustain the US Radionuclide Particulate monitoring stations. No other contractor has experience operating, maintaining, or sustaining these stations because they involve one-of-a-kind technology sensors developed by GDMS. Award to any other source would result in unacceptable duplication of cost (&gt; $2.0M) and delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements while the new source came up to speed on the intricacies of the systems, which would require approximately five (5) years due to the unique nature of the equipment. Delays in this effort would severely limit the U.S. capability to detect, locate and identify nuclear explosions resulting in a degraded IMS. <br /><br />This notice of contract action is not a request for competitive proposals; no formal solicitation will be issued as a result of this announcement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the Government. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. A determination to proceed with this effort on a sole source basis based upon capability statements received and evaluated in response to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<RESPDATE>013117
<CONTACT>Matthew Robertson, Phone 2022547163, Email matthew.robertson@hq.dhs.gov
<DESC>Synopsis: <br />The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO), Assessments Directorate (ASD) anticipates conducting a series of  Graduated Rad/Nuc Detector Evaluation and Reporting (GRaDER) Program conformity tests against Technical Capability Standards and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards for various radiological and nuclear detection instruments and technologies.  These tests will be funded by the DNDO Standards Program.  DNDO will select vetted vendors to participate in these tests based on prior performance in DNDO radiological and nuclear detection technology research and development, as well as test and evaluation activities, rather than opening participation in this particular test campaign to all interested parties.
<p>Background:<br />The intent of the GRaDER program is to evaluate and report the performance of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) radiological/nuclear (rad/nuc) detection equipment against national consensus standards, as well as Technical Capability Standards adopted by DHS.  The program helps DNDO stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding the deployment of rad/nuc equipment. More information is available here:  https://www.dhs.gov/guidance-grader-program.</p>
<p>DNDO has already provided the opportunity for interested vendors to submit devices for testing in a series of government-funded radiological and nuclear detection technology conformity tests under the Interagency Characterization and Assessment Program (ICAP), and other DNDO test and evaluation programs or pilots.  To date no systems have achieved GRaDER compliance levels (1-3), and some systems proved insufficiently robust to complete the required testing.</p>
<p>Upcoming Test Program:<br />In an effort to most efficiently populate the GRaDER list with devices that are commercially available, the Government intends to conduct a series of test and evaluation campaigns that will be limited to devices most likely to satisfactorily complete the test campaign and also achieve a GRaDER compliance level.  Although all criteria have not yet been determined, it is likely that the test campaigns will be limited to commercially-available devices that:</p>
<p>-  Demonstrate some type of "vetting," such as being already in operational use in sufficient quantities to gauge operational applicability;</p>
<p>-  Have already participated in testing through a DNDO research and development or test and evaluation project; and</p>
<p>-  Have adequate assurance from the vendor that the device will survive the "run-in" time necessary to complete the entire test.</p>
<p>The test campaigns will be tailored for devices that have already shown the ability to come near to passing one of the three GRaDER compliance levels.  It is in the Government's best economic interest to limit participation in the upcoming test series to systems that have demonstrated satisfactory performance in other DNDO rad/nuc detection technology research and development, or test and evaluation activities.  This does not preclude the Government from conducting future "open admission" test campaigns; however this particular upcoming test campaign will be limited in some manner as described above.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals, nor is it a Request for Information.    The test campaign will not be subject to the Competition in Contracting Act, as there is no attendant procurement.  If you have any questions or comments concerning this notice (other than a request to participate) please submit them on or before 1700 PM EST 31 January 2017 in writing to DNDO via email.  Address is: matthew.robertson@hq.dhs.gov.   DNDO will publish future RFIs or selectively invite vendors to participate in this round of test campaigns.</p>

Background:  
The Cleveland VAMC will be replacing its current podiatric x ray unit at the Wade Park and Parma facilities. Currently these services are only offered at our Wade Park and Parma facilities, but the Cleveland VAMC will be adding these services at the Akron, Canton, Mansfield and Youngstown Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). This unit, CR plate reader, is utilized in the performance of Weight Bearing Feet and Ankle exams. The current Podiatry units at Wade Park and Parma are an older Computer Radiography (CR) system. These current units are beyond useful life and are no longer being supported by the manufacturer. The move to Direct Radiography (DR) is the newest technology that provides better quality imaging and simultaneously will reduce the dose of radiation to each patient significantly. This lower radiation dose is a most important benefit to our Veteran patients and DR is the gold standard in imaging technology worldwide. 
Specifications:  
Unit SHALL include a computer, x-ray tube, stand, hardware, software and DR Plate
SHALL be a floor unit
SHALL use DR Technology
SHALL be covered by no less than a 2 year warranty
SHALL be DICOM conformant
SHALL be ADA Compliant Ortho-base
SHALL include education/training
SHALL require no more than 10 seconds for image acquisition 
EVALUATION CRITERIA/ SUBMISSION OF OFFER
All Questions Shall be submitted in writing in response to the Solicitation and are due no later than Thursday 12 January 2017 at 3:00 PM EST. Questions shall be emailed to christopher.callihan@va.gov on or before the date and time stated. Any Government responses, answers, and or/comments to all questions will be posted by 13 January 2017. 
Contractor is responsible for verifying all existing field conditions.  Contractor assumes the responsibility of surveying the existing conditions as part of their performance.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for CSR Packaging Supplies. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These CSR Packaging Supplies products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for CSR Packaging Supplies in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for CSR Packaging Supplies will be established approximately May 2017 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately June 2017 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for CSR Packaging Supplies. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on CSR Packaging Supplies.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of CSR Packaging Supplies. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,258,025. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Sixteen items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 66.42% ($835,662) of the total volume in sales ($1,258,025). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their email submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br /><br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.</strong>
<p>1.	Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide documentation and date the DAPA number was applied for. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a DAPA number will not be considered for continued participation.<br />2.	Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement. <br />3.	Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement.<br />4.	Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors who do not continue to process application for a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for continued participation. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5.	<strong>Vendor offered products shall be TAA compliant. End-items offered shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered. </strong>Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought Notification. Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, Number of eaches in Unit of Sale, and country of origin. Only ONE Vendor Part Number (PN) should be provided for each item/sample. Vendor must send the same part number(s) for evaluation(s) as provided in response to the QSL FBO and as noted in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /><br /><strong>Required Products /	Annual Usage in Units </strong>/</p>

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Central Sterile Room (CSR) Wraps. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These CSR Wraps products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for CSR Wraps in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for CSR Wraps will be established approximately May 2017 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately June 2017 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for CSR Wraps. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on CSR Wraps.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of CSR Wraps. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement, this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,735,792.00. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Two items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 65.07% ($1,129,499.00) of the total volume in sales ($1,735,792.00). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their email submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br /><br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Bandage Adhesive Woven. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO South is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /><br /></strong>These Bandage Adhesive Woven products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Bandage Adhesive Woven in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, you must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item offered. If an item offered is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a waiver exists or if the Government will seek a waiver for the item. Unless a waiver exists or is granted, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />The QSL for Bandage Adhesive Woven will be established approximately May 2017 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately June 2017 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Bandage Adhesive Woven. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Bandage Adhesive Woven.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Bandage Adhesive Woven. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $142,025. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Two items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 60.61% ($86,087) of the total volume in sales ($142,025). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br /><br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Central Standard Time (CST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /><br /></strong>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>This clause implements the temporary policy provided by OMB Policy Memorandum M-12-16, Providing Prompt Payment to Small Business Subcontractors, dated July 11, 2012 (a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the contractor is required to make accelerated payments to small business subcontractors to the maximum extent practicable after receipt of a proper invoice and all proper documentation from the small business subcontractor. (b) Inclue the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts with small business concerns. (c) The acceleration of payments under this clause does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act. <BR> <BR>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause- "Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database" means the retired primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. "Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means- (1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Logistics Information Service to identify a commercial or Government entity; or (2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLA records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code." "Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. "Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number means the number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. "Registered in the SAM database" means that- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; (2) The Contractor's CAGE code is in the SAM database; and (3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record "Active". The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes. It includes- (1) Data collected from prospective federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government; (2) Prospective contractor submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.12; and (3) The list of all parties suspended, proposed for debarment, debarred, declared ineligible, or excluded or disqualified under the nonprocurement common rule by agencies, Government corporations, or by the Government Accountability Office. (b)(1) The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4. (3) If indicated by the Government during performance, registration in an alternate system may be required in lieu of SAM. (c) If the Contractor does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) A contractor may obtain a DUNS number- (i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The contractor should indicate that it is a contractor for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The Contractor should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business name. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company physical street address, city, state and Zip Code. (iv) Company mailing address, city, state and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company telephone number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) Reserved. (e) Processing time for registration in SAM, which normally takes five business days, should be taken into consideration when registering. Contractors who are not already registered should consider applying for registration at least two weeks prior to invoicing. <BR> <BR>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to- (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>This solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, pursuant to applicable regulations and guidelines.

<p><strong>Note to the Proposed Contractor</strong>:<br /><strong>Security Clearance<br /></strong>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the IHS (Indian Health Service). Before starting work requiring routine access to IHS facilities or systems each person must complete an FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an IHS employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for IHS processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an IHS site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of IHS sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The IHS utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the eQIP entry to the OPM (Office of Personnel Management) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract. Computers have been provided to the Service Unit for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>OIG Exclusion List<br /></strong>No contract award shall be made to a vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List (http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov) throughout the duration of the contract. Should a candidate be found with a non-favorable security clearance it shall be the contractor's responsibility to replace the candidate working under the contract/purchase order with a suitable candidate. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to notify the Acquisition Office is there is a change in provider.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the LEIE (HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the performance of the work, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to IHS is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour, or Cost-Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed-Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>The Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to a reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the investigation(s).</p>
<p><strong>EMPLOYEE HEALTH REQUIREMENTS<br /></strong>Contract Providers shall provide health information, proof of immunizations as recommended by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) concerning health-care workers in the United States. Health information must include previous immunization history and proof of the following immunization records: Hepatitis B (Vaccination-declination required), Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR), Varicella, Influenza, and Tuberculosis.</p>

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions,<br />activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.<br /><br />5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>

<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 9, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105 intends to award a Sole Source purchase order under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, Other Than Full and Open Competition procedures and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, to Pacific Bell Telephone Company, 12851 Manchester, Room 1-w-250, Des Peres, MO, 631 31-1802. This requirement is for the acquisition of fixed line telephone services such as ISDN, DSL, and Commercial Lines. There are 13 phone lines that cover services in the following locations: San Francisco CA, Richmond CA, Los Angeles CA, San Diego CA and Nevada.  U.S. EPA is requesting services for approximately 13 lines for these locations for twelve (12) months of service. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTE AND NO SOLICITATION WILL BE POSTED.

EPA believes Pacific Bell Telephone Company is the only source that can provide the specified telephone services to U.S. EPA, Region 9 while retaining existing telephone numbers and levels of service.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required supplies should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 10 days from the date of this announcement. The documentation provided must include sufficient detail to make a determination that competition is feasible. The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation is available. Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead submits only a routine or standard letter requesting a copy of the statement of work, or provides only basic corporate information will not be considered. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Inquiries to this notice must be in writing and should be addressed to James Hallman, Contracts Specialist, via email at hallman.james@epa.gov. Telephone or fax responses will not be considered.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(2) The cost of domestic components must exceed 50 percent of the cost of all the components. In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 431, this component test of the Buy American Act has been waived for acquisitions of COTS items (see 12.505(a)).</p>

<p>(c) Exceptions that allow the purchase of a foreign end product are listed at 25.103.

<DESC>The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) is soliciting offers under Request for Proposal (RFP) Number VA786-17-R-0006 to provide Interment and Grounds Maintenance and Janitorial Services at the Bakersfield National Cemetery. This acquisition is 100% set aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs). The NAICS Code is 561730; Size Standard is $7.5 Million. Offers received from concerns that are not SDVOSBs shall not be considered. SDVOSBs must be verified for ownership and control and listed in the Vendor Information Pages (VIP) at https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov prior to the due date for proposals. (See Provision 852.219-10 VA Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside.)

The Contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, equipment, materials, and the supplies necessary to provide Interment and Grounds Maintenance and Janitorial Services at the Bakersfield National Cemetery located at 30338 East Bear Mountain Boulevard in Arvin, CA 93203. The contractor shall use an innovative and creative technical approach to manage the grounds maintenance operation at the Cemetery in order to maintain the high standards of appearance as a National Shrine, in accordance with the National Cemetery Administration National Shrine Commitment Operational Standards and Measures (Version 5.1 July 2014, or the most current version), and standard commercial practices.. The contract period of performance is from February 1, 2016 (or effective date of award of contract), through September 30, 2017, with four (4) one (1) year option periods to begin on the first day of the fiscal year, if exercised.    

PRE-BID SITE VISIT: Potential offerors are urged and expected to inspect and investigate the performance site by observation. Offerors are also urged to submit Requests for Information (RFI) and responses through the Contracting Office to satisfy their understanding of the work to be completed as well as all general, local, and technical conditions that may affect the cost and feasibility of the proposal. In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after award. 

There is only one organized site visit: 01/17/2017 at 11:00am. (PST). If you are not able to attend, you may do a self-guided visit. There will be no Cemetery Personnel available at that time to show you around and you must call the COR to make sure he/she knows you will be there.

The Government intends to award a single, Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract to the responsible offeror whose offer is evaluated as the lowest-priced and technically acceptable (LPTA). The total price shall include all labor, travel expenses (if any), materials, overhead profit, insurance, and all other expenses necessary to deliver and install the required items. No additional sums will be payable on account of any escalations in the cost of materials, equipment, or labor, or because of the Contractor s failure to properly estimate or accurately predict the cost or difficulty of achieving the results required by this contract. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the LPTA offeror.

The following factors listed in descending order of importance will be used to evaluate offers: (1) Price, (2) Past Performance; and (3) Technical Qualifications.  Past Performance and Technical Qualifications when combined are not more important than Price. However, TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS AND PAST PERFORMANCE MUST BOTH BE SATISFACTORY FOR THE OFFER TO BE CONSIDERED  TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE.  SIMPLY HAVING THE LOWEST PRICED BID DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY CONSTITUTE GROUNDS FOR CONTRACT AWARD.

Bonding:  The Government retains the right to ask for bonding (bid, performance, payment) if it is determined to be necessary to address Government concerns.  In such cases, the Government will reimburse 100% of the bonding price. Failure to receive or qualify for bonding will result in removal from further consideration for award. The Experian Credit Report will be one of the tools used to determine if bonding should be required due to the business financial stress score/summary. The number of contracts outstanding will be another consideration in determining if bonding will be needed.  Failure to obtain bonding within a reasonable time will result in withdrawal of award and discussion with the next best offer.  If bonding is not required, the prime contractor is required to notify all subcontractors that there is no bonding on the contract.  Reference FAR 52.228-16 Performance and Payment Bonds   Other than construction.

Electronic solicitations will be available for download from Federal Business Opportunities http://www.FedBizOpps.gov on or around January 10, 2017. Responses to the solicitation are due by 4:00 p.m. (EST) on or about January 24, 2017. The question and answering period commences on January 10, 2017 and concludes on January 19, 2017 by 5:00 p.m. EST. Email questions to anthony.hawley@va.gov. Offerors are advised that they are responsible for obtaining amendments to the solicitation which will be available at FedBizOpps.

All proposals must be submitted through the Department of Veterans Affairs - Electronic Management System (eCMS) Vendor Portal website in order to be considered for award.  https://www.vendorportal.ecms.va.gov. Please go to the VA eCMS Vendor Portal website at https://www.vendorportal.ecms.va.gov to register.  Once on the webpage, proceed to the Vendor Portal Login Section located on the far left side of the webpage and click on  Request a user account  to register. In the event an Offeror is unable to submit a proposal through the Vendor Portal Domain prior to the proposal closing date, contact the VAAS helpdesk at 1-877-634-3739, or via email at VA.Acquisition.Systems@va.gov .

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Experimental Immunology Branch (EIB), has a requirement for the maintenance of one (1) Government-owned Becton Dickinson &amp; Company (BD) FACSARIA II Special Order 6-Laser System; and one (1) BD LSRFortessa Special Order 5-Laser Flow Cytometry System.<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation, #N02CO72512-8, is issued as a request for quote (RFQ), and includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-92-1 / 12-19-2016, simplified acquisition procedures for commercial items.
<p><br />The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219 and the business size standard is $20,500,000.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract for severable services.</p>
<p>The period of performance shall consist of a base period of twelve (12) months, plus one 12-month option period, as follows:</p>
<p>BASE PERIOD: February 1, 2017 - January 31, 2018<br />OPTION PERIOD: February 1, 2018 - January 31, 2019</p>
<p><strong>Description of Contractor Requirements<br /></strong><br />The Experimental Immunology Branch (EIB) Flow Cytometry Facility provides basic research support to members of the EIB as well as to investigators throughout CCR, NCI. Currently, support is provided 5 days per week to approximately 75 users. Each instrument supports multiple experiments each day, and each instrument is fully utilized. There are no available backup instruments. The experiments performed involve costly reagents, expensive animals, and multiple man-hours. When an instrument malfunctions, or does not operate optimally, these costly experiments are lost. It is therefore necessary that all instrumentation operate in an optimal fashion, and that down time due to malfunctions and repair time be minimized. Because the nature of the equipment is highly experimental, the OEM routinely designs and implements software and hardware improvements to the instrumentation. It is essential to the EIB that these revisions be installed efficiently in order to maintain optimal performance.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SCOPE<br /></span>The Contractor shall provide all labor, material and equipment necessary to provide maintenance for the following two (2) Government-owned flow cytometry systems, in accordance with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)'s latest established service procedures:</p>

<p>Please refer to RFQ # <strong>N02CO72512-8</strong> on all correspondence.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BASIS FOR AWARD<br /></span>The Government intends to make an award to the Quoter whose quotation provides the best overall value to the Government. Selection of a Quoter for award will be based on an evaluation of quotations against four factors. The factors, in order of importance are: technical, personnel requirements and organizational experience, past performance and price. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. However, cost/price may become a critical factor in source selection in the event that two or more quoters are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of all factors other than cost/price. The process described in FAR 15.101-1 may be employed, which permits the Government to make tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors to consider award to other than the lowest price quote or other than the highest technically rated factor.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Contractors in relation to the needs set forth in the combined synopsis/solicitation. The merits of each quote will be evaluated carefully. Each quote must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the combined synopsis/solicitation.</p>
<p>The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information which is not identified in the quote. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may not be requesting revisions to Quotations, so Quoters should provide their best solution and price in response to the solicitation.</p>
<p>NOTE: Quoters must submit information sufficient to evaluate their quotation based on the detailed factors listed below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE EVALUATION PROCESS AND FACTORS<br /></span>The Government will award a contract resulting from this RFQ to the responsible quoter whose quotation, conforming to the RFQ, will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following evaluation factors shall be used to evaluate the prospective Contractors and are listed in order of importance:</p>
<p>1. Technical Approach (60 points)<br />2. Personnel Requirements and Organizational Experience (40 points)<br />3. Past Performance (Acceptable/Unacceptable)<br />4. Price (Price will be evaluated separately but not scored)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Price Quote:</span></p>
<p>The quoter shall prepare a price quotation that contains all information necessary to allow for a comprehensive evaluation of the price quoted. Specifically, each quote must include the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Federal Tax Identification Number (TIN); <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; - Business Size (e.g., small or large)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA</span></p>
<p><strong>1. Technical Approach:</strong> (60 points):</p>
<p>The Quoter will be evaluated by the quality and reasonableness of the proposed technical plan as evidence of understanding of the scope, purpose, and complexity of the requirements as described in the Statement of Work (SOW) in enough detail that someone with a rudimentary knowledge of the subject would be able to understand the quoter's ability to perform the work. The proposed technical plan shall demonstrate the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Shall show evidence of previous work performed for at least three (3) past clients with Becton Dickinson instrumentation, that meets the standards required in the SOW. <br />&bull; Shall demonstrate the ability to provide service by a certified factory-trained Field Service Engineer within 48 hours of the Government's service request.<br />&bull; Shall demonstrate the ability to provide unlimited telephone support, for troubleshooting and onsite training by certified factory-trained technical support engineer and application specialists as stated in the SOW.<br />&bull; Shall demonstrate the ability to re-install software and/or provide updates as needed, at no additional cost to the Government.<br />&bull; Shall demonstrate the ability to perform all repairs and adjustments necessary, using OEM parts to restore the equipment to normal and efficient operating condition.</p>
<p><strong>2. Personnel Requirements and Organizational Experience:</strong> (40 Points):</p>
<p>The Quoter will be evaluated by the appropriateness and adequacy of the proposed project personnel and organization experience as it relates to the completion of the requirements in the SOW, including the responsibilities and level of effort for all personnel who will be assigned to the contract. Staff as well as their detailed qualifications must be described. The key personnel assigned to this contract shall include: Certified factory-trained service engineers, certified technical support engineers, and application specialists. The Contractor shall provide a copy of the certificate of key personnel that will be performing the work stated in the SOW. Contractor shall also include the following in their quote:</p>
<p>&bull; Demonstrate knowledge and expertise on servicing and troubleshooting Becton Dickinson instrumentation that meets the standards required in the SOW. <br />&bull; Demonstrate that certified factory-trained personnel have a minimum of three (3) years factory training and experience in the servicing of Becton Dickinson instrumentation that meets the standards required in the SOW.<br />&bull; Demonstrate that all primary service personnel shall have at least one backup Field Service Engineer with at least the same level of expertise on the equipment covered by this purchase order.</p>
<p><strong>3. Past Performance</strong> (Acceptable/Unacceptable)</p>
<p>Quoters shall submit the following information as part of their response:</p>
<p>&bull; A list of at least three (3) contracts providing similar services working onsite at the client's facility containing the instrument listed in the SOW completed during the past ten years and all contracts currently in process that are similar in nature to the services requested in the SOW. Contracts listed may include those entered into by the Federal Government, agencies of state and local Governments and commercial concerns. Quoters may also submit past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or Sub Contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Quoters that are newly formed entities without prior contracts should list contracts and subcontracts as required above for all key personnel. The list of contracts is preferably related to past experience with the Becton Dickinson instrumentation as listed in the SOW, as experience with other instrumentation may be irrelevant.</p>
<p>Quoters shall include the following information for each contract or sub contract:</p>
<p>1. Name of Contracting Organization<br />2. Contract Number (for subcontracts, provide the prime contract number and the subcontract number)<br />3. Contract Type<br />4. Total Contract Value<br />5. Description of Requirement<br />6. Contracting Officer's Name and Telephone Number<br />7. Program Manager's and Telephone Number<br />8. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code</p>
<p>&bull; The Quoter shall provide specific past performance information on issues encountered with the same or similar instrumentation mentioned in the SOW; identify applicable contracts; and provide corrective actions taken in order to resolve.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the Quoter; other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each Quoter. Performance risks are those associated with a Quoter's likelihood of success in performing the requirements as indicated by that Quoter's record of past performance.</p>
<p>The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an quoter's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers all available and relevant information.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 0002 Effective 1/10/17. The purpose of Amendment 002 is as follows: 1. Decrease Line Items quantities, Delete Quantity Lines for 2, 15,16,18 and 25. 2.  Extend solicitation close date to read Tuesday, 17 January @ 10AM. 3.  Question 0001:  On some of these cable assemblies,  the BOM specifies Techflex "Flexo Pet" expandable sleeving in black (P/N: PTN0.25BK) while other cable assemblies are specifying Western Filament PT0250 (WF_FR0250BK), which is the same material, color and size. In order to reduce minimum quantity buys, would it be okay to use the Techflex product on all cable assemblies which call for " black PET expandable tubing?     Answer 0001 As long as the items are technically identical, we have no problem (i.e. as long as the flex sleeving is 1.4" and black we have no problem with them using just Tech Flex or another brand). 4.  Question 0002  Post award, prior to start of work, will the government be able to provide physical examples or photographs of the cables?  Many of the drawings do not specify dimensions for label placement locations, and the go-by examples or photos would be helpful.     Answer 0002 Yes, the government will be able to provide photos as samples to show the winning contractor the approximate build of previous cables and they can use it as reference for location of labels and other un-specified information.  5.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the replacement of the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory (SEPRL) at the U.S. National Poultry Research Center in Athens, GA. This SEPRL Modernization Project will be implemented by the Design-Build project delivery method and will involve the design and construction of an entirely new research campus. The USDA has developed a set of Bridging Documents (plans and specifications) showing and describing the project's essential elements.
<p>BACKGROUND: The SEPRL staff currently conducts research activities in more than thirty buildings with a combined floor area of approximately of 80,000 Gross Square Feet (GSF) on a thirty-two acre site. The offices, laboratories, conference and animal facilities are outdated, poorly equipped and overcrowded. Since the construction of the campus in the 1960s, the scope and objectives of SEPRL's research mission have changed, resulting in the facilities' inability to properly support the research necessary to lead the nation and the world in the control of devastating poultry and zoonotic diseases such as avian influenza. <br /><br />REQUIREMENT: The selected Design Build Contractor (DBC) will be required to provide all of the necessary professional architectural and engineering services. <br /><br />The scope of this contract will require the DBC to demolish 29 buildings occupying approximately 69,000 GSF, to construct four new main buildings occupying approximately 255,000 GSF, some smaller support buildings, and to completely replace all of the existing utility systems.</p>
<p>The four new main buildings will consist of: 1) Building (B)45, a two story, laboratory, office, and administration building occupying about 67,000 GSF; 2) B46, an Animal Biosafety Level- 2 (ABSL-2) poultry holding facility with a main floor, penthouse and basement, with a floor area of about 87,000 GSF; 3) B47, consisting of: a) Biosafety Level-3 Enhanced (BSL-3E) laboratories, b) Animal Biosafety Level-3 Enhanced (ABSL-3E) poultry holding facilities; and c) Biosafety Level-3 Agriculture (BSL-3AG) animal holding facilities, housed on a main floor, a two level penthouse, a basement and a mezzanine, with a combined area of approximately 89,000 GSF; and 4) B49, a hatchery and brooding facility with a main floor and basement covering about 12,000 GSF.</p>
<p>BASE: <br />Base Item - All project design and construction work is contained in the Base Item, except for the Optional Items described below.</p>
<p>OPTIONS:<br />OPTION 001 - Provide and install in B46 a new tissue renderer and all of its associated utilities as shown in the Bridging Documents (BD) plans and specifications.</p>
<p>OPTION 002 - Provide all labor, material and equipment to upgrade the HEPA filter boxes in B47 with an automatic scan testing feature. This option shall also include providing two automatic scanning systems complete with all necessary equipment needed to perform the automatic scan.</p>
<p>OPTION 003 - Provide all labor, material and equipment to construct a pre-engineered building (B50) as detailed on the BDs. The DBC may use this building for storage during the construction duration and prior to the Government's taking ownership of the building. The warranty period for this building will not start until Government takes ownership of the building.</p>
<p>GENERAL:<br />The contract performance time is approximately 2008 calendar days (Base and all Optional Items) after the issuance of the Notice to Proceed. Total Design-Build cost is estimated to be more than $100 million.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are 236220 (Construction), 541310 (Architect) and 541330 (Engineering), with a size standard of $33.5 million for construction and $4.5 million for architectural and engineering services.</p>
<p>This project will be initiated by a two-phase design-build solicitation. This procurement is being issued on an unrestricted basis using full and open competition utilizing the negotiated method by issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>The solicitation criteria relies upon industry standards, where allowable, to afford the offeror a degree of design flexibility while meeting certain specific project requirements. The successful DBC must design and construct complete and useable facilities, as described in the RFP documents.</p>
<p>One solicitation will be issued covering both phases. Phase One is the pre-selection phase. This phase does NOT include the submission of a price proposal.</p>
<p>Evaluation factors under Phase One may consist of the following: Bonding, Project Management, Special Experience &amp; Technical Capacity and Past Performance.</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated in Phase One to determine which offerors are eligible to submit proposals for Phase Two, and an amendment to the RFP will be issued to those selected offerors (maximum of four). The detailed project performance requirements for this project will be included in the amended RFP package for Phase Two.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Factors for Phase Two will consist of the following: Technical Solutions, Oral Presentations, the Design-Build Team, and Small Business Utilization.</p>
<p>Sub-contracting plans are required for all construction contracts awarded to a large business when the award amount exceeds $1,500,000. If the offeror is a large business, the firm will be required to submit a sub-contracting plan as part of its proposal package during Phase Two of the solicitation.</p>
<p><br />The contract will be awarded, based on the Best Value "Trade-off" process, to the firm whose proposal, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, provides the best combination of design features and cost or price reasonableness. In making this determination, all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. The Government reserves the right to make the contract award to other than the lowest price offeror, price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>Bid Bonds are required. Performance and Payment Bonds will be required by the successful offeror. It is anticipated that the solicitation documents will be available for viewing and downloading on FedBizOpps (www.fedbizopps.gov) on or about December 22, 2016.</p>
<p>Plans and specifications will NOT be provided in hard paper copy. The solicitation and all amendments for the RFP will be posted on www.fbo.gov</p>
<p>Proposals are due on or about January 23, 2017, at the George Washington Carver Center (GWCC), ATTN; Michael Wigfall, 5601 Sunnyside Avenue, Beltsville, MD 20705-5123. Due to the heightened security at Government buildings, offerors are encouraged to send their proposals via overnight mail.</p>
<p>If proposals are sent via regular mail, please allow an additional five (5) days for mail scanning. Couriers will not be allowed to drop proposals off at the security desk; they must take them to the mail room located at the back of the building and therefore must do so in enough time to meet the date and time for receipt of proposals. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.</p>
<p>Offerors will have the maximum timeframe expressed in calendar days below to develop proposals in response to Phase 1 and Phase 2. In Phase I, the Government will evaluate Performance Capability proposals to "Shortlist" a maximum of four (4) of the most highly qualified Offerors. ONLY those firms selected in Phase I will be allowed to participate in Phase II.</p>
<p>a. PHASE 1 - 30 Calendar Days</p>
<p>b. PHASE 2 - 30 Calendar Days</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the contractor to check www.fbo.gov frequently for any amendments or changes to the solicitation. The Government is not responsible for any loss of internet connectivity or for an offeror's inability to access the documents posted at the referenced website. No copies on electronic storage (USBs, DVDs, CDs, etc...) or hard copies will be made available.</p>
<p>If an offeror would like to be listed so that others can see that the offeror is an interested vendor, the offeror must click the "Add Me to Interested Vendors" button in the listing for this solicitation on www.fbo.gov</p>

<p>The Government is making available the NATO Reference Mobility Model (NRMM). The NATO NRMM is a computer-based simulation tool that can predict a vehicle's steady-state operating capability over specified terrain. The NRMM was developed and proven by the Waterways Experiment Station (WES) and the Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) over several decades. The NRMM has been revised and updated throughout the years; the current version used to perform this analysis is version 2, also known as NRMM II.</p>
<p>The NRMM II software is managed by the US Army Corps of Engineers - Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC). NRMM is only releasable to Department of Defense (DoD) and DoD contractor personnel for approved purposes. Requestors must submit a distribution agreement to obtain access. The agreement covers various aspects of NRMM use and redistribution, which also provide insights on network security requirements for those who use it. It's not classified, but it is ITAR restricted. To obtain a copy of the NRMM II Software, please follow the instructions below.</p>
<p>1) Complete and sign the Requesting Organization information blocks on the top of page 4 of the NRMM Distribution Agreement and forward via email to usarmy.detroit.acc.mbx.fmtv-a2@mail.mil</p>
<p>2) If approved, the POC identified in the Distribution Agreement will receive an email from the US Army Corps of Engineers with instructions on how the software will be provided.</p>

<DESC><p>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis to award contract with General Dynamics Mission Systems (GDMS), 12450 Fair Lakes Cir, Fairfax, VA 22033-3810. The contract scope will be for operations and maintenance, recapitalization, and research and development support of the United States International Monitoring System (IMS) radionuclide monitoring stations (11 radionuclide particulate systems and four (4) radionuclide noble gas systems co-located with the particulate systems). The period of performance will commence upon contract award and continue for up to five years thereafter (12-month base, and four 12-month options). The statutory authority for this non-competitive action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1). <br /><br />GDMS is the only contractor to ever build, deploy, operate, maintain, and sustain the US IMS Radionuclide Particulate and Noble Gas monitoring stations. No other contractor has experience operating, maintaining, or sustaining these stations because they involve one-of-a-kind technology detection system implemented by GDMS. Award to any other source would result in unacceptable duplication of cost (&gt; $2.0M) and delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements while the new source became proficient on the intricacies of the systems, which would require approximately five (5) years due to the unique nature of the equipment. Delays in this effort would severely limit the US capability to detect, locate and identify nuclear explosions resulting in a degraded IMS.<br /><br />This notice of contract action is not a request for competitive proposals; no formal solicitation will be issued as a result of this announcement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the Government. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this notice. A determination to proceed with this effort on a sole source basis based upon capability statements received and evaluated in response to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>DRAFT Spectrum Efficient National Surveillance Radar Program (SENSR) RFI

In calendar year 2017 the Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration working in coordination with the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration intends to post a formal Screening Information Request (SIR) Request for Information (RFI) to assess the feasibility of making the 1300  1350 MHz band available for reallocation to shared Federal and/or non-Federal use by acquiring new surveillance solutions.  Such a change may result in a consolidation of incumbent legacy surveillance radars (e.g., long-range aircraft, short-range aircraft, and weather surveillance) or a system of systems surveillance capability.  This release of a draft RFI provides industry the opportunity to review and comment on the initial stages of the governments approach.   Please note that this is a draft release of the RFI and it is not intended that industry respond in accordance with the directions therein.  


Industry will be provided with the opportunity to receive an introduction to the Program and meet with the government representatives of this Program at the 2016 Air Traffic Control Association (ATCA) Annual Conference.

<DESC>The purpose of amendment 2 is to answer the following list of questions: <br /><br />Question 1: We believe that FDA may benefit from a flexible data integration platform to join, verify, refresh, and model data from a wide array of sources, including inventory farm data, publicly available data sets such as Dun and Bradstreet or US Farm, as well as the agency's proprietary data. If this would be of interest, would the FDA be willing to entertain a response that envisions how such a project may be implemented? Alternatively, we would also welcome the opportunity to meet with the relevant program owners to demonstrate how we have supported similar work at other institutions.
<p>Answer: This is out of scope of the requirement and the FDA does not see additional benefit from going down this path. The systems that will intake this data already has a contractor assigned so it will not be in benefit for the FDA. Our immediate and pressing need is basic information about the names and locations of farms in the United States who are or maybe subject to the Produce Safety Rule.</p>
<p>Question 2: One of the viable information source that we have identified is "US Farm Data" and the solicitation references "US Farm" in question #2. Are these two one and the same?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, the reference to "US Farm" in question #2 refers to "US Farm Data".</p>
<p>Question 3: We can acquire and provide data for foreign farms. Do you currently have specific countries that are of top interest to FDA?</p>
<p>Answer: This list is not all inclusive but would be primarily consist of the following:</p>
<p>Mexico, Canada, Guatemala, Ecuador, Chile, Costa Rica, Honduras, Dominican Republic, Peru, Netherlands, New Zealand, China, Argentina, Colombia, Spain, Italy.</p>
<p>It would also be nice to have: Israel, Korea, Brazil, Japan, Belgium, Thailand, Jamaica, Nicaragua, India, South Africa, Philippines, Morocco, France Vietnam, West Bank, Grenada, El Salvador, Belize, Uruguay, Panama, Haiti, and Australia.</p>
<p>Question 4: Most data vendors require their data to be purged after the agreed period ends. Do you foresee this to be a problem after this contract has ended? We can make an arrangement to overcome this issue but wanted to know in advance since it may affect our pricing.</p>
<p>Answer: FDA would desire to at least maintain an archive copy of the data (at least in hard copy). FDA would also consider the data its own data after we have visited or called the farm and verified the accuracy of the information. For example, once we went to a farm and did an inspection, we would consider the inventory information FDA gathered information. Likewise, if we did an informational visit to the farm and verified the accuracy of the information we would consider it our own.</p>
<p>Question 5: Besides loading the data to FDA, would FDA need further data management support such as data cleansing, analytics, reporting, etc?</p>
<p>Answer: Once the data is received as per the requirement, FDA currently has supporting resources to load the data into the FDA system.</p>

<DESC>11 January 2017:&nbsp; This is an INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT by Fleet Readiness Center Western Pacific (FRCWP) for Aviation Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) services in support of United States Navy and Marine Corps F/A-18A-F and EA-18G aircraft. This notice is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. The planned industry day will serve as a market research tool, both for informing industry of United States Government (USG) requirements for F/A-18A-F and EA-18G MRO services and for determining industry's interest, awareness and capabilities for providing those services. The industry day forum will allow for networking among interested service providers and lead to USG awareness of industry's capabilities for supporting the F/A-18A-F and EA-18G. <strong>FRCWP will host the Industry Day on 8-9 March 2017 at MCAS Iwakuni, Japan, beginning at 9:00 AM and ending at 4:00 PM each day</strong>.
<p>FRCWP uses USG contracts with MRO service providers to support aircraft maintenance. In general, requirements will consist of Integrated Maintenance Plan (IMP) and In-Service Repair (ISR) support. FRCWP is particularly interested in identifying potential service providers for its upcoming F/A-18A-F and EA-18G IMP and ISR support requirement. Aviation MRO service providers will have the opportunity to learn about FRCWP's mission, to meet with contracting personnel from Fleet Logistics Center Yokosuka (FLCY) and Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and to tour the relevant facilities on Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni, Japan. There will be limited availability for one-on-one sessions on 9 March for interested service providers. Depending on the number of companies attending, the one-on-one sessions are anticipated to be held in 45-minute intervals on the hour by appointment only. If questions arise during the one-on-one sessions that cannot be answered in person, those answers will be published on FEDBIZOPPS after the event.</p>
<p><strong>Advance registration for this event is required</strong>. Parties interested in attending the industry day and the one-on-one sessions must submit a reservation request via email to Mr. Kurt Dronenburg at kurt.dronenburg@fe.navy.mil and to Mr. Seiji Yoshino at seiji.yoshino.ja@fe.navy.mil. Requests shall include the company's name, the names and titles of participating individuals, and contact information to include telephone numbers and email addresses. Participating companies are further requested to provide CAGE and NAICS codes if available. No more than four participants per company may register. Registration submittals must include MCAS Iwakuni Base Access requests per the attached four (4) files.

<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity.</p>
<p>Department of the Navy, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD) Lakehurst, NJ</p>
<p>2. Nature/Description of Action(s) Being Approved.</p>
<p>This is a justification to award a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase III contract to Electro Standards Laboratories (ESL).</p>
<p>ESL and NDI Engineering Co. were awarded SBIR Phase I contract numbers N00178-03-C-3042 and N00178-03-C-3041 respectively on 16 December 2002, resulting from Solicitation 02.2, Topic N02-133. Topic N02-133 was titled, "Sensorless Control of Linear Motors." ESL and NDI Engineering Co. were subsequently awarded SBIR Phase II contract numbers N00178-04-C-3041 and N00178-04-C-3004 respectively, on 12 December 2003.</p>
<p>Topic N02-133 sought the development of controls for electromagnetic systems that could accurately and reliably estimate the state of the machine without feedback from mechanical sensors. During Phase I, ESL conducted a study to assess the feasibility of advanced control techniques, such as Back-ElectroMotive Force, high frequency induction, and advanced state estimators. During Phase II, ESL developed prototype hardware and software necessary to demonstrate the control system on a linear motor system at NAWC-AD Lakehurst. The Phase I &amp; II efforts developed a control scheme, including hardware and algorithms, which effectively and accurately provided system controls; and proved through analysis, modeling and lab demonstrations that the concepts could meet the stated requirements. ESL was able to successfully demonstrate that such motor control techniques could rival the performance of traditional control techniques.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies/Services.</p>
<p>This Phase III effort derives from the Phase I and II efforts described in paragraph 2 and is for the continued development of a control system architecture and algorithm(s) to be utilized on the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) system's electromagnetic motors and Energy Absorber.</p>
<p>This Phase III effort will develop an AAG control system for integration into the existing AAG hardware and software suite. This control system will be based upon analysis, research, and testing. Specific tasks include the design; analysis; testing; coding; integration; and verification of new control algorithms. The improved control system architecture will interface with the larger AAG Dynamic Control System, which is responsible for communications, fault detection, and user interface functions. ESL will analyze and demonstrate acceptable performance, stability or robustness, and sensitivity of the control system architecture throughout the AAG operating envelope, initial conditions, and fault modes. The control system algorithms will be designed to be insensitive to hardware performance variations. ESL will design the control system to provide robust, reliable, and safe system operation. ESL will verify that the control system meets industry standard margins for man-rated control systems once integrated into the AAG hardware and software suite. The improved control system will be fielded to enable the AAG system to meet its performance requirements across the entire AAG performance envelope. This control system will be installed, tested and qualified on the AAG system at NAWC-AD Lakehurst's test facility. Subsequently, the control system improvements will be installed on the AAG system aboard CVN-78 for fleet operational use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Identification of Statutory Authority.</p>
<p>10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(5), as implemented by FAR 6.302-5: Authorized or Required by Statute.</p>
<p>15 U.S.C. 638(r)(1) states:</p>
<p>"In the case of a small business concern that is awarded a funding agreement for Phase II of an SBIR or STTR program, a Federal agency may enter into a Phase III agreement with that business concern for additional work to be performed during or after the Phase II period. "</p>
<p>Furthermore, 15 U.S.C. 638(r)(4) states:</p>
<p>"To the greatest extent practicable, Federal agencies and Federal prime contractors shall issue Phase III awards relating to technology, including sole source awards, to the SBIR and STTR award recipients that developed the technology."</p>
<p>5. Demonstration that Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of Acquisition Requires Use of Authority Cited.</p>
<p>The nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authority cited. The SBIR/STTR Programs are structured in three phases. Phase I (project feasibility) determines the scientific, technical and commercial merit and feasibility of the ideas submitted. Phase II (project development to prototype) is the major research and development effort, funding the prototyping and demonstration of the most promising Phase I projects. Phase III (commercialization) is the ultimate goal of the SBIR/STTR Programs. Because the Phase III work derives from, extends, or completes efforts performed under Phase I and Phase II, use of the authority cited is required.</p>
<p>6. Description of Efforts Made to Ensure Offerors Were Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as Practicable/ Public Notification through Government Point of Entry (GPE).</p>
<p>The topic for this effort was included in the Department of Defense Program Competitive Solicitation issued under the SBIR Program. As described above, only ESL is being considered for Phase III award due to the nature of the acquisition. In accordance with FAR 5.202(a)(7), this proposed contract action does not require public notification to the GPE.</p>
<p>7. Determination of Fair and Reasonable Cost.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will determine prior to award that the negotiated price of the contract executed under this justification is fair and reasonable pursuant to FAR Subpart 15.4. This determination will be documented in a Business Clearance Memorandum, which will be included in the contract file.</p>
<p>8. Description of Market Research or Statement of the Reason Market Research was not Conducted.</p>
<p>FAR 10.001(a)(2) indicates that market research appropriate to the circumstances must be conducted. SBIR Phase III procurements are such that traditional market research to identify alternative sources is generally unnecessary. As described above, the Phase III work derives from, extends, or completes efforts performed under Phase I and Phase II.</p>
<p>9. Any Other Supporting Facts.</p>
<p>Not applicable.</p>
<p>10. Listing of Interested Sources.</p>
<p>Not applicable.</p>
<p>11. Actions Taken to Remove Barriers to Future Competition.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer anticipates that competitors will enter the market once the product is commercialized. It is likely that future acquisitions will be competed using full and open competition and commercial item acquisition procedures. The Contracting Officer is not aware of any specific actions that would further remove barriers to competition.</p>
<p>12. Period of Performance.</p>
<p>Base: 10 months<br />Options: None</p>
<p>13. Total Estimated Dollar Value of the Acquisition Covered by this J&amp;A, with Funding Specified by Year and Appropriation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14. Actions Attempted to Make Immediate Acquisition Competitive and Cost/Benefit Analysis</p>
<p>No actions were attempted to make the immediate acquisition competitive; no cost/benefit analysis was performed. As described above, only ESL is being considered for Phase III award due to the nature of the acquisition.</p>
