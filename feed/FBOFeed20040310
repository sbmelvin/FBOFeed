<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New Jersey officials, requires a firm fixed-price, requirements contract for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Jersey City and Hoboken areas of the State of New Jersey.  This spring, APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 955 trees with an estimated total diameter at breast height (dbh) of 6,224 via soil injection and an estimated 102 trees with an estimated total potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, Rose of Sharon (dbh equal or greater than 4 inches), European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza, London Plane, and Sycamore.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  A requirements contract will be awarded in the event additional control applications are needed or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUB Zone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAIC Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average receipts.  This agency does not issue hard copies of the solicitation; you must download a copy from this website. The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about the first week in February 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer three weeks thereafter.

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA for its Helicopter Quieting Program.  The objective of the Helicopter Quieting Program Phase 1 is to develop physics-based rotor-blade design tools that are truly predictive.

Total program funding for this BAA is currently estimated at the following amounts:  $1,800,000 for FY04, $3,500,000 for FY05, and $1,700,000 for FY06.  NOTE:  Although this BAA will be open for one (1) year from the date of its publication in FedBizOpps and FedGrants, the government anticipates the majority of funding for this program will be committed during First Selections.  To be considered for funding during First Selections, proposals must be received no later than 4:00PM Arlington, VA Local Time on 30 April 2004.  To preclude unnecessary effort on the part of respondents to this BAA after First Selections, offerors should contact the DARPA Program Manager concerning the likelihood of future funding availability under this BAA.  EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Offerors choosing to respond to this BAA will be evaluated against the following six (6) criteria:  1) Offeror's Understanding of the Problem and Scope of Technical Effort, 2) Relevance to DARPA Mission, 3) Soundness of Offeror's Technical and Management Approach, Including Teaming, 4) Relevant Experience, 5) Schedule, and 6) Cost Realism.

<DESC>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) in Woods Hole, MA has a requirement for supplemental fishery observer services.  The Contractor shall collect scientific, management, regulatory compliance and economic data at sea through interviews of vessels captains and crew, observations of fishing operations, measurements of selected portions of the catch and fishing gear and collection of samples.  Data collected includes data on the vessel, crew, fishing practices and cost of operation.  This data, which cannot be obtained either dockside or while aboard Government research vessels, is necessary for the management of fisheries occurring in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the high seas beyond the EEZ. The work requires deploying certified observers to meet coverage levels prescribed in sea day schedules developed by NMFS/NEFSC.  The Contractor shall support, as specified, the observers during each phase of their employment period, including training, briefing, travel, accomplishing requisite land duties, data collection on fishing vessels, and debriefings. The Contractor shall provide all necessary logistical and administrative support to deploy observers to ports from which fishing vessels depart. This includes making travel arrangements, providing travel advances for observers, reimbursing vessel operators for observer meals, and reimbursing observers for travel expenses. Vessels operate out of ports from New York to Maine in ocean waters, 3-200 miles offshore in all weather conditions. Typically, trips are 1- 5 days in duration. Vessels are generally 30-100 feet in length. Crew members and observers live and sleep in cramped quarters, often in damp conditions and share common facilities.  Because of the size of the vessels, motion sickness can be debilitating for some individuals.  Observers must be willing to travel occasionally to cover locations other than their home ports. This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.  The Government anticipates award of an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type of contract with a period of performance of one year.  The anticipated issue date for the solicitation is March 15, 2004 with a closing date on or about April 2, 2004. All responsible offerors may submit a proposal that will be considered by the agency. Neither telephone requests nor inquiries will be accepted in response to this notice.  All written inquiries must be received not later than ten days prior to closing date of solicitation.  Requests for copies of the solicitation may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  Numbered note 1 applies.

<DESC>The Space Warfare Center intends to pursue a sole-source follow-on effort with Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems (NGES) for Aerospace Fusion Center (AFC) Operations and Maintenance Support.  NGES, 1100 West Hollyvale Street, Azusa, California 91702, is currently performing this effort under the Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) Contract F04701-02-C-0009.  The current AFC contractual coverage ends on 30 Sep 2004 and is being performed on a sole-source basis.  To maintain continuity for a future AFC requirement, an additional basic year of contract support with four one-year options for the continued operations and maintenance support of the AFC system is anticipated.  The requirement consists of seamlessly extending support for AFC, supporting exercises/special events, remote fusion activities, providing operational performance assessment, mission performance improvement, software prototype development, testing, installation and tuning of system algorithms.  This includes operating and maintaining a development facility located at the Joint National Integration Center (JNIC) at Schriever AFB CO that provides data connectivity on a 5-day per week, 8-hour per day schedule with possible variable hours to meet operational and contingency support requirements.  The contractor personnel who operate and maintain the AFC are required to have current TS/SCI security clearances and must be cleared at the appropriate program level clearance.  NGES, as the manufacturer for the DSP sensor and developer of the software, is qualified to continue the development and enhancement of this product in a timely and cost-effective manner.  NGES has access to proprietary engineering information not available in existing Government specifications, drawings and manuals, as well as the telemetry data, communication lines and a Special Compartmentalized Information Facility (SCIF), which are key components for meeting the operational mandates.  The period of performance for the follow-on effort is expected to commence on 01 Oct 2004.  This synopsis is a notice of intent to transfer the AFC effort from the STSS Contract F04701-02-C-0009 to a contractual vehicle administered by 50 CONS in conjunction with the Space Warfare Center and shall not be considered a request for offers.  However, interested parties are invited to submit a statement of technical capabilities not to exceed ten pages that includes the following information:  1) Company name, mailing address, points of contacts and telephone numbers; 2) Business size classification, Large, Small or Other; 3) Experience in operating and maintaining the continual development of Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) Increment One Based (MD-1) software, the Multi-Source Fusion Engine (MSFE) software, and NGES’s MASTER MASINT  (Measurements And Signatures INTelligence) Analysis Software Tools for Enhanced Reporting) and AWARE (Advance Web-Accessible Reporting Environment) proprietary products on the hardware platforms located at the AFC facility; 4) The facilities to work at the appropriate security levels.  Statement of Capabilities are due by COB 26 Mar 04.  The Government will not pay any costs associated with preparation of Statement of Capabilities.  All written responses shall be submitted to 50 CONS/LGCZB, Attn: Robert Wind, 210 Falcon Parkway, Suite 16, Schriever AFB, CO 80912-2116.

Small business participation:  Although this procurement is open to large business, small, small women owned, small disadvantaged, Section 8(a), Service-disabled Veteran, and HUBZone small business firms are strongly encouraged to participate.  The Government recognizes the talent existing in smaller firms and encourages their participation in construction of Federal facilities.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source contract. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price type contract to IndaSea, Inc., for a follow on to a research and development effort entitled "Cultural Simulation Model (CMS)" which allows multiple cultural agents to interact to real time data streams which reflect actions of terrorists and non-terrorists.   The CMS evolved from unique capabilities resident within IndaSea regarding the use of autonomous (software) data handlers, and the creation of a technologically revolutionary logic web that allows the same data to be applied simultaneously to modeling interactions on multiple scales ranging from very small (simulation of multiple competing interests with an individual person) to very large (global State interactions).  The logic webs also have the capability to integrate large amounts of live (incoming) data quickly into the simulation itself, affecting the behavior of the computer agents in real time.  Phase I of the CMS resulted in the development of the computer architectural requirements and a working prototype computer model.   Phase II of the project incorporated new data into the model, integrated methods to acquire subject matter expert data, developed system-scaling requirements, continued development of display method, and demonstrated the model.  Phase II devised methods of distributing cultural elements throughout the CSM structures thereby forming an open system allowing inclusion of data from the multiple perspective of various disciplines.  CSM development effectively balanced technical and contextual needs of threat anticipation with the ease of use and understand of the end user.   Phase III of the CMS will expand the successful prototype, expand software, increase input from subject matter experts, and expand live data feeds.  Phase III will result in a computer simulation model capable of receiving live electronic data, modeling cultural interactions between multiple individuals, and displaying the results of the computations to analysts.  Phase III will provide a CSM capable of calculating interactions with the intent of anticipating threats.  IndaSea is the originator, developer, designer and sole user of the autonomous data handler and logic web tools necessary for the continued development of the CMS.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is conducting a full and open competition to acquire the services of a qualified U.S. Contractor to implement a program to build the capacity of key sectors of indigenous Iraqi civil society and to promote the development of a professional and independent media in Iraq.  A vibrant and politically-active civil society is crucial to the future of a democratic and pluralistic Iraq.  As Iraq transitions to a fully representative democracy, its citizens must be able to exercise their freedom to associate, express their views publicly, openly debate public policy, and petition their government.  Civil society organizations (CSOs) must be willing and able to take on potentially divisive issues such as civic education, women’s rights, government corruption and impunity, and a free, independent, and professional media.

The Contractor will administer a program of training, technical assistance, commodities support, and small grants to national, regional, and local level CSOs and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).       

The Contractor shall be responsible for deploying rapidly to Iraq, providing for its own housing and security and is expected to be fully operational in 30 days.

Any resultant contract must include a minimum goal of 10% for small business subcontracting.

The base period of performance for this contract is 18 months from the date of award with options for additional services.  The estimated dollar value is $40 to $50 million for the base period.

The preferred method of distributing the USAID procurement information will be through Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov).  It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about March 26, 2004.  It is the responsibility of the recipient of this solicitation to ensure that it has been received in its entirety and USAID bears no responsibility for data error(s) resulting from downloading.  All correspondence regarding this notice must be submitted in writing.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command for the PEO Combat Systems Joint Project Office intends to solicit offers for the Gladiator Tactical Unmanned Ground Vehicle (TUGV) System Demonstration and Development (SDD) effort and procure such effort on an other-than-full-and-open, best value basis.  This is a proposed twenty-three (23) month effort to provide 6 systems.  The type of contract anticipated is a cost-plus-incentive-fee, research and development contract.  This effort is limited to Carnegie Melon University, Cage Code 00000 and Lockheed Martin Corporation Missile and Fire Control, Cage Code 64059 because award to any other sources would likely result in substantial duplication of cost and delay to the government that is not expected to be recovered through additional competition.  From a Broad Agency Announcement which received fourteen competitive bids, CMU and Lockheed were awarded and have performed previous contracts for the initial Science & Technology effort for Gladiator.  A DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) for this effort will be posted on the MARCOSYSCOM web site under Business Opportunities.  Questions and comments on the DRAFT RFP are to be provided in writing no later than 22 March 2004 to the Government for review and response.   No telephone requests will be accepted.  You may FAX  (256-842-0230) e-mail (nancy.knight@redstone.army.mil) or mail your questions to PEO Ground Combat Systems Joint Project Office, Bldg 3221, Snooper Road, ATTN:  SFAE-GCS-UGV/ATTN: Ms. Nancy Knight, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898.

This sole-source solicitation is not meant to be used as a vehicle for the Army to procure an upgraded/updated replacement for the current legacy AN/APX Ã¢Â€Â“100 Systems. Replacement of the legacy Transponder Sets is a tri-service o bjective that will be satisfied with the Army acquisition of the new RT-1836( C )/APX-118( C ) Transponder starting Fiscal Year 2004.  The above version C RF Modules and A2 CCAs are sub-assemblies of the RT-16XX(V)/APX-100(V) Transponders.  There is currently no detailed Technical Data for the RT-1471A/APX-100(V) and RF Module sub-assemblies available from the Army.  The government does not possess adequate drawings and other final documentation for the RT-16XX/APX-100(V) Transponders and A2 CCAs.The Transponders shall be warranted to meet the following criteria: Form, fit and functionally interchangeable (down to the module/circuit card assembly), with RaytheonÃ¢Â€Â™s Part Numbers. Meet requirements for DOD AIMS 97-1000 (DoD International AIM S Program Performance Standard, para. 4.1), DoD AIMS Program Office Ã¢Â€Âœapproval is required prior to procuring COTS/NDI to be used as replacement for an interface with existing AIMS systems. CECOM will not want to spend the time and money to AIMS qualif y new Transponder sets or incur any  additional cost due to new/additional provisioning, logistics and maintenance support for a different AN/APX-100 configuration. Production Lead Time of 6-9 months is required for Transponders and 6 months for RF Modules . Meet the requirements of MIL-R-81876B The RF Modules and A2 CCAs shall be warranted  to be form, fit a functionally interchangeable with RaytheonÃ¢Â€Â™s Part Numbers. When the RF modules and A2 CCAs are assembled in the RT-16XX(V)/APX-100(V) Transponders, the Transponders shall meet all the ab ove Transponder criteria. The current commercial source for Transponders, RF Modules and A2CCAs that meet all the above criteria is Raytheon Systems Company.  Detailed Technical Data and updated/current drawings are not available from the Army. In addition  this market survey is to locate additional commercial sources for Depot Repair Support Services for the AN/APX-100 Transponder System.  This will be an effort involving total and complete organic repair down to the piece part level and the contractor will  have to overcome problems relating to repair parts obsolescence when problems of this nature arise. This effort shall also include procurement of repair material and retrofitting of RT-12XX/APX-100(V) and RT-15XX/APX-100(V) units into RT-16XX/APX-100(V) u nits to incorporate Modification Work Order (MWO) 11-5895-1037-30-2.

These FTSS services include Contractor Operation and Maintenance Services (COMS), Contractor Instruction (CI), training device relocations, technical data verification, modifications to training devices and equipment, student management, and other support (e.g., access control, janitorial service, In-Service Engineering Office (ISEO) support, instructional systems development, spare and repair parts provisioning, etc.).  An Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity Contract (ID/IQC) with multiple awards is anticipated.  

The current ceiling estimate of the acquisition is $800,000,000 inclusive of all contracts awarded, and all subsequent task orders issued during the five-year ordering period.  The acquisition base will include aviation, surface, and sub-surface FTSS service efforts handled by the Navy and Marine Corps.  Awardees will be required to provide the entire range of FTSS services described above.  To conserve bid and proposal costs, the awardees will be allowed to “no bid” on subsequent task orders solicitations.  

Presently, FTSS services are being provided primarily under numerous five-year task orders awarded under the existing FTSS multiple award, ID/IQC; the ordering period of which ends in March 2005.  It is anticipated that future FTSS requirements and follow-on acquisitions to current FTSS service efforts, will be afforded the opportunity to come under the subject FTSS II contracting vehicle.  This will be a competitive, negotiated acquisition with a contract award based upon the best value “trade-off analysis” evaluation criteria stipulated in Section M of the forth coming Request for Proposal (RFP).  Selection of offers for award will be based on the evaluation of written proposals.

Each offeror will be required to provide detailed information on its technical and management capabilities to include past performance and pricing information.  A sample task will be utilized to assess portions of the offerors’ technical and management capability.  The government reserves the right to award without discussions.  A draft version of the Statement of Work and portions of the Request for Proposal will be released on the World Wide Web at http://www.fedbizopps.gov and posted to the NAVAIR Orlando business opportunities bulletin board at www.ntsc.navy.mil on or about 9 April 2004.  

A partial small business or “small business team” set-aside is planned for this procurement with an anticipated minimum of two small business awardees.  The small business team must all be small under the size standard for the procurement in accordance with 13 CFR 121.103(f). A large business cannot be a member of a small business team, however nothing prevents the team from subcontracting to a large business as long as the team performs enough of the work to meet subcontracting limitations in accordance with FAR 52.219-14.

A pre-solicitation conference is anticipated to be held at NAVAIR, Orlando, FL during the last week of April 2004.  A pre-proposal conference/site survey is anticipated during June 2004.  The RFP closing date is anticipated to be in late July 2004.  Specific dates, times, and places will be provided in future Fedbizopps announcements and posted in updates to the NAVAIR Orlando business opportunities bulletin board.  Contract award is scheduled for January 2005.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330, and the small business size standard is $23 million.

<DESC>Wilderness Trip Planning Modules for the World Wide Web - Development and Maintenance.
The Sierra Nevada Wilderness Education Project and Sequoia and Inyo National Forest are participating in a web-based trip-planning module project, which will allow users interested in visiting Sierra Wilderness areas to gain more information and more adequately plan their excursion before leaving home.  The modules consist of interactive web-based maps that allow users to link to detailed information about the Wilderness area and its characteristics, including access, restriction and trailhead information.  We are hoping to establish a 5-year maintenance and development contract.

<DESC>1) Overview

The United States Postal Service’s Package Services group intends to implement a turn-key solution for expedited packaging supplies fulfillment that reduces costs, increases efficiencies and improves the overall customer ordering experience with regard to supplies.  A vendor will be selected to warehouse packaging supplies inventory, interface with a USPS customer care center to accept orders and communicate order status, act as a liaison on behalf of the Postal Service with various manufacturers of packaging supplies for direct-vendor delivery, and ship orders from its own facilities.  The selected vendor will be further required to maintain order information, and produce summary reports to facilitate product assortment and operational decisions. 

‘Expedited packaging supplies’ refers to those items offered to customers at no additional charge for use with premier USPS services—Express Mail, Priority Mail, and global delivery services.  The Postal Service offers customers a series of unique packaging solutions ranging from corrugated boxes and envelopes, to a range of pressure sensitive tape, labels, and decals.  Currently, the Postal Service offers customers a total of 68 different packaging-related items.  On average, approximately 162,000 supplies orders, which contain 3.82 items per order, are fulfilled each month.  Of these, approximately 29,000 are orders for one of five different custom-imaged labels.  These items are offered to further enhance customer convenience, and are imaged with 7 to 20 lines of variable text.  The average label order contained 249 labels.

The expedited packaging supplies program is a significant source of customer value and affects customer perception toward the premier offerings of the Postal Service.  Customers place orders for supplies via multiple channels, and this important experience—from order placement through receipt of the supplies order—affects the customer’s perception toward the use of the services themselves.  The supplies fulfillment process, depending on the speed and accuracy with which it is administered, can serve to enhance, or detract from, customer retention.  The fulfillment center is an important part of this dynamic.

Though an important selling tool, the supplies program also carries considerable costs to administer.  For this reason, customer value must be balanced against the cost to the Postal Service of achieving it.  The solution planned seeks to achieve this balance, minimizing costs, while maintaining solid customer support.  To this end, Package Services seeks to pre-qualify suppliers who demonstrate extensive experience in the fulfillment industry, with world-class operations, comprehensive information systems, and a commitment to quality.  A comprehensive competitive solicitation will allow for overall reconfiguration, and afford opportunity for one or more strategic partnerships.   

2)  Required Supplier Criteria and Other Information

The USPS intends to pre-qualify respondents capable of providing an innovative and commercially available fulfillment services. Respondents included in any subsequent pre-qualified group may be invited to participate in follow-up pre-qualification processes, a discovery process or to provide proposals in response to the USPS Request for Proposal.  However, the USPS reserves the right to terminate this process if it is deemed that the availability or maturity of the commercial solutions does not fit the current need or vision of the USPS.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USPS activities.

3)  Selection Process

The USPS decision to pre-qualify respondents is a business decision of the USPS Purchasing team.  Pre-qualification does not constitute an award.  Pre-qualification will be based on a composite of all responses, not any single item, that demonstrate a respondent’s capability to provide an innovative and commercially available fulfillment services.  All qualified respondents may not be placed in the pre-qualified group if the purchase team determines that a smaller group may provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for others less qualified.  Respondents whose responses to this notice indicate that their solution is (1) not commercially available, (2) beyond the current or immediate experience level or resources of their firm, or (3) deemed unrealistically incompatible with the USPS environment and vision, may not be considered for pre-qualification.

4)  Notification to Selected Suppliers

The contracting officer will notify all respondents of their pre-qualification status.  The list of pre-qualified candidates will be publicized.

<DESC>We are currently soliciting for an  Indefinite Quantity Corporate Contract to replace SP070099D9713 (O’Gara-Hess), expiring 4-6-04.  The solicitation was delayed due to incomplete data.
Issuance occurred on 11-17-03 with closing projected 01-23-04.  Estimated award date for the new contract is beginning of fourth quarter FY04; therefore, we are extending the current contract, SP070099D9713 for six-months due to the urgency of requirements, in accordance with FAR 6.302-2.  The estimated volume/value for the extension is 7257 orders and $2,853,655.24 based on the past six month history for the ----9713 contract.  Expiration of this contract before the successor is in place would cause a disruption in work processes; i.e., generating hundreds of PRs for Non-NSN (CAGE and P/N) and Non stocked NSNs to DSCC buyers that are currently handled by the O’Gara-Hess Corporate Contract.  The supplies are urgently required to maintain continuity of supplies during wartime and the using services’ military capability will be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to extend the existing contract by six months.  The requisitions going to this contract consist of IPG categories, with many IPG Is, and special 9XX project codes.

Contracting Office Address
Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), 8725 John J. Kingman Road, Room 3830, Fort Belvoir, Virginia 22060-6222

Description

DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the electric, propane gas, water distribution system and the wastewater collection system at Fort Hunter-Liggett, California.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Offers will not be required to submit offers on all of the utility systems and may submit offers on individual system(s) or on groups of systems on an all or none basis.  For purposes of economic comparison required by 10 U.S.C. 2688, each system will be analyzed and considered for award separately. 
The Utility Systems being privatized are described as follows:
Installation: Fort Hunter-Liggett
Location: Fort Hunter-Liggett, California is located situated approximately 250 miles north of Los Angeles and 150 miles south of San Francisco in California’s Central Coast region.

Installation Description:  Fort Hunter Liggett is occupying over 165,000 acres in the San Antonio River valley next to the Los Padres National Forest.  The installation’s population today is 250 permanent residents and civil servants, with increases up to 4,000 transient active duty personnel when on training rotation.  Housing occupancy is typically 98 percent.

Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope, and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

A.   Electrical Distribution System Description
The Fort Hunter Liggett electrical distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the points at which the electricity enters the system and/or where the Government ownership currently starts, to the point of demarcation.
Primary power enters the installation at 12 kV from Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E).  There are 21 separate meters servicing cantonment, housing, Ammunition Supply Point, MPRC, Williams Hill, Bald Mountain, 8J, Site Alpha, and Site Bravo repeater station areas.  There are no substations on the installation, but the MPRC system has a switching station.  Average monthly consumption is approximately 830,000 kilowatt hours with usage peaking in late summer to early fall.  Emergency generators will remain under the ownership of the installation.  All overhead (pole-mounted) transformers have had all polychlorinated biphenyls  (PCB’s) removed.  All pad-mounted transformers except two have had PCB’s removed.

B.	Propane System description:

The Fort Hunter Liggett propane system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the points at which the propane enters the system and/or where the Government ownership currently starts, to the point of demarcation.  The system may include, but is not limited to above ground storage tanks, valves, regulators, meters and distribution lines including service lines.
The propane system at Fort Hunter Liggett is concentrated within the cantonment area and   consists of approximately 5,000 feet of distribution piping ranging from 1 to 2 inches in diameter.  Within the system are 26 above ground storage tanks ranging in capacity from 287 to 18,000 gallons.  The propane system components vary in age, with the newest tanks installed in 1993.  The commodity provider, Northern Energy, also has approximately 46 propane tanks on post, of which they will retain ownership and control.  Propane is used mostly for heating and cooking.  Tanks are on a maintenance plan with the Directorate of Public Works to be painted every 5 years.  Propane systems are currently in code compliance.  Average consumption is 26,000 gallons of propane per month, with usage peaking in winter.

C. Water Distribution System: 

The Fort Hunter Liggett water distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the system from the points at which the water enters the system and/or where the Government ownership currently starts, to the point of demarcation.  The system may include, but is not limited to wells, storage tanks, distribution piping and appurtenances.
There are no groundwater withdrawal permits.  Fort Hunter Liggett operates the supply system under California Department of Health Services Water Supply Permit No. 02-90-003, amended May 17, 2000 for corrosion control.  The Offeror shall comply with all sampling and testing requirements of the California Department of Health Services, Drinking Water Field Operations Branch, per Water Quality Monitoring Summary, (for a “Community Small Groundwater Developed” (CSGD)), for the Monitoring Period of January 2002-December 2004.

The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the water systems.

D.  Wastewater Collection system:

The system may include, but is not limited to treatment facilities, collection piping and appurtenances.  

The wastewater system at Fort Hunter Liggett is concentrated mostly in the cantonment area and consists of collection piping, appurtenances, a treatment facility, and spray fields.  The original system was constructed in the 1950’s, and improvements have been made as needed since that time.  All wastewater, primarily domestic sewage and limited vehicle wash water, produced in the cantonment area is treated at the Fort’s 1.0 million gallon per day (mgd) wastewater treatment facility.  Average annual flow to the treatment facility is approximately 88,000 gallons per day (gpd).  Wastewater is treated in concrete-lined aerated lagoons.  The treatment train includes bar screens, a comminutor, a wetwell, and three uncovered aerated lagoons in series.  There are three wetwell pumps in the influent pump station that pump wastewater from the wetwell to a diversion box (valve chamber) that is normally set to divert wastewater to Pond #1, the first and primary aerated lagoon of the three in series.  Two of these pumps make up the primary and secondary pumps, but there is an additional pump for emergency backup.  This pump, in addition to having an electric motor like the other two, has a propane-driven motor so that the pump can still operate during a power outage.  These pumps are automatically controlled by the level of wastewater in the wetwell.
According to California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Coast Region, Standard Provisions and Reporting Requirements for Waste Discharge Requirements, January 1984, C. General Reporting Requirements, “Transfer of control or ownership of a waste discharge facility must be preceded by a notice to the Regional Board at least 30 days in advance of the proposed transfer date.  The notice must include a written agreement between the existing discharger and proposed discharger containing specific date for transfer of responsibility, coverage, and liability between them.  Whether an order may be transferred without modification and a public hearing is at the discretion of the Board.  If order modification is necessary, transfer may be delayed 120 days after the Regional Boards receipt of a complete Report of Waste Discharge.”

The Contractor(s) shall furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe and reliable condition.  The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Real Estate Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  The cascading preference source selection method will be used in the evaluation of firms for award under this solicitation.  Offerors from small businesses will be considered first.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, any award resulting from the solicitation will be made to an eligible small business concern provided that (1) at least two competitive offers are received from responsible small business concerns, and (2) award will be made at a fair market price.  If conditions for an award to a small business are not met, award will be made on the basis of full and open competition considering all offers submitted by responsible business concerns.  Interested sources shall contact Douglas Smith at 703-767-9409 to be added to our bidder mailing list.  
A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance, on the Internet at the below listed URL.  The solicitation will be available on or after March 24, 2004.

All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered.

The subject requirement is for acquisition of 35 NSNs with various item descriptions and end items. This proposed procurement includes a family group of items within the Federal Supply Classes 2520, 2530, 2540, 2805, 2910, 2920, 2940, 2990, 3020, 4030, 4310, 4320, 4330, 4720, 4730, 4820, and 4910. The requirement will result in an award of an Indefinite Delivery Type Contract for which Delivery Orders may be placed for one (1) year. The proposed procurement contains an option to extend the contract period one or more times at the discretion of the government.  The total duration (base plus option years) shall not exceed 5 years. See Note(s): 9, 12, 26. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 01 April 2004. The Small Business size standard is 500 employees. Drawings/specifications will be available through the DIBBS or SRweb solicitation link in the synopsis on the solicitation issue date as applicable. This acquisition is also for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. This is an unrestricted procurement with other than full and open competition.

The proposal shall demonstrate compliance with the following minimum technical factors  for  further consideration of award:  1) all sites and personnel used for processing calls must be within the continental United States; 2) the call center site(s) must be removed from New Orleans to be considered acceptable disaster recovery alternatives; 3) the contractor must have prior experience in operating similar call center programs in the financial services industry, and the contractor must provide a dedicated customer service unit with staff working solely on the contract with the Federal retirement thrift Investment Board.  Proposals meeting the above minimum requirements will be evaluated on the following technical criteria:  1) People Management; 2) Process Management; 3) Technology Management; and Account Management Capability.  Experience in the first three criteria is more important.  An estimated monthly volume of total traffic is over 200,000, with an estimated monthly volume to contractor of from 20-40%, although contractor must be capable of handling the total volume in emergency situations.   The contractor must include the following in the cost proposal:  1)Identification of  the schedule of fees as related to the services to be provided—listing all costs (start up and ongoing) associated with the services and an explanation for their basis; 2) a table listing your best estimated of overall costs by month for the first year of the contract; and 3) indicate if any of above prices including long  distant telephone calls, travel and related charges that may be incurred during the project.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ), in conjunction with New Jersey officials, requires a firm fixed-price, requirements contract for the application of a systemic insecticide (Imidacloprid) for control of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplphora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in the Jersey City and Hoboken areas of the State of New Jersey.  This spring, APHIS anticipates treating an estimated 955 trees with an estimated total diameter at breast height (dbh) of 6,224 via soil injection and an estimated 102 trees with an estimated total potential for damage from this major pest of trees.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, Rose of Sharon (dbh equal or greater than 4 inches), European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Albizza, London Plane, and Sycamore.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Control treatments must be completed prior to adult emergence and flight which begins in late spring and early summer.  Therefore, all projected control treatments must be applied by mid August of 2004.  A requirements contract will be awarded in the event additional control applications are needed or PPQ decides to apply control treatments in the fall of 2004.  The effective period of the contract is anticipated from mid March 2004, through September 30, 2004, with unilateral four options to extend the effective period.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUB Zone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAIC Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $5.0 million dollar average receipts.  This agency does not issue hard copies of the solicitation; you must download a copy from this website. The solicitation is expected to be issued on or about the first week in February 2004, with proposals due to the Contracting Officer three weeks thereafter.

The contract will be a five-year base with five two-year ceiling priced options. and others yet unidentified  The term of the OMNIBUS is valid for five (5) years.  The goal This contract will result from streamlined PBL processing between the Navy and Raytheon that would leverage heavily on standardization of terms and conditions for all systems to reduce administrative lead-time/cycle time, process variation(s) and cost.  .  RAYTHEON shall function as the Government’s Commercial Stock Point for these spares including the perform ance of all routine inventory management functions including receiving, shipping, tracking, warehousing, reporting and scheduling in addition to performance of other ILS elements as required.. Following evaluation and award of this OMNIBUS contract,Raytheon weapon systems may be awarded as ‘tailored’, individual delivery orders to the PBL OMNIBUS contract,will be executed for the specific tasks required for the weapon system from the menu of logistic elements.   called ‘plug-ins’, as the need for PBL coverage emerges.  The Contracting Officer shall send Raytheon all applicable data for each stock number to be covered under the PBL as well as the weapon system (s) applicable performance requirements chosen from available menus of options in the Statement of Work for pricing.  For a weapon system to be awarded as a ‘plug-in’ delivery order against this ‘OMNIBUS’ Raytheon’s final  proposal must demonstrate a savings compared to Navy support costs as determined by an independent cost benefit analysis.  The orders shall cite the specific requirements for Raytheon to manufacture or provide spare/repair parts and various integrated logistics support (ILS) elements, if applicable, in a PBL environment. Contractor proposed pricing may be either on a fixed priced or cost type basis depending on the system maturity and stage of development. The preferred ‘standard’ period of performance for processed delivery orders is a five year base with five two-year, estimated, ceiling priced options  for a potential total of fifteen years.  The period of performance may vary per system depending on the length of intended Navy support/phase out.  Besides Navy, other potential customers for individual systems may include Coast Guard, US Marines, Foreign Military Sales (FMS)  customers with or without cooperative logistic supply support agreements (CLSSAs). It is anticipated that the first ‘plug-in’delivery orders will include the specific PBL requirements of the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) Program, Block 1, (AN/USG-2 and AN/USG-3 (airborne version), the AEGIS combat weapon system and the combined Phalanx/Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM)/SEARAM systems.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541511   NAICS CODE: 541511 THE STATEMENT OF WORK HAS BEEN AMENDED.  THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6 AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION.  QUOTES ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The associated North Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541511 and the business size standard is $21.0 million.  Full and open competitive procedures will be unutilized.  A firm,  fixed price purchase order using Simplified Acquisition Procedures is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for ME Receptor Model Development. STATEMENT OF WORK: BACKGROUND The Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor model is a multivariate receptor  model that uses both measured concentrations and uncertainty estimates to generate both particulate matter (PM) source profiles and source contribution estimates. The PMF receptor model uses a least squares approach to perform the factor analysis and incorporates non-negativity constraints  (Paatero, 1997).  The PMF receptor model is implemented as either PMF2 or PMF3 based on the structure of the data with PMF2 used for a single sampling site, and PMF3 used for multiple sampling sites.  The Multilinear Engine (ME) receptor model was also developed by Paatero (1999), which uses a more  flexible algorithm and a script language similar to Fortran or C.  PMF can be implemented through ME, and ME allows for the incorporation of source profile constraints and the use of supplementary variables such as weekday/weekend and wind direction (Paatero, 2002).  The ability to incorporate  additional supplementary information and the flexibility of the ME program has allowed it to be used for the evaluation of both ambient and personal exposure data (Hopke et al., 2003).  ME is currently available as an executable from Pentti Paatero at the University of Helsinki for a lifetime  single user fee.  The ME model currently does not calculate uncertainty estimates for the source profiles, source contributions, or the supplementary variables.  The lack of uncertainty estimates limits the use of this powerful model for receptor modeling by State and Local Air Pollution Agencies  to support State Implementation Plans for Particulate Matter. SCOPE The contractor shall develop a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) for the ME model development.  The contractor shall provide a stand-alone executable of PMF2 implemented through the ME receptor modeling program described in  Paatero et al. 1999, which can be distributed by EPA at no charge to the user.  This version of the program will be registered to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  The executable will allow transfer of sampling concentration, sample uncertainty, and supplementary data (for examples wind  speed, season or weekend/weekday) to the program and will output model diagnostics, source profiles, sample source contribution estimates, and factor coefficients.  In addition, the contractor shall develop algorithms to estimate the uncertainty of the source profiles, sample source contribution  estimates, and factor coefficients.  The contractor shall prepare a document that describes the method used to calculate the uncertainties.  The contractor shall add the uncertainty algorithm to the executable. TASKS TO BE COMPLETED Task 1.  Provide a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) for the  ME model development The contractor shall provide to the EPA a report describing the ME model development quality assurance procedures (see Guidance for Quality Assurance Project Plans for Modeling EPA QA/G-5M, EPA/240/R-02/007, Dec 2002; http://www.epa.gov/quality/qs-docs/g5m-final.pdf):	a)  describe and provide references for theories/techniques/methodologies that will be used. b) assess whether available algorithms, and other information to be used in Tasks 2 - 4 are adequate and sufficiently complete to develop the pre- and post processing diagnostics and algorithms, ME executable,  and ME uncertainty estimates. c) define the criteria for assessing the quality and reliability of the algorithms and of the model that is being developed and applied (availability and results of quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) data, etc.);	d) report the results from the information  quality and reliability assessments, and; e) assess and ensure that the model, and model results are accurate and complete, including a QA evaluation of the process and products.  Task 2: ME ExecutableThe contractor shall develop a stand-alone version of PMF2 implemented through the ME model  described by Paatero (1999).  The contractor shall provide an executable that can input and output selected variables.  The input variables shall at least include total mass (i.e. PM2.5), species concentrations, species uncertainties, three supplementary variables or factors (for examples   weekday/weekend, season, wind direction), and other required model parameters such as the matrix dimensions, number of factors, robust/non-robust, stabilizer, positive/negative outlier distance, and missing data limit.  The option for use of 0, 1, 2, or 3 supplementary variables shall be allowed by  the executable.  Output variables shall at least include source profile, sample source contributions, factor coefficient estimates, scaled residuals, and model diagnostics (minimally including the number of iterations and Q). Task 3: ME Uncertainty Estimates The contractor shall develop algorithms  to estimate the uncertainty in the source profiles, individual sample source contribution estimates, factor coefficients, and average source contribution estimates.  The contractor shall document the algorithms in a format suitable for submission to Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems  (15 pages).  The contractor shall add the uncertainty algorithms to the Task 2 executable and provide a revised ME executable.  Output variables in the revised ME executable shall at least include source profile and uncertainties, sample source contribution and uncertainties, factor coefficient  estimates and uncertainties, scaled residuals, and model diagnostics (minimally including the number of iterations and Q). DELIVERABLES Task 1.  Provide a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) for the ME model development Provide a QAPP (Microsoft Word format) describing the ME model development  quality assurance procedures.   Deliverable date: 45 days after the start of the performance period. Task 2: ME Executable Provide two ME executables, one for the PMF2 model and a second for the expanded PMF model.  Also provide a report (Microsoft Word format) describing the ME executables  (inputs, outputs, and diagnostics) based on an example data set. Deliverable dates: 6 months after the start of the performance period for the ME executable for the PMF2 model,  12 months after the start of the performance period for the ME xecutable for the expanded PMF model, and 14 months after  the start of the performance period for the report describing both of the  ME executables. Task 3: ME Uncertainty Estimates Provide document (Microsoft Word format) describing uncertainty algorithms.  Add the uncertainty algorithms to the Task 3 executable and provide the executable. Deliverable  date: 18 months after the start of the performance period.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to extend the end date, exclude foreign participation and to republish the original announcement, with administrative corrections and updates, pursuant to FAR 35.016(c).  The administrative corrections and updates are as follows:  (1) update the contracting POC in the body of the announcement and (2) delete the ombudsman program for the announcement.  CONTACT: Contracting Officer, Renee Arcuri, (315) 330-4777, email: Renee.Arcuri@afrl.af.mil. AFRL/IFEC Program Managers and Technical Points of Contact: Mr. Scott F. Adams, (315) 330-1430, email: Scott.Adams@afrl.af.mil; Mr. Richard J. Simard, (315) 330-4104, e-mail: Richard.Simard@afrl.af.mil. Introduction: The Information Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at the Rome Research Site is seeking firms to conduct applied research and advanced technology development in Digital Data Embedding Technologies (DDET): information hiding, steganography, watermarking, steganalysis, embedded data extraction, digital data forensics, etc. Information hiding and data embedding refer to secure addition of information content to digital data products using mathematical techniques which work at the constructive level of the product. Steganography refers to the use of data embedding for covert communication. Watermarking refers to embedding additional information about the cover data. Steganalysis detects the presence of steganographic communications. Embedded data extraction refers to the extrication of hidden information. Digital data forensics refers to analysis that gathers evidence of data composition, origin, pedigree, etc. The primary digital data types of interest include imagery, video and audio. This program will develop, employ and exploit digital data embedding technologies to provide early demonstrations for potential applications to operational DoD systems. It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide a vehicle for continued development over its duration.   Objective:  DDET technologies have shown great potential to contribute to the defense information architecture in the areas of information assurance, authentication, augmentation, and protection. This procurement will assist the government in the technical development of DDET technologies, for evaluation and selection of transitionable technologies, and in prototype demonstrations of these technologies into appropriate systems. These systems could include the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) , the Combined Air Operations Center - Experimental (CAOC-X),    systems at the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) and National Air Intelligence Center (NAIC), and/or others as applicable.

Technical Background: The Air Force Research Laboratory Multi-Sensor Exploitation Branch has fostered DDET research & development for the past several years. For the most part, this has been done with small university grants, small business and dual use contracts, etc. The results have been widely briefed, well-received, and show great potential for providing many new revolutionary information technologies. Selected advances have begun transition to prototypes, to the extent made possible by funding. It is believed that this PRDA will provide the means to effectively enact accelerated future research, development, test, and evaluation, and ultimately result in more rapid DDET technology insertion.    Innovative DDET Research and Development White Paper Solicitation: AFRL/IFE is soliciting White Papers that provide innovative DDET research and development.  Awards:  Multiple awards for the DDET White Paper initiative are anticipated. The principal funding and the anticipated awards as a result of this PRDA will start in 4Q FY02, and will be in the form of contracts, cooperative agreements, or other transactions depending on the nature of the work proposed. Contractor teaming is encouraged. Individual awards will normally range from 6 to 24 months with dollar amounts typically ranging from $25,000 to $1,000,000 for basic research and prototype development, and $500,000 to $2,000,000 for advanced technology development and integration efforts.  AFRL requires innovative, yet demonstrable and usable solutions to meet the needs of this PRDA. Deliverables will be technical reports, prototype applications, software and integrated system enhancements and upgrades.  Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished using the following criteria: (l) overall scientific and technical merit, (2) potential contribution and relevance to this effort, (3) innovativeness of the proposed approach and/or techniques, (4) offerors capabilities and related experience, and (5) cost and fee realism and reasonableness. In addition, the Government will consider other factors such as, past and present performance on recent Government contracts and the capacity to perform the described effort. Experience with, and access to, DDET migration systems will be considered when said migration systems are integral to the proposed work. Criteria 1 through 4 above will also be used to determine whether White Papers submitted are consistent with the intent of this PRDA and of interest to the Government. White paper evaluations will be based on acceptability or unacceptability without regard to other submittals/awards under this PRDA. Options are discouraged and unpriced options will not be considered for award.  No minimum facility clearance, safeguarding capability, or personnel clearances are necessary; however, these could be required based upon the offeror's proposed role and contribution.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME.  Offerors are required to submit an unclassified original plus (3) copies of their White Papers for the DDET PRDA to AFRL/IFEC, ATTN: Scott Adams, Ref. PRDA 02-08-IFKA, 32 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4114. White Papers are limited to a total page count of ten (10) pages and shall be double-spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. A softcopy of the white paper in Microsoft Word must also be provided. White Papers must contain a cover letter indicating whether the offeror is a large, small, woman-owned, small disadvantaged, veteran-owned small, or HUBZone small business, or a Historically Black College or University, or Minority Institution. The White Paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Offerors must mark their White Papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). Multiple White Papers may be submitted in different areas of technology.  It is recommended that White Papers be received early in each Fiscal Year to maximize the possibility of award. However, White Papers will be accepted at any time, but it is more likely that funding will be available during the early portion of each Fiscal Year. The purpose of the White Paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest under this PRDA. Those White Papers found to be consistent with the intent of this PRDA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will receive a subsequent award. White Papers submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  The total value for all awards under this PRDA shall not exceed $24,000,000. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL) will be allowed access to such data.  Foreign allied participation at the prime contractor level is excluded.  The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18.   It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award:  FY02-30 Jun 2002; FY03-30 Jun 2003; FY04-30 Jun 2004: FY05-30 Jun 2005.  White papers will be accepted at any time, but it is less likely that funding will be available in each fiscal year after the dates cited.  This PRDA is open and effective until 30 September 2006.  A copy of the AFRL/IFK publication, "BAA & PRDA: a Guide For Industry", Sep 1996 (Rev), may be accessed at: http://www.if.afrl.af.mil/div/IFK/bp-guide.html.  All responsible firms may submit proposals or White Papers, as appropriate, which shall be considered. Respondents are asked to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number with their submittal(s) and reference PRDA 02-08-IFKA. Only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

The solicitation, when issued, will be a Request for Proposal (RFP).  It is not anticipated at this time that the acquisition will be commercial (FAR Part 12).  A best value source selection will likely be the method of contractor selection.    

The 21st Contracting Squadron at Peterson AFB CO seeks potential sources to perform a variety of non-personal services in support of the mission of the 21st Communications Squadron, Peterson Air Force Base (PAFB), Colorado. These services include support of operations, maintenance and management of the Peterson complex Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) to include unclassified and Multi-level Secure System (MLS) and classified network support, secure dial-in services (e.g., Virtual Private Networking), wireless services, network management, system administration, trouble ticketing (e.g., Remedy ARS), Information Assurance and security, configuration management and control, Internet and Intranet, hardware and software maintenance (to include Defense Messaging System (DMS) and others), help desk services and engineering and technical support to the 21ST Communications Squadron.  Work includes integration and expansion of the Peterson Air Force Base Network  (LAN and WAN) as well as assistance to the Air Force and DoD civilian personnel in the areas of responsibility under the statement of work.  The potential exists for some services to migrate off of this requirement after contract award due to consolidations efforts at the Major Command (MAJCOM) level.  The contractor shall also interface with other contractors or government agencies in support of issues dealing with the evolution of Peterson Complex communications systems in areas where the contractor is the functional manager, i.e., LAN and WAN.  These services shall be performed on a 24-hour-per-day 7-day-per-week basis.  This listing should be considered neither final nor all-inclusive at this time.


The contract performance period will be a base period of one year and four one year option periods, exercised at the unilateral right of the Government.  The proposed contract type will be cost plus award fee or cost plus incentive fee.   The North American Industry Classification Code is 513310.  The small business size standard for this procurement is 1500 employees.  This requirement has historically been and is anticipated to be 100% set aside for small business.

All amendments will be posted to and available for viewing on FBO.   When the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents.  All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award.

Subject to change, a tentative schedule of events follows:  Draft Statement of Work (SOW) and attachments to be posted on or about 15 October 2002; Industry Days and one-on-one discussions may be held on or about 9 and 10 December 2002; Request for Proposal may be released on or about 24 January 2003; Pre-Proposal Conference and site visit may be held on or about 31 January 2003; announcement of contract award on or about 27 August 2003; and transition period beginning on or about 01 September 2003.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, on behalf of the Program Manager for Ammunition, Marine Corps Systems Command and USSOCOM desire the acquisition and qualification of three types of non-developmental 40mm Cartridges to fire from their M203s, M79 and EGLM Launchers.   The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) project (www.acq.osd.mil/sts/fct).  Three different 40mm LV cartridges are desired:  (1) a Tactical Marking Cartridge, (2) a Low Cost (Short Range) Day/Night Training Cartridge and (3) an Extended Range 40mm Day/Night Training Cartridge.    (1) Tactical Marking Cartridge:  A 40mm Infrared (IR) Luminescent Marker capable of being fired from the M203.  The cartridge should have excellent accuracy and low dispersion characteristics capable of hitting vehicle size targets at 200 meters.   The marker must mark a target with material that emits light in the IR spectrum and not in the visual spectrum in close proximity to friendly forces without obscuring soldier night vision devices.  It is desired that the marking material will emit light in a spectrum that is only visible with GEN III night vision devices.   The cartridge should also provide for good shelf life characteristics and functio n after water submersion (see MIL-STD-810E).    (2) 40mm (Short Range) Low Cost Day/Night Training Cartridge:  An improved Low Cost Training (M781) Cartridge that provides for a Day and Night Marking Capability.  This cartridge should retain the low cost characteristics of the current M781 design while providing marking of targets under Day and Night conditions.   The cartridge should not use pyrotechnics that might cause range fires or create inadvertent UXO hazards.   (3) 40mm Day/Night (Extended Range) Training Cartridge:  An improved LV40mm training cartridge that provides for a day and night marking signature better accuracy (lower dispersion) allowing for training at longer ranges.   The cartridge should not use pyrotechnics that might cause range fires or create inadvertent UXO hazards.  The cartridge should provide accuracy / lower dispersion consistent with those of t he improved LV HEDP cartridge (see Sources Sought Notice N00178-04-Q-1009 dated 11 February 2004).   (4) Facilities, Expertise and Safety:    These cartridges should meet stringent Navy WSESRB requirements/standards.  The contractor should have the technical expertise and facilities to conduct standard NATO/IM safety testing prior to delivery of qualification samples. All the cartridges should provide for reduced reaction from outside stimuli (IM characteristics) and provide for good performance after undergoing storage in various environments. Responses must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units.  This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for  Bid or Request for Proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Interested Parties should reply by submitting a White Paper no later than 15 April 2004 to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Attn: Code XDS105, Building 183, First Floor, Room 133, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5100.  Questions may be submitted in writing to the above address, or email XDS11@nswc.navy.navy.mil .Interested Parties who are willing to provide qualified cartridges at no cost for USMC/USSOCOM testing should so indicate in the submitted white paper. No further information is available from the Procuring Office.

<DESC>The purpose of the BCS3 conference is to meet with interested parties wishing to discuss/explore the efforts required to stimulate BCS3 in future federated training exercises in both High Level Architecture (HLA) as well as Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) within Training Exercise and Military Operation (TEMO) domains.  The focus of this conference is primarily technical in nature.  Attendees should be extremely knowledgeable in the areas of simulation architectures and behaviors and be willing to participate in open forum question and answer sessions.   We anticipate that these discussions will produce viable solutions for BCS3 in both HLA and DIS.  

Currently, we are planning to use some form of BCS3 stimulation in a Warfighter or Mission Rehearsal training exercise scheduled for November of 2004.  As such, the BCS3 conference will focus on:  1) Providing a thorough description of the functional and technical aspects of BCS3 (provided by a PM BCS3 representative) in sufficient detail to allow prospective stimulation developers to clearly understand the full range of requirements to stimulate BCS3.  These details will include, at a minimum: input data formats, specifics of the fields in these formats, description of the flow of information, the medium of the flow and other update information and means to view the data as information, 2) Discussing and developing a decision matrix that can be used to determine which stimulation approach best satisfies the requirements, and 4) Discussing and refining future developmental timelines to support initial use at the November exercise. 

To attend the conference, please contact Mr. Ralph L. Poole, Logistics Exercise & Simulation Directorate (LESD) of the National Simulation Center (NSC), at telephone number 804-765-1547 (DSN: 539); or e-mail at ralph.l.poole@lee.army.mil.  Your request and names of representatives must be submitted to Mr. Poole not later than 22, March 2004.  The Conference will be held on 30 March 2004, from 0830 until 1700 hours in Bldg 1109 (the blockhouse) on Fort Lee, Virginia.  Additional information regarding security issues will be provided to you when you contact Mr. Poole.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) issued by the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), Glynco, GA, for the purpose of conducting market research on driver training simulators.   In March 2000, the FLETC issued the original notice seeking information on simulators, but no funds were available to begin the procurement process.  Funding is still not available, but the the FLETC Driver and Marine Division (DMD) wishes to obtain the most current information on these simulators for the purpose of identifying simulations and simulators (part task or full task) that can enhance on-range training in-part or whole, and/or augment the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center's law enforcement driver training.  The information will be viewed with regard to efficacy of positive transfer of training, advanced simulator capabilities, ability to be smoothly integrated into existing programs and any reliable enhancement of the law enforcement driver's performance over time.  The system should also have the capability of producing/recreating computer generated images of all the FLETC's driving ranges in their entirety.  Specific information should be provided concerning the potential of Simulator Adaptation Syndrome (SAS) induced within the FLETC typical student demographic by the product.  Please provide detailed information of any countermeasures that are recommended or required to reduce the degree and frequency of SAS.  Also, please provide the time recommended if an introductory weaning-in protocol is necessary prior to training actually beginning.  The DMD will view the manufacturer's information to determine if an on-site demonstration is desired.  There is no guarantee from the FLETC that manufacturers responding to this notice will receive an on-site demonstration request, but if sufficient information showing a simulator meeting the above minimum requirements is not received in response to this notice, the FLETC will assume that there is no interest in such a demonstration from manufacturers who do not respond.  On-site demonstrations must be furnished at no cost to the Government; there is no guarantee on the Government's part that funds will be made available to the FLETC for a procurement of any simulator.  FUNDS ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT AND THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  Send information to DHS, FLETC, 1131 Chapel Crossing Road, Glynco, GA, 31524, ATTN:  Cynthia D. Bartosh, Procurement Division, Building  93.  Point of Contact is Deborah Wrice, Procurement Technician, Phone (912) 261-3631; Fax (912) 280-5343, Email Deborah.Wrice@dhs,gov.

<DESC>Prototype Tourniquets for The Department of Defense Research On Combat Casualty Care. This is a sources sought, not a request for proposals. The Combat Casualty Care Research Program of the Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) provides int egrated capabilities for far-forward medical care to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with major battlefield wounds and injuries. The USAMRMC is seeking to test and evaluate novel prototype tourniquets for hemorrhage control on the battlefield. In terested firms will be required to execute no cost loan agreements with the USAMRMC to provide 10 prototype tourniquets for test and evaluation at the United States Army Institute of Surgical Research by July 1, 2004. In return, each firm will be provided the test results on their tourniquet. The tourniquet must meet the following requirements: 1) Complete occlusion of arterial blood flow in a thigh (thigh circumference = 26.7 inches); 2) Easy application to either the upper and lower extremity in less than  1 minute (in a tactical environment) with a minimum of familiarization; 3) Must not slip (towards wound) during tightening or following application; 4) Capable of easy release and re-application; 5) Must be less than 230 grams; 6) No external power requir ement, i.e., batteries; and 7) A self-life of 10 yr. Other features that are desirable, but not required are: 1) No less than 2 inches in width; 2) One-handed, self-application to upper extremity; 3) Capability to apply to trapped limbs; 4) Protection from  over-tightening; and 5) Have a predicted cost for large scale production not to exceed $25/unit. No tourniquet equal to or less than 1 inch in width will be considered. Efficacy as well as overall size, weight, and cost will be major considerations. The G overnment has limited resources, so only the most qualified products may be tested. The Government is under no obligation to issue loan agreements for products that do not meet the stated requirements. A letter of intent expressing your interest and provid ing a detailed description of the product to be offered must be e-mailed to Cheryl Miles at cheryl.miles@amedd.army.mil not later than April 15,2004.

<SUBJECT>A -- Identification, Characterization and Development of Inhibitors That Act on Proteins Involved in Modulating Pro-oncogenic Processes.
<DESC>Summary:  The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is currently seeking a Collaborator for a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to work with investigators in the Center for Cancer Research (CCR), the Medical Oncology Clinical Research Unit (MOCRU), to select protein binding sites on targets involved in modulating pro-oncogenic processes, discover novel small molecules to meet these binding site requirements, then synthesize and test these small molecule inhibitors for their efficacy in modulating pro-oncogenic processes. 

Proposed CRADA Collaborator Contribution: The Collaborator will use its proteomics and bio- and chemiinformatics capabilities to assess and analyze mutually agreed upon crystal structures of target proteins.  The Collaborator will generate a drug design report and provide conceptual, representative structures of small molecule inhibitors that are recommended for synthesis.  Upon synthesis and confirmation of activity of members of a novel series by NCI (or Collaborator), Collaborator may undertake co-crystallization of compounds and further apply proteomics and bio- and chemiinformatics for lead optimization.  The Collaborator’s contribution may include submission of an IND to the FDA.  

Proposed NCI Contribution:  The NCI (or Collaborator) may synthesize and NCI will test mutually agreed upon compounds and identify leads with suitable biological activity and acceptable ADME properties.  NCI will conduct necessary preclinical and clinical studies to advance optimized molecules to IND status, and perform appropriate clinical trials required for product registration.  NCI’s contribution may include submission of the IND to the FDA.

Proposed Joint Contribution:  NCI and the Collaborator will jointly design a CRADA research plan, will jointly interpret the data generated, and mutually agree on which compounds should enter clinical trials. 

Selection Criteria for Choosing the CRADA Collaborator May Include:

1.	A demonstrated background and expertise in proteomics and bio- and chemiinformatics.

2.	A demonstrated record of success in the commercial development and production of products related to this area of technology (for example, development of protein-based small molecule inhibitors).

3.	The demonstration of adequate resources to perform the proteomics, small molecule design studies, and to perform the research and development (including crystallographic studies) necessary for commercialization of the resulting inventions.

4.	The willingness to commit best effort and demonstrated resources to the research and development of targets for multiple carcinomas.

5.	The level of financial and staffing support necessary for CRADA-related activities.

6.	The willingness to cooperate with the NCI in the timely publication of research results.

7.	The agreement to be bound by the appropriate Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regulations relating to human subject research and to all Public Health Service (PHS) policies relating to the use and care of laboratory animals.

8.	The willingness to accept the legal provisions and language of the CRADA.  These provisions govern the distribution of future patent rights to CRADA inventions.  Generally, the rights of ownership are retained by the organization that is the employer of the inventor with (1) the grant of a license for research and other Government purposes to the Government when the CRADA Collaborator’s employee is the sole inventor, or (2) the grant of an option to elect an exclusive or nonexclusive license to the CRADA Collaborator when the Government employee is the sole inventor.


Response Procedure:  Interested parties should notify the Technology Transfer Branch of the NCI in writing of their interest in the CRADA collaboration no later than April 30, 2004.  The written notice should briefly address the selection criteria listed above.

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
(i) Relative Capability to meet the Government requirement.
The Government will evaluate each offeror's relative capability on the basis of the breadth, depth, and relevance of experience to the work that will be required under the prospective contract. The Government prefers experience in:  
1.	Department of Navy Staffing and Recruitment Processes to include STAIRS
2.	Staffing services with an emphasis on hard to fill positions requiring unique professional and engineering skills
3.	Knowledge of the Department of Defense Modern Personnel Processing System 
4.	Position Management and Organizational Development assisting with the design of individual position descriptions 
5.	Delegated Examing Authority 
6.	Detailed resumes (limited to three (3) pages per person) are required for each key person who will perform the contract.  Resumes will be submitted in the Contractor’s own format.  
(ii) Past Performance.
The Government will evaluate the offeror’s past performance on similar efforts.  Contractor shall provide all information necessary for the Government to contact previous customers including POC’s name, phone number, email, Government contract number if applicable, dates of performance, and synopsis of work performed  Offerors without past performance information will be evaluated with a neutral rating..
(iii) Price.
The Government will make comparisons among the offerors and will select the offer, which represents the best value to the Government. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest price offeror.

The non-cost evaluation factors (Relative Capability and Past Performance) are significantly more important than price.  However, in making the Government’s best value decision, the importance of price as a factor will increase with the degree of equality in the non-cost factors of offeror’s solicitation responses.  

The Government intends to evaluate offers and a contract WITHOUT discussions with offerors.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  Therefore, each initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint
Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items and DFARS 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items with their offer.  This announcement will close at 4:00 PM EST time on 19 March 2004. Point of Contact is Jenny Rieck who can be reached at email Contracts@aaav.usmc.mil.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) set forth in FAR Part 13. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for Cutting and Joining of 20’ Diameter Microwave Reflectors INTRODUCTION:  NASA requires large microwave collecting area on earth to receive data from spacecraft at large distances.  A cost effective approach to this need utilizes large arrays (&gt;100) of small (40’ diameter) antennas which are produced in a factory.  One approach for factory production of these antennas is a one-piece aluminum stamping technique known as hydroforming.   However, transporting a one-piece reflector of this size from factory to site is difficult and very expensive.  Hence, an experimental investigation of the cutting of a hydroformed formed reflector into two halves and then joining of the two halves using a splice plate is desired.  A 20’ reflector will be used for the experiment. SCOPE: The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel and services, and otherwise do all things necessary and incident to the planning, design, execution, measurement, and reporting of the  cutting and joining of a 20’ diameter microwave reflector as described below.	NASA will be responsible for supply of photogrammetric equipment for measuring the antennas.  TASK DESCRIPTION:	The Contractor shall complete the following: 1) Fabricate a one-piece, hydroformed 20’ diameter, aluminum, parabolic reflector with an Root Means Square (RMS) surface accuracy of  .015” or better. Measure the surface accuracy of this antenna. 2) Cut the reflector into two halves and measure the shape of the two halves. 3) Design and implement a cutting method and splice plate to join the two halves together. 4)  Join the two halves together and re-measure the shape DELIVERABLES 1) Test reports on the shapes of the uncut antenna, two separated halves, and rejoined antenna.  The test reports shall include the measured data in a computer file and also presented as a contour plot of the deviation of the surface from the design shape and the RMS average of this deviation for: a) the uncut reflector b) the two cut but un-joined halves, and  c)  the cut and joined reflector. The test report shall include photographs showing how the reflector was supported during measurement for all 3 cases. 2) The cut antenna and splice plate FOB Contractors facility.	NASA will determine destination at a later date and separately pay for shipping costs. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE The Period of Performance for this effort shall be within 3 months of receipt of order. **NOTE TO PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS: OFFEROR MUST INCLUDE ADEQUATE INFORMATION FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THEIR OFFER MEETS THE ABOVE STATEMENT OF WORK** The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 01-20.
