20.  Mandatory Language:
In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice. 21.  Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to buyer Louis Colon, 405-734-8116, louis.colon.2@us.af.mil.

<p>- the title and/or reference number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the company employee who should receive the bid documents</p>

This proposed contract is being solicited on an UNRESTRICTED basis and open to large and small business concerns. The Small Business size standard classification is North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541330, Engineering Services. The Government seeks the most highly qualified firm to perform the required services, based on the demonstrated competence and qualifications, in accordance with the selection criteria.


Evaluation and selection of the most highly qualified firm will be based on the following selection criteria, listed in descending order of importance: 

Criterion (1).   Firms Specialized Relevant Experience (within five (5) years).

Firms specialized recent relevant experience in the preparation of specifications utilizing the Department of Defense SPECSINTACT program, cost estimates utilizing the MII cost estimating system, Functional Analysis and Concept Development (FACD), Request for Proposal (RFP) documentation for Design-Build (DB), Design-Bid-Build (DBB) projects, MILCON Region/FEC Team 1391 project documentation and Engineering Studies, in the NAVFAC Pacific Area of Responsibility (AOR).
 

More favorable consideration may be given for:
(1)	Submission of more variety of specialized recent experience;
(2)	Projects located in Hawaii, Guam, Tinian, Diego Garcia, and Australia;

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:  

SF330, Part 1, Section F.  For the proposed team, provide in Section F a maximum of ten (10) completed recent relevant projects along with description of correlated A-E support services rendered (Department of Defense SPECSINTACT program, cost estimates utilizing the MII cost estimating system, Functional Analysis and Concept Development (FACD), Request for Proposal (RFP) documentation for Design-Build (DB) and Design-Bid-Build (DBB) projects, MILCON Region/FEC Team 1391 project documentation and Engineering Studies).
 Professional design and engineering services of relevant projects submitted must have been completed within five (5) years immediately preceding the date of issuance of this synopsis. Engineering Studies are specifically related to project siting, scoping, costing and/or site investigations resulting in a MILCON 1391 document(s).  Other Engineering Studies will not be evaluated.  Checklists/matrices identifying specialized experience will not be considered.  Only information provided in Section F, Block 24 will be considered.  Block 24 shall clearly discuss the scope of services to demonstrate specialized experience provided in a project If more than 10 projects are submitted for evaluation, the Government will evaluate the first ten projects and disregard any other project information after the first ten projects.
 

Section F, Block 24.  Each project shall include (1) project title; (2) location; (3) year design and engineering services completed; (4) project owner; (5) point-of-contact name, e-mail address, and phone number; (6) contract number or project identification number; (7) contract performance period; (8) contract award amount; (9) estimated construction cost; and (10) description of project and relevance to this solicitation.  A project is defined as either a stand-alone contract or a single task order in an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The Government will not evaluate information provided for an IDIQ contract and will only evaluate individual task order information.
 The five (5) year completion timeline applies to design and engineering services (Section F, Block 22, Professional Services) and does not include Post Construction Award Services (PCAS) services.  

The submission shall include a discussion of who executed the project as pertinent to demonstrating the firms specialized experience.  If a project was performed by a joint venture (JV), and all JV partners are not on the team proposed for this solicitation, the offeror should specifically address the work performed on the project submitted by the proposed JV partner(s).  If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the proposed JV partner(s), the project will be evaluated less favorably.
Likewise, if the proposed JV partner(s) worked as a subcontractor on a project, the offeror should specifically address the work performed by the proposed JV partner(s) on the project submitted.  If a project does not provide requested data, accessible point-of-contact, or valid phone number, that project may be evaluated less favorably. Note: If the A-E firm is a JV, information should be submitted for projects performed by the JV; however, if there are no relevant projects performed by the JV, submit projects performed by the individual partner entities of the JV.  Failure to submit experience for all JV partners will be evaluated less favorably.

A-E subconsultants specialized experience on a Design-Bid-Build project will not be given the same level of consideration as the A-E prime contractors or JV partners.
Specialized experience of an A-E subcontractor to a construction contractor, serving as the Designer-of-Record on a Design-Build project, will be given the same level of consideration as an A-E firm for a DBB project.

Prime contractor-subcontractor/JVs/LLCs/LTDs with a demonstrated history of working together on prior projects will be considered more favorably than those without such history.

NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Philadelphia has sought eligible contractors to furnish effort including labor, material, and facilities as may be required to repair the items as specified within this document /attachment. However, NAVSUP did not receive any responses. Additionally, all requirements were previously reviewed by NAVSUP Small Business Office for concurrence with decision. As a result, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
Government intends to solicit for the repair of:

One or more of the items under this acquisition is subject to the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement, Free Trade Agreements, and/or the remaining balance is subject to the Buy American Act (BAA), which requires delivery of end products of specified countries or as otherwise consistent with the governing statute and implementing regulations The applicable BAA and TAA clauses and certificates will be included in the solicitation and contract.
Other potentially applicable clauses and certificates, for example those governing specialty metals, commercial derivative military articles, and the prohibition against acquiring munitions list items from Communist China military companies, will also be included. No other restrictions (for example, those for clothing, roller bearings, etc.) have been identified as applying to subject components
Orders issued under the Requirements Type Long Term Contract and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition.
Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source, you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS (Philadelphia) Source approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your companys experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.

https://www.navsup.navy.mil/navsup/ourteam/navsupwss/business_opps

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer.
Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement many continue base on Fleet support needs.

<DESC><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION)</strong>
<p><strong>FA8601-19-Q-0004SS.</strong></p>
<p>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/ Operational Contacting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio is seeking capabilities packages of potential sources, including Small Business (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, Women Owned (WOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned (EDWOSB), Veteran-Owned (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned small businesses that are capable of providing a Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction System (Real-Time PCR or qPCR) as defined in the attached Statement of Work.</p>
<p>The Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) is seeking a Firm-Fixed Priced contract. Firms that respond shall specify that their devices meet the specifications provided below and in attachments and provide detailed information to show clear technical compliance. <strong>Please note that the Air Force is anticipating a Brand Name or Equal acquisition in accordance with FAR 52.211-6.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Detailed Specifications are listed in the attachment identified below:</strong></p>
<p>1.	Draft Statement of Work</p>
<p>The requirements in the draft statement of work will be used as technical discriminators. All interested firms shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to provide the requested supply to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. <strong>Please keep responses under two pages. </strong>As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation (Request for Quotation) exists; therefore, do NOT request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code assigned to this acquisition is <strong>334516 (Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing)</strong> with a size standard of 1,000 employees. Firms responding should indicate their size in relation to this size standard, and also indicate socio-economic status (SB, 8(a), VOSB, SDVOSB, WOSB, EDWOSB, and/or HUBZone). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees, or foreign supplies on this effort. Capability responses will be assessed and the data will be used to assist the Government in determining the acquisition strategy, including Small Business Set Aside (SBSA), sole source, or full and open, for any potential subsequent action.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 10.001, market research results will be used to determine whether FAR Part 19 criteria are met for a SBSA or further socio-economic set aside.  Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a SBSA is that small business prime contractors meet the requirements set forth in compliance with FAR 52.219-14, Limitation of Subcontract.  Responses from small businesses, therefore, need to include rationale as to how compliance with FAR 52.219-14 will be achieved.  Also, the rules governing affiliation and ostensible subcontracting apply when determining size, as does the non-manufacturer rule. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES PACKAGE: All interested firms shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly demonstrates their capabilities to provide the required supply. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements as stated in Attachment 1 hereto.</p>
<p>Responses may be submitted electronically to the following email address: eric.filion@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "<strong>FA860119Q0004SS-Real-Time PCR</strong>". If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachments. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, or .xls documents are attached to your email. All other attachments may be deleted.</p>
<p>Responses may also be mailed to:<br />AFLCMC/PZIBB, <br />ATTN: POC- Mr. Eric Filion<br />1940 Allbrook Dr., Rm 109<br />Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-5309</p>
<p><strong>RESPONSES ARE DUE NOT LATER THAN 8 October 2018 BY 4:00 Eastern Time.</strong> Direct all questions concerning this acquisition to Eric Filion at eric.filion@us.af.mil.</p>

<br />The objective of OA is to demonstrate and validate potential solutions for recommendation for fielding options within the next 1-3 years. The proposed start date for testing of production representative testers under this OA is 1 December 2018. Actual fielding decision is beyond the scope, intent, or authority of this RFI or OA. Potential for follow-on procurement is dependent on results of tests and availability of funding. The government is looking for a system that offers the best value to the government, not necessarily the lowest procurement cost. Mission effectiveness and safety are key considerations.<br /><br />Interested parties capable of providing a potential aircraft smart weapons test set that meets or exceeds the above requirements shall provide a statement of capability (SOC) that demonstrates the existing capability to provide, modify, and sustain the system, along with a description of test set capabilities. A rough order of magnitude (ROM) is requested as part of the RFI and will be used as market research. The SOC shall be unclassified and the information submitted should be pertinent to, and identify, the system capability as related to the technical effort requested. A limit of fifty (50) pages is imposed for the responses, which should be received by close of business 22 October 2018. Testing results are expected to determine the most effective system. <br /><br />Please e-mail all information and SOC to the AATC Contracting Officer, Ms. Kathleen Durco at kathleen.h.durco.civ@mail.mil. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to directly pay for any information or responses submitted as the result of this synopsis.</p>

<DESC>OURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT FOR <br />DURABLE ELASTOMERIC MATERIALS
<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) is seeking information from potential sources for durable elastomeric materials to be used on the Landing Craft Air Cushion Vehicle (LCAC). Due to the harsh operating environment of this fully amphibious air cushion vehicle, employed systems utilize highly durable, erosion-resistant, elastomeric coatings.  The purpose of this Sources Sought notice is to determine whether industry can provide improved commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions for elastomeric coatings for the following two applications.</p>
<p>Rubberized flexible fabric:</p>
<p>The LCAC skirt system is composed of flexible, elastomer coated fabric.  It experiences significant wear and abrasion, particularly during overland operation on concrete apron and ramps. This results in increased sustainment costs and time consuming maintenance.  NSWC PCD seeks improved, innovative elastomeric compounds or additives to improve durability of the skirt system.  Below are desired mechanical characteristics to consider when offering a solution.</p>
<p>Coated Fabric Objectives:<br />Resistance to low temperature	No cracking to -30&deg;F per ASTM D2136-66<br />Resistance to flexural fatigue	No cracking to 6 x 105  cycles per ASTM D430-73<br />Resistance to UV radiation	No surface hardening or cracking per ASTM D750<br />Resistance to abrasion	&lt;8% loss per ASTM D5963</p>
<p>Erosion coatings for rigid structures:</p>
<p>Numerous LCAC components and structures are exposed to high velocity flow containing abrasive elements such as water and sand.  Surfaces of these components require durable erosion coatings to prolong component life and decrease operating costs.  NSWC PCD seeks innovative materials and/or processes that can be applied to rigid structures to meet this urgent fleet need.  Examples of surfaces that require protection include steel, aluminum, composites, and advanced polymers.  Below are desired mechanical characteristics to consider when offering a solution.</p>
<p>Rigid Structures Objectives:<br />Resistance to UV radiation	No cracking, embrittlement, or loss of adhesion per ASTM G155<br />Resistance to rain erosion	minimal loss and no cracking per ASTM G73 <br />Resistance to abrasion	&lt;8% loss per ASTM D5963<br />Resistance to sand erosion	minimal loss and no cracking per MIL-STD-3033<br />Adhesion peel strength 	&gt;30 lbf/in</p>
<p>Responses:</p>
<p>Favorable responses will address the following:</p>
<p>1.	Technical literature with complete description and specifications illustrating the ability of the product or technology to meet the above, or similar objectives provided in this announcement<br />2.	Additional relevant documentation (product specifications, data sheets, user manuals, test reports, etc.)<br />3.	Anticipated life-cycle of the product or technology in the intended environment<br />4.	Current readiness of the product or technology and its availability<br />5.	Future development or investment needed to evolve the product or technology to meet the objectives in this announcement</p>
<p>Interested parties must provide electronic submittals to be received by the Government 45 business days from date of announcement.  There is no specific format or outline that submittals must follow. Each response must reference the announcement title and be directed to the appropriate party as provided below.</p>
<p>Submittals concerning flexible fabric coatings should be directed to Technical POC: Ashley Williams at ashley.williams3@navy.mil.</p>
<p>Submittals concerning erosion coatings for rigid structures should be directed to Technical POC: Doug Brown at clyde.d.brown@navy.mil.</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT, A MARKET SURVEY FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY. THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PROCURE ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, NOR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED.</p>

3.  Past Performance on Contracts with Government Agencies (particularly Department of Veterans Affairs) and Private Industry in Terms of Cost Control, Quality of Work, and Compliance with Performance Schedules:  This factor shall be evaluated based on the information provided by the A-E on similar type projects, performance appraisals on file with the Department of Veterans Affairs, any Government sponsored performance rating system and contact with personnel listed in the SF 330 regarding past performance as well board members personal knowledge of the firm.  

4.  Capacity to Accomplish the Work in the Required Time:  This factor evaluates the ability of the A-E firm, given their current projected workload and the availability of their key personnel, to accomplish the projects in the required time.  

5.  Location in General Geographical Area of the Project and Knowledge of the Locality of the Project:  This factor evaluates the distance from the A-E firms design office from the location of work (James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center), and knowledge of the geographic area.

<p>CONTRACT/PROGRAM BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Contract Number/Task Order: HC1047-13-D-4003/0003<br />Contract Type: FFP<br />Incumbent and their size: Unitech Consulting, LLC., Small 8(a)<br />Method of previous acquisition: 8(a) Competitive Set-Aside</p>
<p>Brief description of current effort: The current effort covers five (5) DISA locations that support Tier I (Service Desk) services, while Tier 2 (Desktop Support) services are provided at limited DISA locations. The new requirement will support DISA and the 4th Estate agencies with an approximate user base of 2,100,000 users worldwide and an average of 207,084 interactions per month. To provide additional flexibility and efficiency, the new requirement for Tier I services moves the place of performance to the contractor's U.S. based facility in an active/active configuration with NIPRNet and SIPRNet connectivity at the SECRET level clearance. Tier II services will be required to be performed at the Government facilities but it is required to be extended to support - over 421 Tier 2 locations. These Tier 2 locations span across 50 CONUS and 36 OCONUS locations and carry an average of 90,620 tickets per month. (One state may have multiple locations and/or multiple buildings within close proximity). Since the requirement has materially changed in size, scope and location, this is considered a new requirement.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES <br />Please describe your experience delivering the following capabilities:</p>
<p>1) Service Desk Support Services (Tier I) - provide services at a Contractor's U.S. based facility in an active/active configuration with a Facility Clearance at the SECRET level IAW DoD 5220.22, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual. This SECRET level clearance requirement applies to affiliates, team members, subcontractors, etc., that will require access to classified information. All Tier I services provided from the Contractor's US-based facilities must have network connectivity to NIPRNet and SIPRNet networks. The contractor's response should confirm that their facility has both NIPR and SIPR access at the time of this sources sought. In your response, please include information regarding your facilities' NIPR and SIPR access.</p>
<p>Specifically, does your company currently have a facilities with connectivity to NIPR and SIPR networks?<br />a. If yes, please provide location and type of connection. If the location is that of a partner, please provide partner's primary facility location and type of connection and connection bandwidth to NIPR and SIPR networks. <br />b. If your primary facility currently does not have NIPR and SIPR access, how long do you anticipate it would take to gain NIPR and SIPR access? (Please provide number of weeks, months, years, etc.)<br />c. How long does your company anticipate to be 100% operationally capable after receiving an award?<br />d. If the contractor does not have SIPR access at their facilities, please describe a current capability that could allow for SIPR access at the time of award.</p>
<p>The contractor's response should also show their ability to provide Service Desk Support on a 24 hour a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year basis to approximately 2.1M users world-wide, and their capabilities to support 207,084 interactions a month, either directly or indirectly based on application service level agreement requirements. Most of these users are expected to need Tier 1/Level 1 support and Tier 1 Level 2 support.</p>
<p>These services would support approximately 2,100,000 users across the globe and an average of 207,084 interactions. The current environment operates according to a 'level' and 'tier' support model. The 'levels' represent proximity of Service Desk agents to mission partners/customers, whereas the 'tiers' within those levels represent the different skill sets of the service desk agents. The various Tiers provide support that corresponds with levels of proximity to the end user. Tier I is a virtualized service desk with local support provided by dispatch labor. Touch labor only pertains to the DISA and the 4th Estate agencies internal support network.</p>
<p>Level 1 represents direct user support; Level 2 represents Service Desk-to-Service Desk support; and Level 3 represents external entities' support to the service desk (e.g. software vendor help desk support to internal service desks). This 'level' and 'tier' support model utilizes an enterprise trouble ticket workflow, an enterprise contact management system and knowledge centered support known as the Service Support Environment.</p>
<p>2) Desktop Support Services (Tier II) - provide touch labor services at the DISA and the 4th Estate agencies site locations. There are approximately 421 Tier 2 locations. These Tier 2 locations span across 50 CONUS and 36 OCONUS locations with an average of 90,620 tickets per month. (For example: One state may have multiple locations and/or buildings within close proximity). In order to support multiple locations, the contractor must demonstrate ability to provide virtual Tier 2 desktop support and end-user device support.</p>
<p>3) Hire contractor personnel that are citizens of the United States who possess a U.S. Secret Clearance. The contractor must have credible processes that demonstrate a complete and thorough ability to perform complete background checks and security clearances on 100% of contractor personnel.</p>
<p>4) Provide Certified HDI Support Center Analysts</p>
<p>5) Provide certified HDI Desktop Support Technicians (HDI-DST)</p>
<p>6) Does your company currently have a partnership agreement with another business to satisfy this new requirement? If yes, please provide the business type/size of the partner and the type of agreement between the two companies.</p>
<p><br />SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS<br />Onsite staff will require at least a minimum Secret Security Clearance with IT-1. Contractors assigned to positions that are classified as IAT Level 1, and IAT Level 2 must comply with requirements derived from DoD 8570 Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program.</p>

The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.
<div><br />&nbsp;
<p>The Open Period for OCTOBER* is OCTOBER 1, 2018 to OCTOBER 20, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.

Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period. Lease awards will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website and agency requirements noted in a project-specific advertisement to be posted separately.

<DESC>&nbsp; This notice is to notify industry that on September 26, 2018 a sole source requirement was awarded to American Safety and Health Institute, located in Chicago IL. This requirement was awarded to purchase training materials, student materials, and instructor application fee vouchers for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Automated External Defibrillator (AED) training. American Safety and Health Institute (ASHI) is the certifying organization currently used by the Office of Field Operations (OFO) to certify personnel in CPR/AED. The award will also provide instructional and student materials to the OFO field offices, and credential additional instructors within OFO The awarded amount for this purchase order was approximately $272,978.00.
<p>This sole source contract action was awarded under the authority of FAR 16.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A). A determination by the government not to compete this requirement in the future may be based upon responses to this notice, and shall be solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future. Any company who believes they can provide the required service should e-mail their company's capability information along with pricing to the attention of David Banks no later than 3:00p.m. EST, November 1, 2018 at david.m.banks@dhs.gov. Only e-mail responses will be accepted. The full sole source justification is available upon request.</p>
<p>The following information for the ASHI requirement is provided:</p>
<p>ASHI has been selected by CBP and many other DHS components to provide CPR and AED certifications. Unlike American Heart Association (AHA) and American Red Cross (ARC), ASHI allows the approved training center to be centralized, regardless of state and training center boundaries. For instance, the Advanced Training Center in Harpers Ferry, WV, when they were training AHA certification, could not train outside of the area served by Jefferson Medical Center, the AHA training center. ASHI is particularly beneficial to Federal agencies with multi-state footprints, as these boundaries do not affect the ability to provide the training to their workforce. Additionally, outside of startup costs of instructor materials and application fees, the cost per student for certification is limited to that of student materials (books and certification cards) rather than a per-student cost to the organization itself (AHA/ARC). This represents a substantial cost savings per-student. Finally, ASHI allows more flexibility in adding specialized, specific subject matter to their programs (e.g. naloxone administration) which AHA/ARC does not.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract no. DE-AC52-07NA27344 (Contract 44) with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">is offering the opportunity to partner to further develop and license for commercialization its novel low-cost laminated chip slapper technology.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Background</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">: </span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">A slapper detonator also known as an exploding foil initiator (EFI)</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">was originally developed by LLNL under US Patent US4788913 A. It was invented as an advancement to exploding bridgewire (EBW) detonators. Initiating secondary explosives in a safe and reliable manner is a technical problem. The benefit of an EFI detonator is that it is not in direct contact with the explosive element and the flyer layer protects the conductive bridge from the environment. These aspects increases both the safety and reliability of the detonator.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The current manufacturing method first deposits a conductive metal layer and then etches the metal layer to form a narrow bridge. The flyer layer is also deposited on, usually through spin coating of polyimide. These are both expensive processes. The main benefit of the new process is the cost efficiency. Instead of etching, a kapton mask is used to define the shape of the bridge. This mask process allows for the ability to easily customize the shape and size of the conductive bridge portion of the chip slapper.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Description</span></span></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Livermore researchers have developed a chip slapper consisting of a substrate with a conductive bridge layer and a flyer layer on one side of the substrate. The other side of the substrate consists of conductive pads. The bridge side of the substrate is electrically connected to the pad side of the substrate through a conductive pathway. The design and shape of the conductive bridge is manufactured using a masked physical vapor deposition process. The flyer layer is applied using a lamination technique.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 1.0in; text-indent: -1.0in;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">There are four key elements of the invention:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">First, is the production of the substrate. The substrate is a custom made alumina ceramic wafer. The bottom side of the wafer has a pattern of electroplated gold pads. A pattern of via holes are laser drilled and plated with gold to create a conductive pathway between the surfaces of the substrate.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The second element of the invention is the metalization of the conductive bridge to the top side of the substrate. A shadow mask is laser cut out of Kapton which establishes the pattern and shape of the conductive bridge. A machined "strongback" is cut to a similar but over sized pattern. The strongback is used to hold the Kapton mask flat during the vapor deposition process. The assembly is then run through an E-beam vapor deposition process to deposit the conductive bridge onto the surface of the substrate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The third element is the application of the "slapper" layer. A layer of kapton is adhered over the conductive bridge surface of the substrate using Pyralux adhesive. The lamination process is performed under vacuum.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">Fourth, the wafer is diced into individual chip slappers. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The novel aspects of the invention include the masked/PVD process of defining the bridge profile, use of electroplated substrate </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">with plated vias, and the laminated slapper.</span></span></span><br /><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;">The advantages of LLNL&rsquo;s low-cost laminated chip slapper include the masked/PVD process of defining the bridge profile, use of electroplated substrate with plated vias, and the laminated slapper.</span></p>

<DESC>Objective of this RFI<br />Based on its experience as a user of cloud services and through the Big Data Project, NOAA is seeking one or more contractual arrangements that would allow it to place a significant portion of its data in one or more cloud platforms, for its use and use by the public. Such use could be in the form of egress or cloud-based processing, to include high-performance computing. NOAA seeks to host data on cloud platforms to enable easier discoverability and access, allowing the untapped value of NOAA's data to be realized through the generation of novel products and services. <br /><br />In order to inform the future direction of the BDP, this RFI seeks direct input and feedback from all users of the data on their experience accessing NOAA's open data through one or more of the five BDP Collaborators' cloud platforms. In general, NOAA's OCIO is requesting information as to whether accessing the data in this manner is beneficial, and if so, the details on these benefits. Input is requested from the public, academia, researchers, and industry on the value of the access to the data through the Collaborators and the value of providing open access to the data. In addition, information is requested that particularly pertains to any business growth or contributions to new business services or new technology and scientific development related to accessing NOAA's data. NOAA will use this feedback to: 1) understand end user needs; and 2) understand the impact of NOAA data in the marketplace. Responses from this RFI will be compiled and made publicly available.<br />

Continued support from SEE will enable the SERDP/ESTCP office to complete ongoing projects efficiently, complete planned guidance and retain significant program knowledge and information.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers.

If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>

However, the Postal Service may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical or management features. The benefits of a higher priced proposal may merit a higher price.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE: The GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) program has recently experienced a tremendous increase in new offers. Due to the large number of new offers currently in process, it could take up to 9 months before your offer is reviewed.

GSA's practice is to evaluate offers in the order in which they are received. However, GSA may give priority to processing certain offers when circumstances dictate, such as when a federal agency Contracting Officer specifically requests an expedited offer review in order to meet a pending requirement that will be procured under the MAS program, or when there is a need for GSA to bring strategically critical new products or services to market in order to meet federal customer needs. In order for your offer to be considered under any of these unique circumstances, you should submit detailed customer correspondence and any other supporting documentation that fully explains all factors involved.



Description:

This is a standing solicitation for Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) 36 Office, Imaging and Document Solutions. This solicitation will be available electronically-only and includes all current applicable clauses. Interested parties may access the solicitation at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

Prospective contractors are required to complete and maintain electronic annual representations and certifications in the Online Representations and Certifications Application (SAM) database (http://sam.gov). Contractors are not eligible for an award, if such information is not current.

Resulting Contracts will be effective for a 5-year period beginning Date of Award and include an option to extend for three additional 5-year periods. Certified 8(a) firms can participate in the MAS Program. Submission of products with environmental attributes is encouraged.

You may find more information about this program at various online sites, including GSA Advantage! (www.gsaadvantage.gov), Schedules e-Library (www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov) and the Vendor Support Center (VSC) http://vsc.gsa.gov.

<p>Prices shall be inclusive of shipping and handling.</p>
<p>Offerors are afforded the opportunity to inspect the equipment, at their own expense, prior to the date set for receipt of quotes by contacting the Contract Specialist/Contracting Officer identified herein to schedule an appointment.  Failure to inspect the equipment will not relieve the successful offeror from fully meeting the requirements of the resulting contract at the price offered.</p>
<p>Prices shall be firm through September 30, 2019.</p>
<p>In order for the quote to be determined technically capable, the vendor shall demonstrate that its proposed technical solution meets or exceeds the stated requirements.   Price proposal must be detailed and represent the offeror's response to the schedule of items above.</p>
<p>Technical Capability: Will be determined by review of information submitted by the offeror which must provide sufficient technical information necessary for the Government to conclusively determine that the offered services meet or exceed the technical requirements identified above. Provide written approach to satisfy all of the requirements herein, if not the OEM, demonstrated and verifiable prior experience providing the same or near-same repair and support activities for this OEM equipment to include qualifications of field service engineers/technicians, a verifiable established supply chain with the OEM for specifications, manuals, bulletins, software and firmware updates, parts, components, subassemblies, reach-back technical support, etc. necessary to deliver the services herein.  Approach may be supplemented with technical specifications, descriptive material, literature, brochures, publications, etc. which the offeror believes will further demonstrate their technical capability to deliver the required services.<br />Past Performance: Provide recent (within the last 3 years) and relevant prior experience information for the preventative maintenance, repair and technical support of the same or substantially similar (BD LSRFortessa X-20) Preventive Maintenance to include period of performance, description (how is this relevant to current requirement), your role and responsibilities as either prime or subcontractor, dollar value, client name, client address, client point of contact name, client point of contact phone number, and client point of contact email address. Respondents who do not provide a valid email address for the client POC or without a relevant record of past performance or for whom information on current or past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably. Favorable past performance is considered higher than neutral past.<br />The offeror or applicant shall submit all electronic documents for Microsoft Office suite products without the use of "macros". If the offeror or applicant submits documents that contain macros the Government will not be able to view or open such documents and the submission will be considered non-responsive to the solicitation. No additional time will be given to an offeror or applicant to correct the document submission and the Government will not inform the offeror or applicant that their submission is non-responsive prior to award. It is the offeror's or applicant's responsibility to ensure all electronic documents are submitted without the use of macros.<br />Price: Provide detailed price quote for each service/item proposed to meet the Schedule of Items. Include the firm's DUNS number with quote. The option year service agreement periods will not be funded at time of award. If exercised, funding will be obligated individually each year for the option period exercised via contract modification; the option periods shall be priced accordingly.</p>
<p>The Government is not responsible for locating or securing any information, which is not identified in the proposal, however the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items applies. (Oct 2014)</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items</p>
<p>The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>-	Technical Capability<br />-	Past Performance<br />-	Price</p>
<p>Technical capability and past performance, when combined, are more important than price.  However, if the Government determines non-price factors to be essentially equal among competing offerors price becomes more important as a discriminating factor.</p>
<p>Options: The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise expressly notified by the Offeror, all quotes received in response to this solicitation shall be evaluated under the premise that the Offeror certifies that the combination of equipment maintenance/repair services its proposing to fulfill this requirement are exempt from the Service Contract Act per the conditions set forth in FAR 52.222-48 &amp; FAR 22.1003-4(c). Based on this premise that the Offeror certifies that its proposed services are exempt under the terms and conditions of 52.222-48, FAR clause 52.222-51-Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment-Requirements will be applicable to the resulting order. In the event that an Offeror determines its proposed services do not meet the exemption, they are to expressly notify the Contracting Officer in their quotation and the traditional Service Contract Act clauses 52.222-41, and 52.222-43 shall be included in the resulting order award as well as Wage Determination WD 15-4269 (Rev.-7) (first posted on July 24, 2018) https://www.wdol.gov/wdol/scafiles/std/15-4269.txt?v=7<br />FAR CLAUSE 52.222-48 Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment-Certification (May 2014) <br />(a) The offeror shall check the following certification: <br />CERTIFICATION<br />The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that- <br />(1) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Government purposes, and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontractor) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(2) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of equipment. <br />(i) An "established catalog price" is a price included in a catalog, price list, schedule, or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or the offeror, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by customers, and states prices at which sales currently, or were last, made to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public. <br />(ii) An "established market price" is a current price, established in the usual course of trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain, which can be substantiated from sources independent of the manufacturer or offeror; and <br />(3) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract are the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />(b) Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services. If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(c)(3) that the Service Contract Labor Standards statute- <br />(1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Labor Standards clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or <br />(2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at 52.222-51, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment-Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offeror, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis. <br />(c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision- <br />(1) The clause in this solicitation at 52.222-51, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Labor Standards to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment-Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offeror; and <br />(2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible, if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation. <br />(d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Aug 2018)</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.

NIST reserves the right to make award to other than the lowest-priced offeror or the offeror ranked highest technically, if it determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.<br />An offerors failure to address any factors may be considered indicative of the offerors lack of understanding of the Government's requirements and may result in the offer being determined unacceptable. <br />EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD:<br />The Government intends to use the tradeoff method to award a single, firm-fixed price Purchase Order resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, non-price and price factors considered. NIST reserves the right to make award to other than the lowest-priced offeror or to the offeror ranked highest technically, if it determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.<br />The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: <br />1) Technical Approach <br />2) Key Personnel <br />3) Past Performance<br />4) Price</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate Technical Approach, Key Personnel, Past Performance, and Price. Technical Approach, Key Personnel and Past Performance are equal in importance. The non-factors are both individually and when combined more important than to price.</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Approach</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's technical approach and capability to assess the offeror's ability to perform the services listed in the SOW and to determine its overall understanding of the requirements to the extent which its proposed approach will ensure successful performance of this effort. <br />Factor 2: Key Personnel <br />The Government will evaluate the extent to which the offeror's proposed personnel will lead to successful performance of this purchase order, and the extent to which the offeror's proposed key personnel meet or exceed the minimum requirements.<br />Factor 3: Past Performance <br />The Government will evaluate the Offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its<br />proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement<br />and the extent to which it demonstrates that the Offeror has successfully completed relevant <br />contracts in the past five years. In assessing the Offeror's past performance information, NIST<br />will evaluate, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and<br />timeliness of delivery of goods and services, cost management, communications between<br />contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction. Evaluation of this factor<br />will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information<br />provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by<br />contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government<br />may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror's past performance. The<br />Government will assign a neutral rating if the Offeror has no relevant past performance<br />information. <br /><br />NOTE -- If an Offeror does not have a history of relevant contract experience, or if past performance information is not available, the Offeror will receive a neutral past performance rating.</p>
<p>Factor 4: Price<br />Price will be evaluated for reasonableness. Your company is encouraged to discount its rates. If price discounts are offered, identify the percentage of price discount and/or price reduction offered.<br />The Government does not intend to enter into discussion and may award a purchase order on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions. Therefore, each initial quotation shall contain the offeror's best terms. Nonetheless, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is in the best interest of the Government. <br />Due Date and Response Information <br />Offerors capable of furnishing the specified repair in this combined synopsis/solicitation should submit their quote in writing to: Prateema Carvajal electronically at prateema.carvajal@nist.gov. FAX quotations shall not be accepted. Offerors shall submit their quotations so that NIST receives them not later than August 17, 2018, 8:00 am, EST.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED; AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT (I.E. STANDARD FORM) WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<div><br /></div>
<div>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-98.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. The small business size standard is $15M. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small businesses. Simplified acquisition procedures will be utilized.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</span></strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) can be described as smart systems that encompass computational (i.e., hardware and software) and physical components, seamlessly integrated and closely interacting to sense and respond to the changing state of the real world. These systems involve a high degree of complexity at numerous spatial and temporal scales and highly networked communications integrating computational and physical components.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>In particular, the smart grid is considered an example of a cyber-physical system, one in which NIST has a mandated role.  Under Title XIII, Section 1305 of the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, the U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has "primary responsibility to coordinate development of a framework that includes protocols and model standards for information management to achieve interoperability of Smart Grid devices and systems." This role provides a catalyst for a timelier deployment of a secure and reliable smart grid that upgrades the aging electrical power grid infrastructure.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The NIST Smart Grid and Cyber Physical Systems Program Office coordinates cyber-physical systems development (including smart grid) through various activities outlined in a series of workshop reports and in the EISA 2007 legislation.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Engaging, timely communications with stakeholders for the NIST Cyber-Physical Systems and Smart Grid program is an essential necessary element for the program to achieve its goals. These stakeholders are extremely diverse and include senior-level federal officials; state and local electrical power regulators and companies; elected officials; electronic and IT equipment manufacturers; and consumers.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>To ensure that stakeholders are fully informed about the very wide range of activities affecting development of standards and deployment of smart grid infrastructure components, the NIST Cyber-Physical Systems and Smart Grid program requires professional communications support services from a Contractor with demonstrated technical knowledge of the fields of physical science (especially energy research), electronics, and information technology, as well as proven ability to translate complex technical materials into engaging Web site content, reports, and other communications products intended for a broad public audience.</div>
<div><br /></div>

<DESC>This solicitation is UNRESTRICTED AND OPEN TO BOTH LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION.
<p>It is highly suggested that Contractors attend the site visit on Thursday, August 2, 2018 starting at 10:00 AM Mountain Time, to allow them the best opportunity to fully understand the scope of this project. Prospective bidders will be given a site visit of the construction site approximately two weeks after issuance of the Invitation for Bids. The exact date and time of the site visit will be included in the solicitation. Contractors are to meet in the parking lot adjacent to the Cenex Gas Station on Highway 16 just south of the exit off of Interstate 94, in Glendive Montana.</p>
<p>DO NOT submit requests for plans and specifications to the site visit personnel listed above. See &lsquo;Obtaining Solicitation Documents' below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Description: (Approx. quantities)<br /> <br />Construct a replacement irrigation diversion weir across the Lower Yellowstone River and fish bypass channel through Joe's Island. The weir consists of a steel W-pile section foundation with reinforced concrete crest structure capping it, and will be upstream of an existing wooden weir constructed in 1911-1912, with riprap placed between the weirs. Ninety-four W-pile sections are driven to a depth of approximately 37 feet. The weir length is approximately 700 linear feet and amount of formed reinforced concrete is approximately 500 cubic yards. The construction requires the use of sheet pile coffering and constructed in segments in order to not block the entire river.</p>
<p>Bypass channel will be approximately 2.2 miles long with ~75-foot bottom width, ~200-foot top width, ~18 feet average excavation depth with varying side slopes. The channel side slopes will be protected with a layer of riprap on bends, the invert and side slopes protected with cobbles processed from the excavation, and the entrance and exit and two locations within the channel protected with riprap structures. The channel excavation requires intense dewatering system to be designed by the Contractor, and earthen cofferdams at the channel entrance and exit.</p>
<p>Approximate quantities are as follows: ~980,000 CY of excavation, ~99,000 Tons of quarried riprap, and ~34,000 CY of cobbles for invert protection. Most of the excavation will be wasted on Joe's Island in an existing natural high-flow channel for a length of ~9000 feet.</p>
<p>Project will also require seeding and planting of trees and resurfacing an access road for approximately 6000 linear feet. Relocation of a historic wooden cableway tower and a building to new locations, and removal and coiling of cable that spans the river. The work scheduling will be affected by irrigation and fish passage dates.</p>
<p>The estimated construction cost of this project is between $40,000,000 and $50,000,000.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to commence work within 10 days after notice to proceed and complete the work 900 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed. Provisions will be included for liquidated damages in case of failure to complete the work in the time allowed. Performance and payment bonds will be required. Bonding documents including the power of attorney shall bear an original signature by an officer of the surety.</p>
<p>Bidders (Offerors):<br />Please be advised of on-line registration requirement for Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) is now located in System for Award Management (SAM) database https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.<br />Representations and certifications are required to be updated annually as a minimum to keep information current, accurate and complete. The electronic annual representations and certifications are effective until one year from date of submission or update to SAM.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC><p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">1. OVERVIEW</span></p>
<p>(a) The purpose of this announcement is to solicit qualified offerors to submit proposals for the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center - Consortium Initiative (ACI). ACI aims to enable the Air Force to acquire prototypes at the pace of commercial innovation, from the widest possible pool of prospective suppliers. To achieve this aim, the Government is exploring options regarding competitive award of a 10 U.S.C. &sect;2371b other transaction (OT) agreement to a consortium manager to create a new or leverage an existing consortium of large and small organizations, representing traditional and non-traditional Defense contractors, as well as academic institutions. Other Department of Defense organizations may utilize this OT agreement. The consortium manager must have the ability to manage competition, award, and administration of individual prototype projects with substantial participation from nontraditional defense contractors. The mission of the consortium will include performing research, development, and test and evaluation within prototyping projects that address requirements presented by, or of interest to, the US Government.</p>
<p>(b) It is the Government's intention to enter into an OT agreement with only one consortium manager that can best meet the Government's defined scope provided below. By definition, a consortium is an organized group of entities that agree to participate under a common rule set. The consortium should be open to new membership and display a broad array of expertise and experience connected to the domains identified herein. Prospective members must agree to the terms of the consortium. A consortium comprised of educational, nonprofit, and commercial organizations with broad and open membership is required to provide the Government a partner able to collaborate across barriers that include military/civilian, public/private, local/regional/national, and political/jurisdictional matters and concerns.</p>
<p>(c) The Consortium Manager can be an individual, a for profit organization, or a not-for-profit corporation. The consortium manager will serve as an independent agent of the Government and will not be eligible to compete for project awards. The consortium manager will serve as the broker for the individual prototype project agreements. In other words, the Government sends the funds to the consortium manager; the consortium manager takes the appropriate fee for service per the terms set forth in the consortium OT agreement; and the consortium manager then delivers the remaining funds to the performers per the terms of the project transaction.</p>
<p>(d) The Government anticipates that ACI will be awarded as an Other Transaction (OT) Agreement for Prototype Projects, as authorized under 10 U.S.C. &sect;2371b. The resulting agreement is expected to be valued at a maximum funding ceiling of $100M, with a performance period of one year base period of performance with four, one-year options (for a total of five years). Note: this ceiling is likely to grow to $500M or higher. It is anticipated that this OT agreement will be funded on a Firm Fixed Price basis, in increments, with pricing based on the outcome of an indefinite number of individual prototype project-level competitions and individual prototype project agreements. Despite the Firm Fixed Price nature of the Agreement, the consortium manager will need to identify an accounting system that is capable of tracking the receipt of Government funding and the resolution of milestone payments.</p>
<p>(e) Deliverables are expected to consist nearly entirely of prototypes (software, hardware, and/or technical documentation). Periodic reports will be required for the overall program.</p>
<p>2. SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>(a) The United States Air Force has identified the need for an AFLCMC OT Consortium to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the military aviation acquisition process. This consortium would perform critical research, development, test, and evaluation within prototyping projects supporting the AFLCMC mission areas identified within Section 2(b) below. The core objective of ACI is to create a mutually beneficial environment between the Government and industry/academia that fosters collaboration to close the gap between existing technology/capability and performance threshold requirements within the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center's (AFLCMC's) mission sets detailed in section 2(b) below.</p>
<p>(b) The scope of AFLCMC prototyping projects might include any topic generally consistent with the research, development, test and evaluation within prototyping projects of the AFLCMC mission sets. These mission sets include, but are not limited to: weapon system and commercial derivative aircraft platforms; battle management; simulators; human systems; clothing/uniforms; business enterprise systems; command, control, communications, intelligence and networks; armament, support equipment and vehicles; automatic test systems; electronic warfare and avionics; information, surveillance, reconnaissance and special operations; aircraft integration, and aircraft subsystems. It is anticipated that ACI will promote competition for individual prototype projects through a two-step white paper/proposal process.</p>
<p>(c) AFLCMC aims to take advantage of the inherent flexibility afforded by other transactions for prototyping authority to achieve the following general objectives.<br />&bull; Expose AFLCMC requirements to, and lower barriers to entry for, the broad community of traditional and nontraditional solution providers.<br />&bull; Encourage rapid solicitation to award timelines.<br />&bull; Employ objective, test-based, Validation and Verification as basis of Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), trade analysis, source selection, and performance monitoring.<br />&bull; Develop Intellectual Property Regimes (IPR) and Data Rights that incentivize mutually beneficial government-industry partnership.<br />&bull; Transition successfully tested prototype applications as vendor-supported off-the-shelf products.<br />&bull; Continuously evolve an appropriately "open" technical architecture that optimizes government investment by both leveraging best available existing commercial technology and developing new technology in partnership with industry.<br />&bull; Minimize risk of technology perishability by executing rapid, iterative, evolutionary, demonstration-to-delivery cycles.</p>
<p>3. LIMITATIONS OF OT AUTHORITY</p>
<p>(a) Individual project-level agreements issued under the resulting OT Agreement must be limited to prototype projects that are directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components, or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the Department of Defense, or improvements to the platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the armed forces.</p>
<p>(b) To the maximum extent practicable, the individual prototype projects shall be awarded on a competitive basis, in order to provide for the opportunity to award a follow-on prototype agreement or follow-on production contract or transaction to the participants in the individual prototype projects. Further, the individual prototype projects may provide for prototypes or follow-on production items to be provided to another contractor as Government-furnished equipment.</p>
<p>(c) At least one third of the total cost of each prototype project is to be paid out of funds provided by sources other than the Federal Government unless one of the following applies:</p>
<p>a. There is at least one nontraditional defense contractor or nonprofit research institution participating to a significant extent in the prototype project;</p>
<p>b. All significant participants in the transaction other than the Federal Government are small businesses (including small business participating in a program described under section 9 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638)); or</p>
<p>c. The senior procurement executive for the agency determines in writing that exceptional circumstances justify the use of a transaction that provides for innovative business arrangements or structures that would not be feasible or appropriate under a contract, or would provide an opportunity to expand the defense supply base in a manner that would not be practical or feasible under a contract.</p>
<p>(d) For purposes of these limitations identified in Sections 3(a)-3(c) above, the following definitions apply:</p>
<p>&bull; Prototype Project / Individual Prototype Project - A prototype project can generally be described as a preliminary pilot, test, evaluation, demonstration, or agile development activity used to evaluate the technical or manufacturing feasibility or military utility of a technology, process, concept, end item, effect, or other discrete feature. Prototype projects may include systems, subsystems, components, materials, methodology, technology, or processes. A prototype project may involve a: proof of concept; a pilot; a novel application of commercial technologies for defense purposes; a creation, design, development, demonstration of technical or operational utility; or combinations of the foregoing, related to a prototype. <br />&bull; Small Business - a small business concern as defined under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). This definition also includes small businesses participating in a program described under section 9 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 638), e.g., Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program participants.</p>
<p>&bull; "Directly relevant to enhancing military capabilities" - development that enhances mission effectiveness of military personnel and supporting platforms, systems, components, or materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the Department of Defense, or improvement of platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>&bull; Nontraditional Defense Contractor - any entity that is not currently performing and has not performed, for at least one year preceding solicitation of this agreement, any contract or subcontract subject to the full Cost Accounting Standards coverage required by 41 U.S.C. &sect; 1502.</p>
<p>&bull; "Participating to a significant extent" - supplying new key technology or products; accomplishing a significant amount of the effort; causing a material reduction in the cost or schedule, and/or causing an increase in the performance of the work effort. In order to be relieved of the one third cost share requirement, the prime traditional contractor must submit documentation describing the significant participation of the nontraditional contractor, which must be approved by the cognizant Agreements Officer.</p>
<p>4. PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>(a) Interested parties are requested to respond to this combined synopsis/solicitation with a proposal.</p>
<p>(b) Proposals in Microsoft Word for Office compatible format are due no later than&nbsp;5 October 2018, 1700 EST. Submissions are limited to 20 pages. Any supporting information, such as Consortium Membership Agreements, Letters of Intent, etc., must be included in the addendum (the addendum does not count against the 20-page submission limit). Responses shall be limited to 20 pages and submitted via email only to the Agreements Officer, Kari Wedemeyer at kari.wedemeyer@us.af.mil no later than 1 October 2018, 1700 EST. Any proposals received after this date and time will not be evaluated. As a practical matter, existing consortia that submit proposals must be represented by consortium managers with means and authority to speak for the members, organize their activities, and make binding agreements on their behalf.</p>
<p>(c) For standardization purposes, each proposal shall include relevant information in the following format:<br />(i) Section 1:<br />Administrative information, to include the following as a minimum: <br />1. A cover page labeled with the heading, "Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) -Consortium Initiative," name of company, name of corporate point of contact (POC), name of technical POC, telephone number for each POC, mailing address, email addresses for each POC, CAGE code, and any other pertinent information.</p>
<p>2. Business type for the offeror.</p>
<p>a. Business types may be: non-profit, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a)-certified small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business.<br />b. Business types shall be based upon North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.</p>
<p>3. The facility security clearance of the offeror, to include capability to handle classified material up to and including SECRET.</p>
<p>4. Proposed process for handling sensitive materials (FOUO, proprietary, etc.).</p>
<p>(ii) Section 2<br />Performance Management/Technical information, to include the following:<br />1. How the objectives would be addressed and performance against objectives would be measured. Provide evidence of ability to meet government objectives by:</p>
<p>a. Recommending a competitive process and operational procedures for handling requests for individual prototype projects. This should include procedures for handling white papers, full proposals, and projects that are determined to have merit, but for which no funding is available.</p>
<p>b. Performing fiduciary tasks associated with transferring funds from government to individual prototype project participants.</p>
<p>c. Performing targeted recruiting of new individual prototype project participants.</p>
<p>d. Facilitating teaming among individual prototype project participants.</p>
<p>e. Providing services associated with domain technological expertise such as:<br />i. Independent Validation and Verification<br />ii. Capturing and documenting standards and best practices<br />iii. Performing training<br />iv. Facilitating technical exchange</p>
<p>f. Supporting and managing consortium communications in the following manner:<br />i. Providing a centralized capability, such as a website, containing and organizing the consortium's information for easy access by US Government customers<br />ii. Providing US Government customers with prototyping resources and important OT information<br />iii. Providing secure data portal capable of transferring and storing FOUO and proprietary information<br />iv. Providing membership information (i.e., member listing and contact information)</p>
<p>g. Suggesting innovative fee structures designed to incentivize achievement of government objectives. It is anticipated that the consortium will operate on a fee-for-service basis. Examples include, but are not limited to:<br />i. Fixed transaction fee (same fee regardless of individual prototype project price)<br />ii. Tiered transaction fees (fees vary for individual prototype projects that fall within different price ranges) based on individual prototype project price, and/or services rendered, adjusted to exclude hardware, material, and travel costs. Note: The exclusion of hardware, materials, and travel costs from the fee calculation is intended to capture labor costs as the main indicator of risk in a given project, which may lead to more challenging management during the performance of a given project. Individual prototype projects that consist in large part of material, hardware, and/or travel are perceived to be less risky and require less potential for substantial involvement on the part of the consortium lead.<br />iii. Percentage of price up to a maximum dollar amount based on project price adjusted to exclude hardware, materials, and travel costs<br />iv. Percentage of project price up to a maximum dollar amount</p>
<p>h. Providing corporate competencies and past performance with respect to Government objectives and selection criteria. Explain experience with regard to consortium management in context with government and/or commercial applications.</p>
<p>i. Describing experience working on projects with the Federal Government, State and Local Governments, academia, and/or industry. Include affiliations, associations, and specific involvement in and with the federal and non-federal research and development, testing and engineering community, sufficient to demonstrate a well-established presence in that community.</p>
<p>j. Providing a proposed schedule for consortium establishment, if one does not currently exist.</p>
<p>(iii) Addendum<br />The Addendum to the proposal will not be included in the page count. The addendum shall be comprised of a proposed consortium charter that includes:<br />a. Proposed Consortium by-laws;</p>
<p>b. Proposed Consortium membership process;</p>
<p>c. Proposed consortium membership fees; and</p>
<p>d. Proposed consortium membership requirements</p>
<p>5. EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>(a) The government will perform an integrated assessment of each proposal to make a final determination of which consortium provides the best value to the Government. For evaluation purposes, the following criteria will be assessed, in no relative order of importance:</p>
<p>&bull; Factor 1: Strategy for attracting, retaining, and expanding consortium membership. The Government will evaluate the consortium manager's strategy as it relates to the openness of the consortium, in particular the ease with which new members are able to join and participate; specific actions intended to expedite formation of the consortium; specific actions intended to ensure the consortium membership aligns with the mission areas identified above; and plans to grow and mature the consortium membership base.</p>
<p>&bull; Factor 2: Strategy for coordinating and assisting activities of consortium members at the individual prototype project level. The Government will evaluate the consortium's strategy as it relates to the processes by which the consortium will assist the project-level member with proposal preparation, proposal analysis, co-development and integration, test and evaluation, progress reporting, invoicing and expedited payments, intellectual property, and project close-out.</p>
<p>&bull; Factor 3: Schedule for the consortium to be established. The Government will evaluate the proposed consortium implementation plan and timeline to determine when the consortium will be capable of competing Government prototype requirements. The Government intends to solicit for individual prototype projects upon execution of the consortium OT agreement.</p>
<p>&bull; Factor 4: Recommended competition processes and operational procedures. The Government will evaluate the proposed competition process and operational procedures for prototype projects that the consortium believes is the best fit for the consortium OT agreement.</p>
<p>&bull; Factor 5: Organizational and fee structure of the consortium. The Government will evaluate the proposed organizational and fee structure of the consortium, to include Consortium Metrics, Management Framework of Consortium, Reporting, Articles of Collaboration/By-Laws, Consortium Member Agreement, innovative fee structures designed to incentivize achievement of government objectives, and any other relative information on how the consortium intends to operate. A consortium managed by a Consortium Management Firm is preferred.</p>
<p>6. EVALUATION RATINGS</p>
<p>Each of the six factors identified in Section 5 above will receive an evaluation rating supported by justification in the Government's decision of which one consortium best meets the Government's needs. The following ratings will be utilized:</p>
<p>&bull; Good: The proposal demonstrates a thorough approach and understanding of the requirements. The prospective consortium has provided a comprehensive and detailed plan in accordance with the evaluation criteria as outlined in the combined synopsis/solicitation. The risk of unsuccessful performance is low.</p>
<p>&bull; Acceptable: The proposal demonstrates an adequate approach and understanding of the requirements. The prospective consortium has provided an adequate plan in accordance with the evaluation criteria as outlined in the combined synopsis/solicitation. The risk of unsuccessful performance is no worse than moderate.</p>
<p>&bull; Unacceptable: The proposal does not demonstrate an ability to meet or understand the Government requirements. The prospective consortium did not provide a plan in accordance with the evaluation criteria as outlined in the combined synopsis/solicitation. The risk of unsuccessful performance is high.</p>
<p>7. COMMUNICATIONS WITH OFFERORS AND FINAL PROPOSAL REVISIONS</p>
<p>The Government will perform an initial review of the proposal(s) submitted. The Government reserves the right to make an award based on the initial proposals submitted in response to this synopsis/solicitation notice without further interactions. Proposals that do not contain the information requested are at risk of being determined Unacceptable in accordance with the evaluation ratings above. If the Government determines that further interactions and/or an opportunity to revise proposals is necessary, the Government reserves the right to contact all, some, or none of the offerors and/or request proposal revisions.</p>
<p>8. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS</p>
<p>(a) Government Property: Government Property is not currently being provided. It is not anticipated that the consortium manager will require access to Government Property in order to carry out its role in this acquisition. Use of Government Property may be considered for individual project agreements. Terms and conditions regarding the tracking, use, disposition, and title to Government Property will be included in the resulting agreement to provide the framework for providing Government Property to individual project prototype performers. It is understood and accepted that time may be needed to implement Government Property requirements upon the first instance of property being provided. It is also understood that projects that require Government Property may take longer to award than those without property requirements.</p>
<p>(b) Security Clearance/Classification: The consortium manager will be responsible for coordinating clearance verification, access, and safeguarding of required classified resources. Tracking and disposition of this support will be the consortium manager's responsibility upon conclusion of the individual prototype project effort(s). Base Support and Government network access are not anticipated for the consortium manager or the individual prototype project performers at this time.</p>
<p>(c) Intellectual Property: with the exception of commercial software, which will be handled through commercial licensing, all software and technical data developed by the consortium manager or the individual prototype project performers is anticipated to be delivered with the following Government Purpose Rights: the rights to</p>
<p>&bull; Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation within the Government without restriction; and<br />&bull; Release or disclose technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation for United States Government purpose. <br />This definition applies to noncommercial technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation.<br />The Government reserves its right to negotiate intellectual property rights that differ from what is described above, as necessary.<br />(d) Accreditation:</p>
<p>Performers should note that some military information systems require access to source code for accreditation purposes. Accreditation is a part of security testing for certain Information Systems. The accreditation process is tailored to each new Information System, so the need for source code must be determined on a case-by-case basis and will vary based on the system program office associated with each project. The Government will make every attempt to identify the extent to which code will be required to complete accreditation and provide this information with the initial prototype project announcement. Any source code requirements will be captured in the project approval letter that the Government will send to the consortium manager following selection of a successful proposal. In such cases, source code requirements will also be included in the individual prototype project agreement between the consortium manager and the individual prototype project performer.</p>
<p>(e) Organizational Conflicts of Interest:</p>
<p>All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest must be disclosed (i.e., Offerors must disclose those situations in which, because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person or organization is unable or potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person or organization's objectivity in performing the agreement work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person or organization has an unfair competitive advantage). The disclosure shall include a description of the potential conflict as well as the action the Offeror has taken or proposes to take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict. Proposals that fail to fully disclose potential conflicts of interest and/or do not have plans to mitigate this conflict may be rejected without evaluation and withdrawn from further consideration for award.</p>
<p>Throughout performance, the consortium manager will be required to monitor potential conflicts of interest between its individual project level performers and the contractors currently developing for and operating the targeted systems.</p>
<p>9. SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>(a) Specific terms and conditions of the resulting OT agreement will be negotiated and finalized with the selected consortium prior to award.</p>
<p>(b) The Government intends to make a 10 U.S.C. &sect;2371b OT agreement based on proposals submitted in response to this competitive combined synopsis/solicitation notice. All information in response to this notice is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government will publish an Intent to Award Announcement to FedBizOpps upon selection of a consortium in response to this combined synopsis/solicitation. The Government does not intend to provide debriefings to unsuccessful respondents. A notice of the Government's consortium award selection will be announced on FedBizOpps upon the conclusion of the evaluation process.</p>
<p>(c) Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned. No sensitive or classified information will be discussed. Foreign-owned, controlled, or influenced firms are advised that security restrictions may apply that may preclude their participation in these efforts.</p>
<p>(d) The most effective time to handle potential problems is during the proposal preparation stage, i.e., prior to the proposal due date, not in the proposal. Therefore, if a prospective Offeror believes that any conflict of interest exists or may exist (whether organizational or otherwise), the Offeror is strongly encouraged to promptly raise the issue with the Agreements Officer by sending Offeror's contact information and a summary of the potential conflict by email to kari.wedemeyer@us.af.mil before time and effort are expended in preparing a proposal and mitigation plan. If, in the sole opinion of the Government after full consideration of the circumstances (including review of the Offeror's mitigation plan), any conflict situation cannot be effectively mitigated, the proposal may be returned without evaluation and withdrawn from further consideration for award under this combined synopsis/solicitation.</p>
<p>(e) For planning purposes only, offerors should assume an award date of 6 November 2018; however, proposals in response to this combined synopsis/solicitation will be assumed to be valid for 180 days from receipt of offer.</p>

The law and implementing regulation (32 CFR Section 199.21) describe the process by which the DoD Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&amp;T) Committee will consider the relative clinical effectiveness and relative cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical agents in a therapeutic class in recommending the selection of agents for the DoD Uniform Formulary (UF) and, for cost sharing purposes, the classification of a pharmaceutical agent as generic, formulary, Basic Core Formulary (BCF), Extended Core Formulary (ECF), or non-formulary (NF). Prior to the scheduled P&amp;T Committee meeting, a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for pharmaceutical agents within Drug Classes identified for placement on the UF has been issued to obtain quotes from industry. The Defense Health Agency may award Uniform Formulary Blanket Purchase Agreements (UF BPA) and the Uniform Formulary Additional Discount Program Agreements (UF ADP) based on the UF decision. This process is described in the attached RFQ.
<p>P&amp;T COMMITTEE MEETING: November 2018: The following drug classes/subclass and newly approved agents will be reviewed: <br /><br />ACNE AGENTS - TOPICAL ACNE AND ROSACEA: Adapeline, Plixda<br /><br />NARCOTIC ANALGESICS AND COMBINATIONS - N/A: Butalbital<br /><br />HEMATOLOGICAL AGENTS - WHITE BLOOD CELL STIMULANTS: Fulphila<br /><br />METABOLIC AGENTS-MISCELLANEOUS - N/A: Galafold<br /><br />TARGETED IMMUNOMODULATORY BIOLOGICS - NON TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR INHIBITORS: Ilumya<br /><br />BETA BLOCKERS &amp; HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE COMBINATIONS - N/A: Kapspargo Sprinkle<br /><br />BINDERS-CHELATORS-ANTIDOTES-OVERDOSE-AGENTS- N/A: Lokelma<br /><br />HEMATOLOGICAL AGENTS - PLATELETS: Mulpleta<br /><br />ANTIBIOTICS - TETRACYCLINES: Okebo<br /><br />LUTEINIZING HORMONE-RELEASING HORMONE AGONISTS-ANTAGONISTS - N/A: Orilissa<br /><br />CYSTIC FIBROSIS AGENTS - N/A: Orkambi Granule<br /><br />LAXATIVES-CATHARTICS-STOOL SOFTENERS - N/A: Plenvu<br /><br />ANTIPERSPIRANTS - N/A: Qbrexza<br /><br />ANTIRETROVIRALS - COMBINATIONS: Symtuza<br /><br />CORTICOSTEROIDS-IMMUNE MODULATORS - HEREDITARY ANGIOEDEMA AGENTS: Takhzyro<br /><br />ONCOLOGICAL AGENTS - ACUTE MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA: Tibsovo</p>
<p>RFQ: The RFQ, including UF BPA and UF ADP appendices are attached herein. <br />There is no pre-proposal teleconference. Rather, questions shall be submitted via e-mail to the Request for Quote (RFQ) Point of Contact stated in Part 2.3, no later than the date stated in Part 2.4.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED; AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT (I.E. STANDARD FORM) WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<div><br /></div>
<div>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-98.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. The small business size standard is $15M. This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small businesses. Simplified acquisition procedures will be utilized.</div>

<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</span></strong></div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Cyber-physical systems (CPS) can be described as smart systems that encompass computational (i.e., hardware and software) and physical components, seamlessly integrated and closely interacting to sense and respond to the changing state of the real world. These systems involve a high degree of complexity at numerous spatial and temporal scales and highly networked communications integrating computational and physical components.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>In particular, the smart grid is considered an example of a cyber-physical system, one in which NIST has a mandated role.  Under Title XIII, Section 1305 of the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, the U. S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has "primary responsibility to coordinate development of a framework that includes protocols and model standards for information management to achieve interoperability of Smart Grid devices and systems." This role provides a catalyst for a timelier deployment of a secure and reliable smart grid that upgrades the aging electrical power grid infrastructure.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The NIST Smart Grid and Cyber Physical Systems Program Office coordinates cyber-physical systems development (including smart grid) through various activities outlined in a series of workshop reports and in the EISA 2007 legislation.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Engaging, timely communications with stakeholders for the NIST Cyber-Physical Systems and Smart Grid program is an essential necessary element for the program to achieve its goals. These stakeholders are extremely diverse and include senior-level federal officials; state and local electrical power regulators and companies; elected officials; electronic and IT equipment manufacturers; and consumers.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>To ensure that stakeholders are fully informed about the very wide range of activities affecting development of standards and deployment of smart grid infrastructure components, the NIST Cyber-Physical Systems and Smart Grid program requires professional communications support services from a Contractor with demonstrated technical knowledge of the fields of physical science (especially energy research), electronics, and information technology, as well as proven ability to translate complex technical materials into engaging Web site content, reports, and other communications products intended for a broad public audience.</div>

<DESC>This solicitation is UNRESTRICTED AND OPEN TO BOTH LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION.
<p>It is highly suggested that Contractors attend the site visit on Thursday, August 2, 2018 starting at 10:00 AM Mountain Time, to allow them the best opportunity to fully understand the scope of this project. Prospective bidders will be given a site visit of the construction site approximately two weeks after issuance of the Invitation for Bids. The exact date and time of the site visit will be included in the solicitation. Contractors are to meet in the parking lot adjacent to the Cenex Gas Station on Highway 16 just south of the exit off of Interstate 94, in Glendive Montana.</p>
<p>DO NOT submit requests for plans and specifications to the site visit personnel listed above. See &lsquo;Obtaining Solicitation Documents' below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project Description: (Approx. quantities)<br /> <br />Construct a replacement irrigation diversion weir across the Lower Yellowstone River and fish bypass channel through Joe's Island. The weir consists of a steel W-pile section foundation with reinforced concrete crest structure capping it, and will be upstream of an existing wooden weir constructed in 1911-1912, with riprap placed between the weirs. Ninety-four W-pile sections are driven to a depth of approximately 37 feet. The weir length is approximately 700 linear feet and amount of formed reinforced concrete is approximately 500 cubic yards. The construction requires the use of sheet pile coffering and constructed in segments in order to not block the entire river.</p>
<p>Bypass channel will be approximately 2.2 miles long with ~75-foot bottom width, ~200-foot top width, ~18 feet average excavation depth with varying side slopes. The channel side slopes will be protected with a layer of riprap on bends, the invert and side slopes protected with cobbles processed from the excavation, and the entrance and exit and two locations within the channel protected with riprap structures. The channel excavation requires intense dewatering system to be designed by the Contractor, and earthen cofferdams at the channel entrance and exit.</p>
<p>Approximate quantities are as follows: ~980,000 CY of excavation, ~99,000 Tons of quarried riprap, and ~34,000 CY of cobbles for invert protection. Most of the excavation will be wasted on Joe's Island in an existing natural high-flow channel for a length of ~9000 feet.</p>
<p>Project will also require seeding and planting of trees and resurfacing an access road for approximately 6000 linear feet. Relocation of a historic wooden cableway tower and a building to new locations, and removal and coiling of cable that spans the river. The work scheduling will be affected by irrigation and fish passage dates.</p>
<p>The estimated construction cost of this project is between $40,000,000 and $50,000,000.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to commence work within 10 days after notice to proceed and complete the work 900 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed. Provisions will be included for liquidated damages in case of failure to complete the work in the time allowed. Performance and payment bonds will be required. Bonding documents including the power of attorney shall bear an original signature by an officer of the surety.</p>
<p>Bidders (Offerors):<br />Please be advised of on-line registration requirement for Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) is now located in System for Award Management (SAM) database https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.<br />Representations and certifications are required to be updated annually as a minimum to keep information current, accurate and complete. The electronic annual representations and certifications are effective until one year from date of submission or update to SAM</p>
<p>AMENDMENT #1</p>
<p>Due to the error in uploading the solicitation twice, Amendment #1 was to post the Yellowstone Drawings.  However, please be advised, this is a very large file and may take several minutes to upload.</p>

<DESC><strong>***AMENDMENT 0001***</strong><br />The purpose of this amendment is to post revised technical approach and evaluation criteria, post a revised list of provisions/clauses and post responses to contractor questions:<br /><br />Q1) What shall be the expected proportion of healing and non-healing dehisced wounds among the 90 enrolled patients?<br />A1) The Government expects approximately 4% from each wound category (trauma, abdominal wounds, etc.) become dehisced wounds<br /><br />Q2) For 16S/ITS sequencing, does the number of reads required (100,000) refer to single or paired end reads? In other words, is the expected sequencing output 30 or 60 Mbp per sample?<br />A2) The Government requires paired-end sequencing workflow, each producing 100,000 reads per end per sample (200,000 total).<br /><br />Q3) For WGS metagenomics sequencing, does the number of reads required (200 millions) refer to single or paired end reads? In other words, is the expected sequencing output 30 or 60 Gbp per sample?<br />A3) It refers to paired-end sequencing workflow, each producing 200 million reads per end per sample (200,000 total).<br /><br />Q4) When does the project start if funded?<br />A4) The project will start once the contract is awarded.<br /><br />Q5) Is there any guidance on what body parts and cause of wounds are eligible or preferred, that is skin vs muscle, leg vs abdomen, trauma such as gunshot wound or car accidents, general surgery, diabetic foot, etc.?<br />A5) If possible, the Government seeks a statistically sufficient amount of wounds per wound category (e.g., trauma, skin wounds, abdominal wounds, general surgical wounds). Currently, there are no restrictions to the type of wound injury; however, patients who are under 18, patients who are immunocompromised, and patients exhibiting chronic wounds and ulcers (e.g., diabetic foot) that are not from post-surgery would be restricted.<br /><br />Q6) With regard to the Non-Disclosure Agreement document (2.W81XWH18R0069_NDA.DOC), which official shall be indicated as the "Task Manager or higher"?<br />A6) The contractor shall name a person who will be the main Point of Contact (POC) between the Government and their organization. This POC can be a program manager or a higher level in the contractor's organizational structure.<br /><br />Q7) Is there an incumbent, and if so, what is the contract number?<br />A7) This is a new requirement and there is no incumbent.<br /><br />See Revised Combined Synopsis Solicitation details and Provisions and Clauses documents for full details of solicitation changes.<br /><br /><strong>***END AMENDMENT***<br /></strong><br /><br />This is an unrestricted combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 - Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

<DESC>BATTLEFIELD CONNECTED, CUMULATIVE, AND CONVERGENT<br />SUPPORT SERVICES (BC3SS)
<p>AMENDMENT 0001: The purpose of this amendment is to revise the BC3SS Industry Day event registration link. Interested parties should register at https://www.arl.army.mil/bc3ss. <br />There are no other changes taking place as a result of this amendment.</p>
<p>Sources Sought Notice for Battlefield Connected, Cumulative, and Convergent Support Services (BC3SS)</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION: No award will be made as a result of this request. This Sources Sought Notice is for informational purposes only. The Government is not obligated to make an award as a result of this request. This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB), a Request for Proposal (RFP), or Request for Quotation (RFQ). No solicitation document exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this Sources Sought Announcement. Not responding to this Sources Sought Notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government will not reimburse costs incurred by respondents in response to this SS, or for participating in information exchange regarding details of the SS. Only U.S. citizens and U.S. owned firms can respond to this SS.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The Army Research Laboratory is surveying the market to locate/identify interested Small Business Concerns to support the technology development to meet the Army's Research and Technology Requirements. BC3SS is anticipated to be a Multi-Award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (MA-IDIQ) type contract that is planned to provide task orders which will primarily be issued on a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) basis. BC3SS is anticipated to have a five (5) year base ordering period. It is not feasible at this time to describe in detail, each individual task the Contractor will be required to perform. This procurement will enable ARL's ability to perform its mission of research, development and experimentation. The Army Modernization Priorities are the critical needs of the Army to maintain overmatch for the Soldier as we anticipate the demands of future conflict. ARL's Essential Research Programs (ERPs) focus our efforts to pursue the Army's vision of the Multi-Domain Battle with the intent to operate each ERP as a program with well-defined outcomes and decision points. Long-term Science and Technology (S&amp;T) trajectories for the ERPs are focused on outcomes that provide overmatch for the Army with an eye to providing capabilities in the 2050 time frame - without the luxury of time. ARL requires an agile and entrepreneurial mindset and be expeditious in transition of research products to RDEC's, industry, Program Managers (PM)/Program Executive Offices (PEO), and the requirements community as soon as they show promise. ARL and our industry partners must be aligned and ready to support the Cross Functional Teams (CFTs) in the pursuit of mid- and far-term capabilities.</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Battlefield Connected, Cumulative, and Convergent Support Services (BC3SS) contract is intended to support the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) and its customers in the performance of their Research and Development (R&amp;D) mission to organize and deliver critical capabilities to our combat formations. ARL must develop technological advancements that outpace our adversaries and deliver superiority to our forces to fight and win wars. ARL will accomplish this through the alignment of research programs and resources to address the Army's Modernization Command priorities to organize and deliver modern, critical capabilities to our combat forces. The Army Modernization technical outcomes aim to achieve overmatch against our adversaries, whenever and wherever we deploy our forces. The technical outcomes, organized to deliver to the Army Futures Command, Cross Functional Teams, include the development of longer range precision fires; next generation ground combat vehicles; future vertical lift capabilities; advances in soldier lethality; assured, precision position, navigation, and timing, especially in Global Positioning System (GPS) denied environments; advanced networks and command, control, computing and intelligence systems; advanced air and missile defense systems; and synthetic training environments. ARL's R&amp;D mission must be CONNECTED across the Future Force Modernization Enterprise (FFME), the Army, Department of Defense (DoD) organizations and other customers, transition partners, and to our industrial and academic partners. This will be done through high quality products delivered to the Army and our Soldiers in the shortest time possible.  ARL's work must be CUMULATIVE - building upon existing technology and best practices. ARL must make effective use of the Army research enterprise and provide excellent stewardship of resources. This requires our workforce and industry partners to be well-connected to their technical communities and knowledgeable about what currently constitutes the state-of-the-art in their technical fields. It also requires that our efforts build from basic and applied research through development to prototyping of novel capabilities. The goal is that our cumulative efforts are greater than just the sum of their constituent parts and must CONVERGE to deliver results and products that meet the Army Modernization Priorities.</p>
<p>The services to be provided by the Contractor, as outlined below will require facilities and  personnel with scientific, engineering, analytical, computer programming, manufacturing/pre-production, administrative, management, facilities support and various other technical skills; the ability to fabricate hardware and software prototypes; the ability to purchase specific existing technologies, host platforms and equipment and the ability to integrate that equipment into various hardware and software prototypes; the ability to demonstrate new concepts; the expertise to perform computer modeling and simulation experiments; and the capability for supporting diverse laboratory and field testing. The BC3SS will require scientific, engineering, and business operations support services in the following eight (8) emphasis areas:</p>
<p>1.	Advanced Electro-Optic Sensors and Photonics - The emphasis in this area is the development of the next generation of optical sensors from the ultraviolet through the infrared for both active and passive sensing systems. The work also emphasizes advanced materials and the application of integrated photonics technologies for advanced sensors and systems.</p>
<p>2.	Advanced Electronics and Radio Frequency (RF) Technologies - The emphasis is in the application of RF technologies to address Army needs in imaging, targeting and detection of targets, Information, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4), electronic warfare and various aspects of intelligence gathering through the use of RF devices and systems. This includes development of antennas, especially conformal antenna technology, Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) and modeling of these devices and systems. It also involves development of micro- and nano-scale devices and fabrication techniques.</p>
<p>3.	Power Sources, Systems and Materials - This area addresses power and energy technologies ranging from individual Soldier power to power conversion and conditioning technologies for vehicles.  It is driven by the need for more efficient and lightweight power to provide Tactical Unit Energy Independence.</p>
<p>4.	Information Science for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) - As sensors and sensor systems proliferate in the operating environment, it is critical to develop methods, algorithms, and systems to convert the data from the sensors into useful, actionable information. This area emphasizes on both the development of sensor systems (acoustic, seismic, electric field, magnetic field and imaging) and the systems required to provide useful, actionable intelligence from them. Ideally, the analysis and information process can be incorporated into the sensor systems, rather than having to transmit the data to a central hub for analysis.</p>
<p>5.	Micro-Autonomous Systems and Technology - The challenges involved in developing small-scale robotics, especially micro-scale autonomous systems, are of vital interest to ARL in order to provide these capabilities to the lowest echelons of our forces in the field.  This area emphasizes on addressing those challenges in order to develop micro-scale crawling and flying autonomous systems. It involves providing power to these systems and especially addressing challenges in thermal management on micro-scale systems through modeling, the development of design tools, experimentation and analysis.</p>
<p>6.	Discovery (Basic Research) - As the Army's corporate laboratory, ARL is concerned with basic and applied research in order to prepare the Army for the challenges of the future.  Several areas of interest in the basic research program are the development of non-medical biotechnology, quantum technology and novel materials research. Non-medical biotechnology is being examined for areas such as waste-to-energy conversion and on the spot manufacture of commodity chemicals to reduce the logistics trail of our forces.  Quantum technologies can potentially provide advanced sensors for locating buried objects, Assured Position, Navigation and Timing capabilities, and secure networks for communications and data transfer.</p>
<p>7.	Advanced Concepts and Technical Prototyping - As ARL emphasis's on developing novel technologies, opportunities will arise to rapidly spin some of those technologies out as proof of concepts or novel prototypes for testing in relevant environments. ARL requires partners to assist in the modeling, design, fabrication, and testing of these concepts and prototypes in short time frames to meet our requirements.</p>
<p>8.	Computer modeling and simulation - Underpinning all of the work described above is physics-based modeling and simulation. The effort involves both the development of the models and their use in guiding experimental efforts. These efforts run the gamut from biological systems models to semiconductor materials modeling to simulations of RF systems.</p>
<p><br />HISTORTICAL EFFORTS:</p>
<p>Please reference "Historical Efforts" attachment for additional background information pertaining to the current efforts in place at ARL. Please note that the referenced attachment is solely a representation of existing Contractor support requirements, however, it is does not encompass all anticipated requirements of ARL under the new BC3SS effort, which are clearly captured in the eight (8) emphasis areas listed above.</p>

Based on the assembly, it appears that to accept the screws, these would be .500 x 13 threaded holes, but other than the one through hole, there is no indication for thread depth, other than they need to be deep enough to accept their portion of the 1.5" screw.&nbsp;<br /><br />As this is part of the testing fixture, I understand that it may not be overly critical, however with the stress the fixture will be under, I would like to ensure that the part is built as designed to ensure test conformity.<br /><br />A:&nbsp;&nbsp;All holes on F/N 8 should be .500-13UNC-2B with .75 min thread depth IAW <span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">FED-STD-H28/2.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also F/N 7 is 1.00 Thick STK.</span></p>

<p>HOW TO OFFER: The Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov, will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government in response to RLP 18-REGXX.  In addition, the Government will use its AAAP to satisfy the above space requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during any "Open Period".</p>
<p>The Open Period is the Xst through the Xth of each month, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST. Refer to AAAP RLP paragraph 3.02.A for more details on the offer submission process. The Government reserves the right to allow for multiple Open Periods prior to selecting an offer for award to meet this specific space requirement.  Offers cannot be submitted during the Closed Period (Xst/th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.</p>
<p>This FBO advertisement is hereby incorporated into the RLP 18-REGXX by way of reference as an RLP attachment.</p>
<p>Lease award will be made to the lowest price, technically acceptable offer, without negotiations, based upon the requirements in this FBO advertisement and in the RLP requirements package found on the AAAP website.  During an Open Period, offerors will be permitted to submit new offers or modify existing offers.  Offerors can draft an offer at any time; however, you can only submit an offer during the Open Period.</p>
<p>The offered space must comply with the requirements in this FBO advertisement and RLP 18-REGXX and must meet Federal Government, State, and Local jurisdiction requirements, including requirements for fire and life safety, security, accessibility, seismic, energy, and sustainability standards in accordance with the terms of the Lease.  The Lease and all documents that constitute the Lease package can be found at https://aaap.gsa.gov.</p>
<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<DESC><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transportation Security Administration (TSA)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Request for Information (RFI)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Land Mobile Radio Handheld and Infrastructure Replacement Project</p>
<p>**&nbsp;TSA updated question 5 to remove "Vendor Questions Template" and&nbsp;corrected the date&nbsp;to reflect, Tuesday, October 30,2018**</p>
<p><br />I. Disclaimer:</p>
<p>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) for the purposes of determining market capability of sources and obtaining additional information. It does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quote (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services discussed in this notice. Any formal solicitation that may subsequently be issued will be announced separately. Information on the specific topics of interest is provided in the following sections of this announcement. Neither TSA nor any other part of the Federal Government will be responsible for any cost incurred by responders in furnishing this information.</p>
<p>II. Background:</p>
<p>This RFI pertains to the TSA requirements within the United States of America and it territories for transitioning the TSA Land Mobile Radio System from the VHF (Very High Frequency) to UHF (Ultra High Frequency) frequency range. TSA will be responsible for obtaining all frequencies and coordinating with the FAA for permits for the new UHF frequencies. <br />At the present time, TSA operates approximately 155 repeaters at approximately 150 airports, approximately 120 base stations at approximately at 120 airports, and over 21,000 handheld radios at approximately 415 airports located in the United States of America and its territories. TSA also has Bi-directional amplifier (BDA) and Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) systems installed at approximately 10 airports. Currently TSA manually encrypts its handheld radios and base stations monthly.</p>
<p>III. Handheld Radios:</p>
<p>TSA radio users are located in all 50 States, and US Territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands). TSA voice and data service requirements routinely change as airports are federalized or de-federalized increasing and decreasing the number of locations supported. TSA intends to replace the VHF handhelds with UHF handhelds. TSA seeks handhelds that are rugged and fit for purpose.</p>
<p>Specific questions concerning the handheld radios and handheld maintenance are included in Attachment 3-A.<br /><br /><br />IV. Infrastructure:</p>
<p>The TSA infrastructure is not on a shared networked; each airport has it's only stand-alone system. All repeater and a majority of the base stations have antennas mounted on the roof of an airport terminal. TSA is intending to replace existing infrastructure with equipment that can both perform as currently functioning and potentially be used to improve TSA radio capability going forward.</p>
<p>- A repeater is defined as the transmitter, receiver, duplexer, transmission line, antenna, and associated grounding equipment. <br />- A base station is defined as the base station, paddle mic, transmission line, and antenna.<br /><br />Specific questions concerning Infrastructure are included in Attachment 3 -B.</p>
<p>V. Encryption:</p>
<p>TSA presently manually encrypts all handhelds and base stations on monthly basis utilizing Motorola KVL4000s. The new keys are generated locally and TSA has no requirement for a single nationwide key. TSA is interested in proposals for less labor intensive, but still cost effective way of changing keys monthly.<br /><br />Specific questions concerning Encryption are included in Attachment 3- C.</p>
<p>VI. Purpose:</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to solicit statements of interest, conduct market research, as well as obtain industry recommendations to further inform TSA of industry best practices and vendor capabilities as it relates to UHF radios and UHF infrastructure equipment and services. TSA is currently planning to transition from the current VHF Land Mobile Radio (LMR) equipment to UHF LMR equipment using a 5-year phased approach. The intent of this RFI is to conduct market research for TSA's transition to UHF LMR System or future LMR contract(s) specifically to:</p>
<p>a. Procurement:</p>
<p>i. TSA presently has over 21,000 LMR that requires lifecycle refresh. How much of the existing inventory could be reused by others? What determination would industry use to determine what existing LMR assets will be bought back? How would you recommend that be accomplished?</p>
<p>b. Operations/Performance:</p>
<p>i. How would you propose to provide failure rate guarantees?<br />ii. How would industry propose to provide service level guarantees with maintenance?<br />iii. How often should the radios be life cycled?<br />iv. Please provide industry insight and recommendations to ensure a smooth and successful transition of radio services; i.e. maintaining current service levels with minimal disruption during the transition;<br />v. Please provide industry input as to the most cost-effective procedures for break-fix and preventive maintenance of the UHF infrastructure<br />vi. Please provide recommendations on the most cost-effective method to utilize equipment removed from service as spare parts for similar equipment remaining in service.<br />vii. Please identify options from industry as to disposition of equipment removed from service. (Trade-in, reserve for spares, reserve for spares and then trade-in, etc.)<br />viii. TSA will welcome recommended solutions for less labor intensive methods to re-key 21,000+ handheld radios and 117 base stations on a monthly basis.<br />ix. The change out of infrastructure is a major project. How would you oversee/manage a project of this size? <br />x. How would you handle the ongoing support of codeplugs (new, existing) throughout the duration of the contract?<br />xi. How would you perform site-surveys for base stations, repeaters, and BDA/DAS systems?<br />xii. How would you dispatch personnel to address issues on-site? Where would these personnel be dispatched from?<br />xiii. Do you support the use of aftermarket non-OEM accessories with your radios? Provide the manufactures name and the type of accessories that has been deem compatible for usage with your brand of radios? <br />xiv. TSA is requesting information concerning the advantage of purchasing the extended warranty on repeaters, base stations, and handhelds. TSA is considering requesting successful Contractor furnish a Help Desk that receives trouble calls, triages the problem, and takes action to resolve the problem. If it is a handheld failure, the Help Desk will arrange shipping the defective unit to the Help Desk where it would be repaired or replaced and shipped back to the airport. What would be the advantage/disadvantage to the government if the handheld is under warranty or not. Should there be a CLIN for repairing radios under warranty and a separate CLIN for repairing radios not under warranty? The planned SOW will require the successful Contractor to travel to the airports to repair a defective base station or repeater. What would be the advantage/disadvantage to the government if the repeater or base station is under warranty or not?</p>
<p><br />c. General:</p>
<p>What information is required from TSA in order to submit a comprehensive proposal should TSA proceed with the RFP stage?</p>
<p>VII. Intent:</p>
<p>TSA intends to use the information obtained from your responses to assess viable and innovative technical approaches to maintain continuity of service and minimize costs while transitioning from a VHF to UHF LMR infrastructure. A favorable market survey will be followed by the development and execution of a supporting acquisition strategy. The specific timeframe for execution will be determined once quality responses to this RFI and viability of market offerings in this area are confirmed.</p>

JUSTIFICATION  FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                          Office of Procurement, Acquisition and Logistics
      Technology Acquisition Center
      23 Christopher Way
      Eatontown, New Jersey 07724
      
2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a firm-fixed price delivery order
issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) for seven brand name DSS, Inc.(DSS) TeleCare Record Manager (TRM) Plus and DSS Triage Expert Dual Purpose Tier 3 (TEDP-Tier 3) software licenses and support renewals for Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 21.  

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  The proposed software renewal will provide VISN 21 with continued use of its existing TRM Plus and TEDP-Tier 3 software licenses and support, which are highly specialized software applications used by VISN 21 Telecare staff to provide telephone triage and informational services to Veterans, thereby allowing VA to comply with Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Directive 2007-033 for 24/7 access to medical advice.  TRM Plus is a complete telephone liaison care management software solution that provides access to telephone treatment protocols to update and organize information from different categories of patient calls.  TEDP-Tier 3 is a clinical software application used by nurses who provide telephone triage services to Veterans.  TEDP-Tier 3  supports nurse clinical decision making by systematically assessing a Veteran's symptoms through the use of electronic algorithms with branching clinical logic, while providing reference health education information via a clinical library during the process.  TEDP-Tier 3 allows the nursing triage staff to identify emergencies, and reduces unnecessary clinic visits.  This information is then integrated with the patient s actual health record.  

Additionally, the telephone triage system provides the support described and also includes a series of VA designed business rules which vary by clinical department and are applied during each triage encounter.  There are also national business rules incorporated into the TRM Plus Software.  Business rules are developed nationally for the telephone triage product and apply to all VA medical facilities.  After beta testing several years ago, it was determined that these products would be used nationally by VHA medical facilities.  VHA has integrated this software into both its computer hardware and clinical software environments.  Both Vista and Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) reside on the currently fielded triage systems. Documentation is automatically created in the background during the triage process and saved as a triage encounter record.  The proposed effort shall also provide support for TRM Plus and TEDP-Tier 3 during the 12-month period of performance to ensure the software remains operational. This support includes patches, bug fixes and maintenance that will require a source to have access to both brands of software.  The required software licenses and support are sold exclusively through DSS, or one of its authorized resellers. The total estimated price of this proposed action is $.  The period of performance is from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019 with two 12-month option periods.
                        
4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B) entitled,  Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized. 

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Based upon continued market research, as described in section 8 of this document, it is determined that limited competition is available among authorized resellers of TRM Plus and TEDP Tier 3 software license and support renewals.  TRM Plus and TEDP Tier 3 software has been used within VISN 21 since 2008.  The TRM Plus and TEPD-Tier 3 software are the only software applications that meets all of VA s interoperability and compatibility requirements.  Specifically, both TRM Plus and TEDP-Tier 3 software are enhanced base-line commercial-off-the-shelf software products that VA information technology staff and VHA clinical staff have used to provide a custom VHA nursing telephone liaison care management system commonly referred to in the VHA as VHA Clinical Nursing Telephone Triage System.  This VHA Clinical Nursing Telephone Triage System is installed at the VISN level and serves seven Health Care Systems within VISN 21: Palo Alto, San Francisco, Central Califonia (Fresno), Northern California (Sacramento), Sierra Nevada (Reno), Pacific Islands (Honolulu) and Southern Nevada (Las Vegas).  TRM Plus and TEDP-Tier 3 software permits the user to access administrative and clinical information in the Veteran medical record known as the CPRS while launching the TEDP-Tier 3 application should clinical algorithms be needed to evaluate the Veteran caller.  TRM Plus and TEDP-Tier 3 software are the only clinical software applications that have the ability to interface with both VistA and CPRS and meet VA s interoperability and compatibility requirements.  VistA and CPRS are currently only coded to work with TRM Plus and TEDP-Tier 3 software which are embedded together.  Use of any other software would result in duplicated efforts to recode and reconfigure the existing triage systems that use VistA and CPRS.  This would result in extensive delivery delays of at least two years and duplicative costs of at least $1M that could not be recuperated through competition.  These estimates are based on both similar efforts and failed attempts by other sources to provide an interface with both VistA and CPRS.  The TRM Plus and TEDP-Tier 3 software licenses are already fully integrated into the VistA CPRS system utilizing this software.  Having software that integrates with VistA and CPRS is critical so clinicians can access and evaluate a patients medical records during the triage process.  Failure to access patient records would result in incomplete information with which to advise the patient. 

VA has many years invested in the customization of the TRM Plus and TEDP-Tier 3 software licenses to meet the current and ongoing architecture needs of VA.  To work with another manufacturer s product to achieve the current level of functionality of this software would require extensive rework and high level programing along with system design expertise to customize and retrofit another software product to meet the needs currently met by the existing software products which have been used for many years.  To date, VA has not identified any other vendors who can successfully integrate their software with VistA and CPRS.  In addition, TRM Plus and TEPD-Tier 3 are proprietary software products owned by DSS. Inc; therefore, support for for these products can only be provided by DSS, or one of their authorized resellers. Only these sources have access to the proprietary code needed to support the TRM Plus and TEDP-Tier 3 software licenses and ensure all services provided are properly configured. 

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:   Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D) the resulting contract award will be announced on the Federal Business Opportunities Page and this Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity will be made publicly available.  In addition, this Justification for an Exception to Fair Opportunity will be posted on the NASA SEWP V website with the solicitation.  

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the Government will continue to perform market research to determine if there are any new products or maintenance services available that will enable future requirements to be competed.

8.  Market Research:  The Government s technical experts have conducted research using internet searches looking for alternative software products with compatible electronic triage protocols that could be readily integrated with VistA and CPRS. VA s technical experts reviewed similar software from Microsoft to include the product description and previous efforts to try and interface this product with VistA and CPRS, which failed. It was determined, as of June 2018, that the dual products of TRM Plus and TEDP-Tier 3 are the only software products that can meet VA s specified healthcare requirements that permit full and seamless integration with VistA and CPRS without significant development, configuration and associated testing duplicating what VA has already completed and invested in as detailed in Section 5 of this Justification.  

In July 2018, the Contract Specialist conducted market research to ascertain the extent of limited competition among resellers of the required software licenses and support renewals.  Through the use of the Provider Look-up tool on the NASA SEWP V GWAC website, one Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) and two small businesses were identified as resellers of the required Telecare Record Manger license renewals and support.  Additionally, the Contract Specialist reached out to DSS, Inc. via phone to confirm there are no other SDVOSB resllers of these DSS products and support.  A representative from DSS, confirmed for the Contract Specialist that Minburn Technology was the only SDVOSB reseller of the TRM and TEDP-Tier 3 software and support.  Further, DSS, Inc. confirmed that small business resellers GMC Tek and Sword and Shield were resellers of the products as well.  Therefore, limited competition is anticipated.

9.  Other Facts:  None.




10.  Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

JUSTIFICATION FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY

1.  Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
                                          Office of Procurement, Acquisition and Logistics
      Technology Acquisition Center
      23 Christopher Way
      Eatontown, New Jersey 07724
              
2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a firm-fixed-price delivery order issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC), for the renewal of brand name Liferay Digital Experience Platform (DXP) Enterprise Subscription Platinum Level Software licenses and maintenance support.  

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  VA Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), Enterprise Program Management Office (EPMO), has a requirement for the renewal of three Non-Production and 12 Production Liferay DXP Enterprise Subscription Platinum Level Software licenses and maintenance support.  An additional 14 Non-Production Liferay DXP Enterprise Subscription Platinum Level Software licenses and maintenance support are also required.  The Liferay software licenses are currently being utilized as the user interface of the My HealtheVet (MHV) platform.  With the entire MHV web based portal running on Liferay, it is critical that OI&T EPMO MHV teams have access to technical support necessary to support the system.  The renewal of Liferay licenses and maintenance support will allow non-technical Veterans Health Administration staff to continue to manage website content updates without intervention from the EPMO staff.  Additionally, the software maintenance will provide bug fixes and updates that are required to keep the software operational to mitigate security vulnerabilities.  The period of performance is 12 months from October 3, 2018 through October 2, 2019 with three12-month option periods and optional tasks for an additional one Non-Production and three Production Liferay DXP Enterprise Subscription Platinum Level Software licenses and maintenance support has been included for each option period. The total estimated price of the proposed action, inclusive of all options and optional tasks, is $ 
                        
4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting this exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(2) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B) entitled,  Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized. 

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  Based on market research, as described in section 8 of this document, it has been determined that limited competition for Liferay DXP Enterprise Subscription software and support is viable among authorized resellers of these products. The current MHV platform utilizes Liferay licenses for its user interface.  This user interface integrates with the currently fielded MHV platform, which has 26 distinct applications, such as Appointments, Pharmacy, Blue Button, and the Healthy Living Assessment.  Liferay has been integrated with each of these MHV capabilities.  If any other brand name software was to be utilized as the user interface for the MHV platform, then all 26 applications would require integration with the new software.  All of the current applications are coded to specifically interact with Liferay source code.  Any integration of a different software solution would result in the inability to access MHV for at least 1.5 years.  The reengineered MHV platform is built on Liferay and if another platfrom would be implemented, it would have to be rewritten, tested, deployed as well as stop all of the current Legacy work that is currently ongoing to move onto the Liferay platform.  This would result in extensive delivery delays of up to two years and $4.4M in costs that would not be recovered through competition.  These estimates are based on previous efforts for similar procurements.  This would severely impact million Veterans as MHV is the Veteran s sole resource for virtual healthcare from VA.  Veterans would lose the ability to virtually access their personal health information, virtually contact their physicians, access thier appointment information, and virtually refill vital medications, among all the other capabilities that MHV currently provides.  
 
Additionally, since Liferay software is proprietary, no other vendor can provide the required software maintenance and technical support.  In order to continue to correct bugs or remediate security vulnerabilities in any existing/ new software, access to the source code is required.  No other vendor, other than the software developer, has access to this source code.  Furthermore, for this reason, no other vendors offer technical support for the product that VA can utilize to allow non-technical VHA staff to continue to manage website content updates without intervention from the EPMO staff.  Other software developers that offer similar products merely provide software maintenance and technical support for their own proprietary software products.      

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:   Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this justification.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), award of the resultant delivery order will be synopsized and this justification will be made publicly available on the Federal Business Opportunities Page within 14 days of award.  In accordance with FAR 16.505(a)(4)(iii)(A), the justification will be posted with the request for quote on the NASA SEWP V GWAC website with the solicitation to notify all interested parties.

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the Government will continue to perform market research to determine if there are any new products or maintenance services available that will fulfill the Government s need.

8.  Market Research:  Market research was conducted in August 2018 by the Government s technical experts.  The team searched content management products Alfresco, Drupal 8.0, and Team site.  The Government s technical experts determined that none of the products will meet the Government s requirements due to interoperability and compatibility issues as outlined in section 5 of this justification.  While these software developers provide products that perform similar functions, selecting an alternate product would require a significant redesign to the MHV portal.  Additionally, these vendors only offer software maintenance and technical support for their own proprietary products.  Market research has concluded that Liferay is the only software product, and its associated software maintenance and technical support, that meets all of the needs of the Government.  

In August 2018, the Contract Specialist conducted market research to ascertain the extent of limited competition among resellers of the required software licenses and associated software maintenance.  Through the use of the Provider Look-up tool on the NASA SEWP V GWAC website, 10 Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) were identified as resellers of the required Liferay Software licenses and maintenance support.  Therefore, limited competition is anticipated.

<DESC><p>Extended warranty for parts and services for the MARK 20A Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) at: Ramstein Air Base - Northern and Southern runways and Spangdahlem Air Base runways. The MARK 20A systems were initially purchased from Thales ATM Inc, who is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Thales systems in Germany are supported by Thales Deutschland GmbH.</p>
<p>There is no other source except Thales Deutschland GmbH that warranties critical replacement parts and provides technical services for the MARK 20A ILS. OEM replacement parts and trained Thales technicians are vital to safe airfield equipment operation. Market research unveiled no other warranty provider for MARK 20A replacement parts or warranty services. Warranty provided by another provider would be incompatible with the system and impose unacceptable variations in critical flight safety parameters established by the Federal Aviation Agency. No comparisons are found for these unique replacement parts. Service from other vendors purchasing Thales replacement parts could create artificial price inflation.</p>

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   
This service is for an EZ Care SimplexGrinnell Nurse Call System maintenance.  The system uses a Certified Life-Safety software program, which was specifically designed by SimplexGrinnell for it s EZCare Systems.  This means that there is no educational material commercially available from which a non-SimplexGrinnell technician can qualify to field edit the program or operate the keyboard, as required, to test or service the Central Processing Unit and it s integrated control panels.  This system requires a servicing technician to be trained on the product, and to be able to program and receive any required technical support from a factory trained tech support specialist.  The SimplexGrinnell System is composed of specially designed printed circuit boards.  All boards required for the operation of the Life-Saftey system are stocked in the SimplexGrinnell Richmond Branch Office for use, as required, by SimplexGrinnell technicians.  All boards are manufactured by SimplexGrinnell and are not commercially available from an electronic supply house.  Servicing of the basic system would generally require the immediate replacement of one or more of these printed boards in order to put the system back on line. Any other vendor would have to order the parts from the SimplexGrinnell factory, causing unacceptable delays. Specific parts that are proprietary to SimplexGrinnell include:
  Software liability release forms (Only releasable by owner)
  EZCare SimplexGrinnell manufactured printed circuit boards 
  Factory trained technicians
  Regional and factory service support organization
  Updating and modifications to the system performed by the OEM
  Availability of internal wiring diagrams for trouble-shooting the system
The system parts are only available through SimplexGrinnell and can only be serviced by SimplexGrinnell technicians that have been factory trained, to maintain system integrity and any applicable warranties.  
Any other vendor would have to subcontract with SimplexGrinnell to provide this specialized service, which would result in a substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition, and result in unacceptable delays.  In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), this requirement is only available from one responsible source.


Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  
A previous acquisition attempt for Fiscal Year 2018 was made to compete the requirement as an SDVOSB set-aside. VA246-17-Q-1981 was issued on 11/07/2017, and was dissolved without award due to a determination of not producing any fair and reasonable offers.  Market research was performed that identified 2 Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses interested in providing the requirement, through subcontracting with the OEM.  The solicitation yielded one offer.  The offer received was substantially higher than the Independent Government Cost Estimate.  Further market research did not identify any other small businesses interested in subcontracting with the OEM to provide the service.  The requirement was re-solicited as an Open Market Sole Source procurement to the OEM, SimplexGrinnell.  The Fiscal Year 2018 requirement was awarded to SimplexGrinnell, LP as an open market sole source procurement, resulting in contract 36C24618P1406.  An Intent to Sole Source was posted to www.fbo.gov on July 10, 2018, which yielded no responses.  


Determination by the CO that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  
In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(2), the Contracting Officer anticipates the cost will be fair and reasonable based on previous history with this vendor providing the same service.  The vendor is well aware of the service requirements, and has a history of providing fair and reasonable prices.


Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
Previous Market Research was reviewed which revealed the dissolvement of an SDVOSB set-aside, Request for Quotation VA246-17-Q-1981, without award due to not producing a fair and reasonable offer.  All previous acquisitions ended in a sole source procurement with the OEM, SimplexGrinnell, LP.  After review of the procurement history, market research was performed for the current acquisition. The Vendor Information Pages (VIP) database was searched in accordance with VAAR Class Deviation 810.001-70 to determine if two or more service-disabled veteran-owned businesses (SDVOSBs) and veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs), in the appropriate NAICS code, were available. No requests for information or capabilities were sent directly to any vendors found.  An Intent to Sole Source was posted to www.fbo.gov on July 10, 2018, providing vendors with an opportunity to submit capabilities for this service until July 18, 2018. None were received.  

Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  None.

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None. 

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  
Due to the proprietary nature of the equipment being service, the only way competition would be available is by a vendor subcontracting with the OEM.  This could result in a substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition, and could also result in unacceptable delays.  The SDVOSB set-aside indicated the substantial cost increase, and delayed award of the fiscal year 2018 requirement.  There are no known strategies to overcome the barriers to competition for this requirement at this time.  

Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Acquisition Plan Action ID: 36C248-18-AP-3462

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 08, James A. Haley Veterans
Hospital (JAHVH) located at 13000 Bruce B. Downs Blvd. Tampa, FL 33612. 673-19-1-023-0014.

Description of Action: EMERGENCY bridge order to continue existing Urinalysis testing/analyzers to prevent disruption in direct patient care. The Cost Per Reportable Result (CPRR) contract for existing equipment at the lab FSS contract V797P-7090A expired and the last option year cannot be exercised against internal IDIQ contract V797P-7090A VA248-15-F-2583. This is a one-time Emergency. The estimated value of the proposed action is $225,909.14.

Order against:     FSS Contract Number: V797D-70260 new contract expires 10/05/2022 

Name of Proposed Contractor:
Beckman Coulter
Street Address:
250 South Kramer Boulevard
City, State, Zip:
Brea CA 92821-6232
Phone:

Description of Supplies or Services: This is an EMERGENCY request to continue existing CPRR supplies of two (2) Iris IQ 200 Sprint / iChem Velocity Automated Urinalysis Systems to the JAHVH and one (1) Iris IQ 200 Elite / iChem Velocity to the New Port Richey Outpatient Clinic. The CPRR program includes all instrumentation and service, implementation costs, patient controls, calibrators, repeat tests, reagents, consumables (urine chemistries tests, urine microscopies, chemistries and microscopies overage), controls, printers, spare parts, and 24/7 service. System handles high volume workloads with short turnaround times, at least 200 samples per hour, and shall deliver well established, standout performance on proficiency surveys. System should eliminate manual microscopy and should provide state of the art digital images and auto-particle recognition software that provides the most extensive and accurate quantification of urine particles, rigorously tested and accurate chemistry assays. 

This is unusual compelling situation to continue the CPRR program for urinalysis to allow for a competitive Base plus Four Year Options. The urgent need is that the lab equipment is required to run tests continually to meet the demand of the lab and the VA must continue service because any interruption could result in serious injury and the wellbeing of patients. A one-year bridge order for a Period of Performance 1 October 2018 to 30 September 2019 is necessary to avoid interruption of inpatient care and liability to the VA. Beckman Coulter offers the CPRR program and there are no Service Disabled Veteran Owned/Veteran Owned/Small Business resellers/authorized providers. Items covered under Beckman Coulter new FSS contract V797D-70260 expires 10/05/2022.

Authority: 

ORDER AGAINST FSS:  Authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 USC 251, et seq.); Title 40 USC 501, Services for Executive Agencies; and Section 803 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2002 (PL 107-107) and implemented by FAR 8.405-6.  Mark the applicable exception:

  An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays(FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A);

  Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B));

  In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order and the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not previously issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C)); or

  Items peculiar to one manufacturer. An item peculiar to one manufacturer can be a particular brand name, product, or a feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer). A brand name item, whether available on one or more schedule contracts, is an item peculiar to one manufacturer (FAR 8.405-6(b)).

Rational/explanation to support cited authority: An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the sole source/logical follow on procedures would result in unacceptable delays. Due to time constraints, cost associated in changing vendors and the fact that we cannot award a new long-term contract by 1 October 2018, this emergency order will be placed to prevent a break in service. CO will conduct a competitive Base and Four-Year Option acquisition in FY19.

Note that this determination satisfies the requirements of FAR 8.405-6.  The requirement to prepare a written justification IAW FAR 6.303 does not apply to Federal Supply Schedules.
