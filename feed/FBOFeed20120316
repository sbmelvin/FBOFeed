This requirement will provide EOD support Air Force (AF) wide both CONUS and OCONUS. The EOD Support Services requirement ensures each EOD flight maintains accountability of munitions and explosives, documents required training and maintains explosive demolition equipment in serviceable and ready condition. This effort will free AF EOD personnel to respond to explosive incidents and concentrate on sharpening those skills that are critical to combating the improvised explosive devices, and maintaining nuclear weapons proficiency.
<p>The government will utilize the Tradeoff technique documented at MP 5315 AFFARS Library/Section M Templates/Approach #3 - Evaluate Technical, Rank by Price, Assess Performance until Proposal rated Substantial Confidence or all offers are evaluated. This technique is a simplified method that permits a tradeoff between price and performance in reaching the contract award decision. The government will award a contract resulting from this RFP to the contractor whose offer conforms to the RFP requirements, is considered technically acceptable, achieves a substantial past performance rating and will provide the best value to the government. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. If no offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment then the Source Selection Authority shall then make an integrated assessment best value award decision and reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest price offeror with a "Satisfactory Confidence" performance assessment. <br /><br />This requirement will be set aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business as it is anticipated that offers will be received from two or more Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses.<br />The period of performance is as follows: <br /><br />Base Period 01 Jan 2013 - 31 Dec 2013<br />Option Period 1 01 Jan 2014 - 31 Dec 2014<br />Option Period 2 01 Jan 2015 - 31 Dec 2015<br />Option Period 3 01 Jan 2016 - 31 Dec 2016<br />Option Period 4 01 Jan 2017 - 31 Dec 2017</p>

<DESC>The NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA) intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) on works and services within the framework of the Investment Committee. Eligible firms will be invited to provide bids on Provision of Consolidated and Integrated CIS Hardened Facility for ISAF Joint Command HQ at KAIA North in Kabul, Afghanistan.
<p>It is anticipated that this project will be incorporated into one contract. It is envisaged that the use of local sub-contractors will be permitted for this project.</p>
<p>In order to bid on this project, the primary contractor must 1) maintain a professionally active facility (office, factory, laboratory, etc.) in the United States, 2) be pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB), and 3) be nominated to the bidders list by the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>The total cost&nbsp;of the project is estimated to be &euro;6.0 million.</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce will be using IFB-CUR-ISAF-ENG-1206 as its reference for the IFB.</p>
<p>SUMMARY DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The object of the contract is provision of an integrated CIS facility at KAIA North in support of the Afghan Mission Network while consolidating assorted dispersed NATO CIS servers into one location. In addition to server space, the project will provide office space to host the Afghan Mission Network Operation Centre (AMNOC) which will serve as the command and control hub for the Afghan Mission Network. In particular, the works consist of a cast in-place concrete construction two-story building (column and beam). Contractor experience with the construction of reinforced concrete structures and earthworks and HQ construction type infrastructure in Afghanistan or Iraq is considered as an essential requirement.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Before a U.S. firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. The Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:<br />http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.</p>
<p>. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DEADLINES</p>
<p>Final date to request a DOE (and, for U.S. facilities not yet approved for NATO ICB, to submit a completed NATO ICB application): 21 March 2012</p>
<p>Planned tender release date: 05 April 2012</p>
<p>Scheduled bid closing date: 15 May 2012</p>

Throughout the visitor areas, interactive exhibits will expose visitors to the history, surrounding environment, principles and techniques of dam construction, power plant operations, and tour opportunities.  In addition, interpretive elements will feature some of the people and personalities important to the dam's history and operation as well as Reclamation's history and mission.

Exhibits across the site will aim to personalize the environment, dam, and recreation area and Reclamation and the Park Service and make the messages relevant to visitors.  The exhibit spaces should allow for random movement rather than only directed, sequential viewing.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source for additional scope of work toSpectrolab, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company in order to continuecritical mission high performance linear mode Indium Aluminum Arsenide (InAlAs) avalanchephotodiode (APD) arrays to support NASAs Earth Science Technology program.  The APD detector arrays will be integrated with transimpedance amplifiers (TIAs) andassembled into receiver arrays. The major objectives of this effort is to improve theperformance of present linear-mode APD arrays operating at 1.06 m, improve the quantumefficiency, reduce the NEP and dark current, maintain a bandwidth no less than 800 MHz,integrate the APD array with TIAs. Under the NASA ESTO QTA program, the vendor will usean alternative multiplication layer structure to reduce keff  to &lt;0.12  a keyrequirement for a low-noise APD receiver. In this program, the noise from both APDs andTIAs are critical to the overall receiver NEP, so careful matching of the two componentsand shielding of the external noise are extremely important to achieve the very low noiseequivalent power (NEP) specification.The performance of the additional scope by the current contractor will allow for thecontinued research and development of the lidar instruments and the avoidance ofsignificant adverse impacts to NASAs Advanced Component Technology (ACT) program.  NASA/GSFC has placed great emphasis on accountability and improving performance tomission success.  The performance of the additional scope by Spectrolab, Inc.,manufacture of the present APD arrays, is considered to be in the best interest of thegovernment, which would avoid the duplication of cost to the Government that is notexpected to be recovered through competition.

<RESPDATE>032612
<CONTACT>Susan Nsangou, Phone 3014432104, Email nsangous@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a quotation. A solicitation document will not be issued and quotations will not be requested.
<p>National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisitions intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Marine Biological Laboratory, 7 MBL Street, Woods Hole, MA, 02543-1015, for a program to supply important research on neural cells, neural cell membranes and neuronal signaling utilizing marine animals. The Division of Intramural Research (DIR), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes (NINDS), National Institute of Health (NIH), requires a summer program to supply important research on neural cells, neural cell membranes and neuronal signaling utilizing marine animals which offer unique approaches. Research was originally begun by NINDS at a marine laboratory because of the availability of the facilities that NINDS considered to be unique for the investigation of the nervous system of specific species, i.e., the squid giant axon.</p>
<p>This project is based on the need in the NINDS, DIR, for live squid to investigate the cellular functions underlying central nervous system function. Since adequate numbers of live squid cannot be transported to NIH, this work must be done at the collecting site, which has the facilities to provide necessary space, supplies, and research support. Approximately, five (5) NINDS, DIR scientists per year will require support. Examples of ongoing research include the use of squid giant axon and synapse for studies on ion channels, the biochemistry and metabolism of the axon, injury mechanisms, and regeneration.</p>
<p>Period of performance is 12 months, with the option to exercise up to four additional one-year option period(s.) It is anticipated that this requirement is for space approximately1,726 square feet.</p>
<p>The Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) is considered the only source for support of the NINDS summer intramural research program because of the following features available at the MBL.</p>
<p>&bull; Location: the MBL is located in Woods Hole, Massachusetts because here the marine fauna and flora are unusually abundant and varied due to the confluence of the Gulf Stream from the South and the Labrador current from the north. The highly varied coastline, with its numerous capes and bays, sand mud flats, open water and protected inlets also contribute to this remarkable abundance and diversity of marine species. The Loligo Pealei squid, which are utilized, are indigenous to the North Atlantic. Using another species would require redoing much of the molecular sequencing and working with smaller giant axons. This area is one of the major breeding and feeding grounds of Loligo pealeii . This location is deemed unique and ideal for the investigation of special features of the nervous systems of the large number of large squid (species Loligo pealeii) that are found in these waters. The MBL is within driving distance (eight (8) hours of NIH so special fragile equipment, such as microscopes, can be taken up in private cars.</p>
<p>&bull; Continuous availability of the squid: Loligo pealeii (squid) is available from late April to early December, a period of over 7 months per year. As research on the giant axon of the squid is a major component of the intramural research programs of the NINDS, the feature is considered highly significant. Studies in the past on the squid giant axon have led to major advances in the neurosciences. Squid on the West Coast has a much more limited season. No other laboratory in the U.S. has as long a squid season or as excellent collecting, maintenance and delivery facilities for these research animals thus assuring a continuous supply of large healthy squid.</p>
<p>&bull; Extensive chilled running sea water system piped to individual laboratories: Because the MBL is located at the southern tip of Cape Cod away from coastal rivers and estuaries, the quality and salinity of this water approaches that of the open ocean and constitutes a unique resource. The NINDS research program involves the use of short and long-term squid maintenance for studies ranging from electrophysiology and biochemistry to injury mechanisms and regeneration. This has been made possible by the availability of both the facility for mariculture and the excellent quality and supply of chilled seawater. This feature of MBL was considered as essential for the success of the neuroscience research programs.</p>
<p>&bull; Excellent ancillary support services: The MBL has available a machine shop, photographic and graphics laboratory, an extensive chemical and glassware supply room, a research services department to supply special equipment and expertise. The NIH had major equipment already installed at MBL, including a high voltage electron microscope and a Balzers freeze-etch apparatus. It would be extremely costly to move these to the West Coast. MBL also has unique collecting and holding facilities, including temperature adjusted holding tanks and a collecting vessel that collects squid in small batches which minimizes damage to them. On the West Coast, they are collected in large purse seines.</p>
<p><br />The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 12 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC><strong>TITLE:  NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center Protected Species Branch Turtle Tagging and Satellite Tag Data Collection</strong>
<p>The Eastern Acquisition Division (EAD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Norfolk, VA is soliciting proposals, on behalf of National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) Protected Species Branch (PSB) for contractor support of turtle tagging and satellite tag data collection.  A comprehensive research program to assess the abundance and spatial distribution of marine mammals, sea turtles, and sea birds in US waters of the western North Atlantic Ocean has been established as an inter-agency agreement (IA) between the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries Service).  The research program is called Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS).   The goal of AMAPPS is to coordinate the data collection and analysis efforts of the NOAA Fisheries Service Northeast and Southeast Fisheries Science Centers and the US Fish and Wildlife Service Division of Migratory Birds to accomplish six primary objectives: 1) Collect broad-scale data over multiple years on the seasonal distribution and abundance of marine mammals (cetaceans and pinnipeds), sea turtles, and sea birds using direct aerial and shipboard surveys of coastal US Atlantic Ocean waters; 2) Collect similar data at finer scales at several (approcximately 3) sites of particular interest to NOAA partners using visual and acoustic survey techniques; 3) Conduct telemetry studies of sea turtles, pinnipeds and seabirds to develop corrections for availability bias in the abundance estimate and to collect additional data on habitat use and life-history, residence time, and frequency of use; 4) Explore alternative platforms and technologies to improve population assessment studies; 5) Assess the population size of surveyed species at regional scales; and 6) Develop models and associated tools to translate these survey data into seasonal, spatially-explicit density estimates incorporating habitat characteristics.  PSB has a requirement for data from satellite tags on 20 juvenile and adult loggerhead sea turtles in the southern U.S. Mid-Atlantic region, ideally off of Virginia and northern North Carolina.  Additionally, the requirement includes additional work to assess sea turtle availability bias by 1) conducting experimental detection trials, 2) comparing estimates of availability bias based on aerial survey data verses satellite tag data, and 3) using simulations to evaluate various methods for combining sea turtle behavior and line transect data.<br /><br /><strong>SCOPE</strong><br />As a part of this the AMAPPS initiative, NEFSC PSB seeks to obtain information from at least 20 satellite tags on loggerhead sea turtles captured (via dipnet or other appropriate means) in near shore or inshore Mid-Atlantic waters.  NEFSC also seeks to improve the estimation of availability bias for loggerhead sea turtles in Mid-Atlantic waters.</p>
<p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong><br />In support of the operation of tagging the loggerhead sea turtles and tracking via satellite tag data, the Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, services, and facilities to perform the following services:  <br />1. Provide a seaworthy vessel for capturing and sampling loggerheads in offshore waters in Virginia and Northern North Carolina.<br />2. Supply all necessary gear to sight, capture, tag, and sample 20 loggerhead sea turtles.<br />3. Have minimum of four (4) qualified contractor vessel crew personnel available to sample 20 loggerhead sea turtles.<br />4. Produce a final report which includes the methods used for capture, handling, and sampling; the data collected; a discussion on any unusual or unexpected events, as well as a list of recommendations for improving similar projects in the future.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Government may exercise optional items for the following work:<br />1. Deploy twenty (20) model turtles in turbid areas which includes the Chesapeake Bay and in clearer areas which includes the Mid-Atlantic offshore at various depths and various angles.   Repeatedly fly over the models with a survey plane and conduct the detection trials in accordance with AMAPPS observing protocols.<br />2. Estimate availability bias.<br />3. Conduct experimental detection trials and analyze data to determine the depth at which turtles were available to be seen and its relationship to turbidity levels</p>
<p>A Request for Proposals (RFP) will be available on or about March 19, 2012 through the Government-wide point of entry website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The estimated due date for proposals is May 3, 2012.  The solicitation and proposed fixed-price contract will be issued utilizing the procedures identified in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation and will be evaluated on a best value basis wherein the following factors, 1-4, listed in descending order of importance, when combined, are significantly more important than Factor 5.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division, Panama City, Florida intends to award a contract to Pacific Star Communications, Inc, of 15055 SW SEQUOIA PKWY STE 100, Portland, OR 97224 on a sole source basis for the acquisition of thirty-four (34) each PACSTAR 1210 MAA Part Number PS-1210-550M with a standard two (2) year service plan for each item. This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition for the following reason. The PacStar 1210 provides Wide Area Network (WAN) communications acceleration and bandwidth optimization in a small, tactical form factor and is designed for in-theater communications, executive communications, vehicle mount, early-entry, or forward operating base deployments for military, Homeland Security, first responders and commercial/enterprise users.
  The PACSTAR 1210 is part of the entire Rapid Response Kit (RRK) and is integral to its operation.  The RRK system has received an Approval to Operate (ATO) from Naval Network Warfare Command and has been certified through interoperability certification.  Substituting other network components for the 1210 will invalidate the ATO and will invalidate any interoperability certification.  This would lead to considerable delays and additional costs in the fielding the Rapid Response capability.  This hardware is only available from the small business original equipment manufacturer (OEM)  they do not sell through resellers or distributors. 

Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018.

<DESC><p>In support of a user need request from the Office of New Reactors (NRO), the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) is developing guidance for regulatory review of hazard analysis (HA) relevant to digital instrumentation and control (DI&amp;C) safety systems in nuclear power plants (NPPs). This guidance, in the form of a research information letter (RIL-1101 titled "Technical Basis for Review Guidance for Digital Instrumentation and Control Safety Systems"), provides an integrated perspective for reviewing various aspects of HA, addressed in different parts of NRC's standard review plan (SRP), NUREG-0800, chapter 7. RIL-1101 focuses on integration of existing knowledge, including knowledge from the review of publicly available technical literature, as well as, knowledge from respective experts - the latter, being sought through this statement of work. RIL-1101 provides the technical basis to assist the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff in the exercise of judgment in the evaluation of HA for DI&amp;C safety systems in NPPs, in a risk-informed performance-based manner.</p>
<p>The initial application of RIL-1101 is targeted for the licensing reviews of Small Modular Reactors (SMR), in support of NRO's "Design Specific Review Standard" (DSRS), i.e., design-specific SRP, for individual advanced reactor designs beginning with mPower. Lessons learned from the mPower application will be incorporated for use in future reviews.</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to obtain high quality professional engineering and scientific services from the Contractor to integrate into RIL-1101 relevant knowledge from respective experts through technical peer reviews. The project seeks knowledge from multiple experts in different disciplines.</p>

<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION<br />This is a request for information (RFI) only. This RFI is not a request for competitive proposal; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the requestor to form a binding contract. In developing your response, you are reminded that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or pay for the information requested. This is not a request for proposal or an invitation for bid and participation in this RFI does not ensure participation in future solicitations or contract awards. The government assumes no responsibility for costs incurred by the contractor in responding to this RFI. These costs remain solely the responsibility of the responding company and response is voluntary.
<p><br />BACKGROUND <br />The US Government (USG) maintains a fleet of over 600 T-6 training aircraft which averages an approximate tire consumption of over 10,000 tires annually. The T-6 training aircraft currently uses only a bias ply tire design. The USG is conducting an analysis to determine if it is cost effective to switch the T-6 training aircraft fleet from a bias ply tire to a radial ply tire design.</p>
<p>GENERAL INTENT<br />The purpose of this RFI is to gather information on tire cost and reliability data for a bias ply tire design and a radial ply tire design that would support the USG T-6 training aircraft fleet in an effort to decrease life cycle costs.</p>
<p>Before any decision is made, the USG will conduct a cost benefit analysis to compare life cycle cost between the bias ply tire design and the radial ply tire design for use in the T-6 fleet. Companies interested in participating in this market research are asked to provide the following information:</p>
<p>&bull; Price per tire for the bias ply tire design, size 20x4.4 14PR (estimated quantity of about 830 tires per month or 10,200 tires per year); and/or,</p>
<p>&bull; Price per tire for the radial tire design, size 20x4.4R12 14PR (estimated quantity of about 830 tires per month or 10,200 tires per year);</p>
<p>&bull; Predicted reliability data (wear information) in landings per tire if available;</p>
<p>&bull; Information on any FAA tire certification status; and</p>
<p>&bull; Information on bulk purchase discounts or quantity pricing if available</p>
<p>The USG would greatly appreciate industry participation in this market research. Please provide written responses to this RFI on a company letterhead with contact information to the contractual point of contact (POC) listed below no later than 30 days from the date of this posting via electronic mail or regular mail (no facsimile). Submitted material will be considered the property of the United States government and will not be returned or shared with outside parties.&nbsp; Please direct any technical questions to Mr. David Groendyk, <a href="mailto:David.groendyk@wpafb.af.mil">David.groendyk@wpafb.af.mil</a>, 937-674-4282.<br /><br />CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS<br />WPAFB/WNZJC, 1970 Monahan Way, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433<br />POC: Mr. Jason Ash, <a href="mailto:Jason.ash@wpafb.af.mil">Jason.ash@wpafb.af.mil</a>, 937-904-4535</p>

Timeline for operational implementation and potential timeline for delivery of 3500-4000 devices<br />2. A short, UNCLASSIFIED presentation (no more than 20 slides) to be briefed to an isolated government EFB focused audience on Industry Day<br />Abstracts must be written in Microsoft Word and presentations must be built in Microsoft PowerPoint. Please exclude videos from submissions.<br />Each presenter will be allotted 45 minutes for presentation, questions/answers, discussion, and comments. Space will be provided for all selected companies to display/demonstrate their product.<br />HQ AFSOC Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation and Platform Requirements will select the most applicable abstracts and invite selected companies/academia (based upon the abstracts) to present a private, UNCLASSIFIED briefing to an isolated government EFB focused audience. The audience is expected to include representatives from HQ AFSOC, AFSOC field units, Air Force Flight Standards Agency, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Air Force Research Laboratory, Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), other military commands, DoD agencies, and Services. Abstracts and presentations should focus on currently available COTS efforts/concepts only.<br />HQ AFSOC will provide notification and schedule/agenda to selected companies and academia NLT 1200pm CDT on Monday, 26 Mar, 2012.<br />Information gained from "Electronic Flight Bags (EFB) Industry Day" will be used to enhance continuous exchange of EFB efficiencies, problems, practices, and solutions among government organizations. Additionally, information gained may be used to inform senior leaders and become the basis for defining government requirements.<br />Questions/additional information can be sent to email: AFSOC.EFBindustryday@hurlburt.af.mil.<br />Note: Information presented and obtained during "Electronic Flight Bags (EFB) Industry Day" shall not be considered as a solicitation for competitive bid, nor will it obligate the government to any contractual action.

<DESC>Market Survey for the Production of High-Purity NaNT (sodium 5 nitrotetrazolate)
The United States Army RDECOM - ARDEC is currently conducting a market survey to identify companies with the capability to safely produce high-purity batches of sodium 5-nitrotetrazolate (NaNT).  Although it is an explosive material, NaNT is almost always employed as a precursor to other explosives, in particular primary explosives useful for detonator applications.Respondents must be able to show that they can produce a solution product that contains NaNT at least 99% purity. Respondents shall provide conclusive evidence of their capability regarding the purity of their NaNT material through analytical methods such as HPLC and LC-MS. 
Respondents shall provide the U.S. Army a detailed description(s) of their NaNT solution, including chemical and physical properties, current production level, production capacity, product cost, and a brief summary of their companys capabilities including description of facilities, personnel, past production experience and environmental compliance as it relates to the product(s).  Additionally, respondent shall provide a name/address/point of contact with telephone and email information, business size, and facility location.  Upon review of the submission(s) the U.S. Government may request a respondent to fill out a detailed questionnaire and may request on-site visits to your facility at no cost or obligation to the Government. 
This sources sought notice is for information and planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey. Any information provided will not be returned.

<DESC>This is published as a sole source announcement under the statutory authority at 10 USC 2304(c) (1), and regulatory authority at FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Tobyhanna Division-Contract Operations Branch, Tobyhanna Army Depot(TYAD), Tobyhanna, PA 18444 intends to negotiate and award a contract on a sole source basis to Lockheed Martin Corporation, Global Training and Logistic-Development Division, 100 Global Innovation Circle, Orlando, FL 32825-5002, for a quantity of one (1) LM-STAR Radio Frequency Automated Test System to include; installation, re-hosting existing Government owned Test Program Sets(TPS) from Tobyhanna Army Depot's Automated Test Systems (ATS) to the LM-STAR Radio Frequency Automated Test System (LM-STAR), one year of technical support for all installed software and hardware, LM-STAR system operating and maintenance training for Government employees, technical manuals and one year commercial warranty.  The LM-STAR is a commercial variant of the Navy's Consolidated Automated Support System (CASS) and Electronic Consolidated Automated Support System (ECASS) approved systems and is an open software architecture based on National Instruments Test suite software of Lab View, Test Stand, and Lab Windows with associated hardware components drivers using Windows type user interfacing. TYAD's current Army Navy General Utility Special Maintenance-410 (AN/USM-410) Electronic Quality Assurance Test Equipment (EQUATE) system which is utilized to test hundreds of items with is based upon EQUATE ATLAS TPS development.  The AN/ USM-410 is over 40 years old and has become unsupportable. Lockheed Martin Global Training and Logistic-Development Division (Lockheed Martin) is the original designer and developer and support contractor of the AN/USM-410, and has demonstrated that the LM-STAR is capable of supporting the migration of USM-410 TPS with minimal effort. TYAD requires the LM-STAR system in support of Army, Navy and Marine Corps mission work load, and will utilize the LM-STAR for the repair and testing of Army Navy Ground Transportable Radar Special (AN/TPQ)-36, (AN/TPQ)-37 and (AN/TPQ)-46A FireFinder Radar systems, as well as to support expansion capabilities for all Department of Defense (DoD) service workloads repaired at TYAD as part of a modernization program. The LM-STAR meets the requirements of Army Regulation 750-3, Section IV, Automatic Test Equipment Policy and Management, which dictates Policy that all new or changing requirements for automated testing must use one of the DoD standard families of test systems as defined within DoD ATS Selection Process Guide 2009.  The Government does not have the required technical data package to pursue a competitive acquisition.  Lockheed Martin is the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the LM-STAR, and owns the proprietary rights, hardware schematics and data rights.  Lockheed Martin is the only contractor who can provide the LM-STAR and meet the government's requirements. The required delivery is one (1) year after date of award.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Any firms believing they can provide the requirements for the LM-Star Radio Frequency Automated Test System requirement should within ten (10) days of this notice, contact the Contract Specialist identified below, and submit a capability statement which will be reviewed for consideration.

<DESC>The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, Upper Colorado Region is conducting a market survey to locate SBA certified Section 8(a), HubZone (Historically Underutilized Business Zones), SDVOSB (Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business), WOSB (Woman-Owned Small Business), as well as large businesses, who are interested and determined qualified to perform construction services at Echo Dam.  The project is for the demolition and construction of a seismic spillway modification at Echo Dam, approximately 4 miles north of Coalville, Utah.
This is NOT a request for proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the contractor or Government to perform these services.  Responses to this notice will only be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.
The Government anticipates awarding a Firm, Fixed, Unit-Price construction contract.  The extent of competition for this requirement will depend on responses to this synopsis.
The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities, and qualifications of 8(a), HubZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, or other small or large businesses who can perform the work outlined below.
Anticipated Major Components of Work:
Spillway Control Section, Transition, and Chute Demolition and Reconstruction:
The size of the existing concrete spillway structure control section that supports the radial control gates is relatively large, approximately 80-feet wide by 27-feet tall.  There are four 18-foot wide by 17-feet high steel radial control gates. The concrete structure supports the four large steel radial gates - these are used to regulate the flows from storage in the upper 17-feet of the reservoir. Demolition work shall consist of removal of the gate control section, downstream transition section, and invert of the upper portion of the chute.  A reinforced concrete overlay on the sloped chute walls shall be constructed as part of the reconstruction.  The maximum size of reinforcement bars that will be used in the structure are number 11 bar.  Concrete repair shall be performed on portions of the concrete approach apron upstream of the control section.
The four control gates and hoists shall be removed and refurbished for reinstallation in the newly constructed structure.  An under-drain system shall be constructed under the new spillway and chute section.  The newly constructed reinforced concrete spillway structure shall consist of mass concrete placements with footing thickness of up to 7-feet and wall thickness 6-feet 3-inches.  The structure shall be built to tolerances that shall provide smooth operation and sealing of the radial gates.  A large portion of the concrete work shall be performed during cold weather conditions.  The transition and chute portion of the spillway shall be replaced with new reinforced concrete.  Electrical work shall be required to restore operation of the gates, upon reinstallation of the gates and hoists.

<DESC>USNS Waters (TAGS-45) is an MSC Navigation Test Support Ship. USNS WATERS was originally an oceanographic survey ship, built by the Avondale Shipyard and delivered to the US Navy in 1993. Under the sponsorship of the Strategic Systems Program Office, Waters was converted in 1998 by Detyens Shipyard to support submarine navigation system testing and ballistic missile flight test support services. The vessel is operated by the US Navy - Military Sealift Command (MSC). The vessel has a diesel-electric drive, twin shafts, 7,400 shaft horsepower with a centralized automation and propulsion system. The automation system was updated in 2010 by Beach Panel due to obsolescence issues. The electrical load management system and the propulsion SCR drives are obsolete and supportability is becoming an issue. Military Sealift Command intends to replace the electrical load management system and the propulsion system with new technology. The intent of the replacement is to keep the same basic form, fit and function of the existing Propulsion and Electrical Systems. The new system shall be supportable for a minimum of 15 years and must meet the entire requirement for the ABS SVR 2010 in order to maintain its ACCU certification.

<DESC>***NOAA's Acquisition and Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division - Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the Regents of the University of Colorado of Boulder, CO, for research, development, and oversight of a Dedicated 14C Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Facility.
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) requirement for continued ongoing research by the Regents of the University of Colorado being a unique source of knowledge and expertise for enhanced carbon cycle science in creating an accurate record of global greenhouse gases (GHGs)  that can withstand the test of time as well as interpreting the record in terms of changing emissions and removals over very large areas caused by natural biogeochemical cycles and directly by human activities.  With increasing awareness of the risks posed by global climate change, a new, third, goal is to develop an objective method to quantify direct emissions by human activities on a national and regional scale, complementary to, and as an independent check on, self-reported inventories.  It is expected that such capability will strengthen national policies as well as international agreements to decrease emissions.  In the case of CO2, the main difficulty is that, although its long-term increase is dominated by the burning of fossil fuels, at any one time and place, the atmospheric CO2signal is typically dominated by seasonal diurnal variability caused by the natural carbon cycle.  It is therefore necessary to separate the fossil fuel component from the natural component in the atmospheric observations themselves.</p>
<p>Systematic measurements of 14CO2 are a nearly perfect way to separate recent (1-2 weeks) emissions of CO2 caused by fossil fuel burning from the CO2exchanged with land ecosystems and the oceans.  The 14CO2 content of coal, oil, and natural gas is zero, whereas that of almost all ecosystems and oceans is very close to equilibrium with the atmosphere.  Thus, an accurate measurement of the depletion of 14C in ambient CO2 relative to "background" air quantifies the recent addition of 14C-free, or fossil, carbon.  The ability to quantitatively remove the fossil component from ambient CO2 will also lead to improvements in our understanding of natural CO2 exchange.  14CO2 and CO2 are very stable chemically and observations of 14C depletion are already being used to constrain the emissions of a number of other trace gases (by correlation to 14CO2).  The chemical stability confers the further advantage that it can be used to test and improve the representation of transport in atmospheric models.  14CO2 measurements are therefore the key to quantifying the anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and many other gases.</p>
<p>For the 14CO2 method to reach its potential, the capability to make these measurements has to be expanded by more than an order of magnitude, from its current number of several hundred per year to many thousands per year.  A recent report of the National Research Council recommends that ~10,000 measurements worldwide (with approximately half of these in the conterminous US) will be needed to provide for direct verification of GHG emissions.</p>
<p>The period of performance shall May 1, 2012 through September 30, 2012.</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>      Sources Sought/Vendor Technical Questions
               N00104-12-I-Q373
  NCTS Jacksonville Detachment Key West, Florida

The Naval Weapons System Support (NAVSUP WSS), Mechanicsburg PA and the  Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station Atlantic (NCTAMS LANT), Norfolk VA (acting as Regional HQ for NCTS Jacksonville, FL) are issuing this combination  Sources Sought Notice /Request for Information-Vendor Technical Question Period, for HF Radio and IT Telecommunications Support in Key West, Florida.
 
This effort includes the tasks as described in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).
 
The combined objective of this Sources Sought/RFI notice is to gain information from industry reference the technical requirements of the PWS and to facilitate the NAVSUP Contracting Officers review of the market base required for acquisition planning/size determination.
 (unrestricted vs set-aside).  

This Sources Sought provides an opportunity for respondents to submit their technical questions/comments to the PWS and to submit their availability and potential to fulfill the Navy requirement related to this request in the form of a capability package.

This Sources Sought/RFI is released pursuant to FAR Part 15.201(e), Exchanges with Industry. 

Note:  The NCTS Jacksonville Det Key West HF missions are scheduled to be transferred to another DoD facility and this will result in ending the contract requirement to continue support for the HF Radio and IT Telecommunication requirements and tasks listed in the attached PWS.  

The exact date for ending the contract requirement is yet to be determined and is contingent upon the Navys Global Modernization program to transition HF support requirements to the Air Force HF Global Communications System (HFGCS).
 The date of mission transfer is estimated at no earlier than August 2012. 

The resulting contract, if any, will have a short base period of performance through September 2012, and six 2-month option periods through September 2013. 

 Due to the inability to predict the date for HF mission transfer as discussed above, the six 2-month option periods may or may not be exercised in part or in whole.

See attached RFI Instructions and Draft PWS

<DESC>Description <br />This is a sources sought synopsis for written information from all parties, especially small and small disadvantaged firms, interested in the upcoming acquisition for operation and maintenance services for the Alaska Radar System. The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. There is no solicitation available at this time. Responses should focus on your firm's technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services for the operation and maintenance of the radar sites in the Alaska Radar System, as described below. You should address the contracting officer's interest items on (i) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, and (ii) commercial practices; standard publicity brochures are not particularly desired. Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted. The contractor shall be responsible for all operation and maintenance of the manned AN/FPS-117 long-range radars, as well as the ~135 site facilities (real property, real property installed equipment, and utility systems) at approximately 15 remote Alaska locations, on Alaska's northern and western coasts and mountain interior and 3 remote radio sites located at Valdez, Middleton and St. Paul Islands. Methods of access vary by site, but each can be reached by a combination of road, air and/or seasonal barge. The contractor will also be responsible for the Maintenance Control and Communications Center and for certain equipment in the Regional Air Operations Center at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska. Radar operations and maintenance, and other communications-electronics systems, is the core of the requirement, but facilities support is also critical to mission success. The contractor is responsible for maintenance and snow removal for seven gravel airstrips, over 50 miles of gravel roads, utilities, water and sewage systems, power generation, and environmental protection. Transportation, logistics, food service and housekeeping, and weather operations are also important elements of operation. The Government anticipates issueing the solicitation in the winter of 2012, with award in the November 2013 time frame, with phase-in starting January 2014, and performance beginning on 1 October 2014. The current and previous contracts were solicited on an unrestricted basis, but the Government solicits capability statements and expressions of interest and intent from small businesses. Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise on radars, please include information as to the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement. Small businesses (including veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women-owned, and other small businesses) are particularly invited to respond to express interest in submitting a proposal and to provide information as to their qualifications. The current contract was acquired with SIC 8744, Facilities Support Management Services. The corresponding NAICS is 561210, Facilities Support Services. The corresponding size standard is $35.5M. The contracting officer invites input as to whether 513390 for radar station operations is not a more appropriate NAICS. The current contract's Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for industry review. It is anticipated that the requirements will be similar to those of the current contract. Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities, and resources to satisfactorily perform the mission as stated in the PWS. Capability statements of up to 15 pages in length may be submitted to the Contracting Officer, Mark D. Bacon, 673 CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, AK 99506, and are requested by 4 Apr 2012. Email submissions are preferred but are limited to 10 MB due to system limitations. Please send e-mails with Delivery/Read Receipts to verify receipt.<br />

<CONTACT>Dmitriy Radchenko, Phone (703) 666-5411, Email dRadchenko@usaid.gov
<DESC>General
<p>This is a Request for Information by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Office of the Chief Information Officer, Chief Information Security Office (CIO CISO).  This is not a Request for Proposal and no submissions will be accepted as official offers for contract.</p>
<p>The CIO CISO is conducting an RFI as market research to determine the capability of industry to provide an Enterprise Risk Assessment on USAID's Enterprise Network.  In response to this RFI, please provide potential solution capabilities that you currently have related to all required personnel, equipment, supplies, software, facilities, transportation, materials, and any other items and services necessary to address the described need below.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>CIO CISO has a need to complete an Enterprise Risk Assessment on the USAID Network, End Devices, Policy, and Procedures.</p>
<p>Based on Government mandated requirements set forth by OMB Circular No. 130, Title III of the E-Government Act, entitled the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), and follow on documents developed by NIST (800-30, 800-37,800-39, etc.).  USAID must have specific actions in place to mitigate enterprise risk.  Additionally USAID is in the process of developing a new secondary/back up data center and would like to have a completed enterprise risk assessment study to discover any potential threats.</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>The purpose of this effort is to provide a framework for risk management, which will involve a report identifying particular events or circumstances relevant to USAID's objectives.  This report shall assess the potential risks associated with the current Enterprise Network and determine a response strategy moving forward.</p>
<p>Objectives<br />&bull;	To understand any and all current enterprise network risks.<br />&bull;	To discover any potential enterprise network risks.<br />&bull;	To assess current policies for USAID's enterprise network.<br />&bull;	To assess current metrics in place for reducing enterprise risk.<br />&bull;	To assess USAID's current risk mitigation actions compared to top industry standards.<br />&bull;	To discover policy necessary to reduce risk.<br />&bull;	To implement metrics and policies to reduce and mitigate risks.<br />&bull;	To suggest tools to be used in the implementation of enterprise risk mitigation at USAID.<br />Contractor shall describe their methodologies for an Enterprise Risk Assessment with and not limited to proposed timelines, steps, and costs.  Contractor's assessment must provide detailed findings based on the stated objectives and suggest solutions and strategies to reduce and mitigate all Enterprise Level Risks associated with the current USAID Enterprise Network.</p>
<p>In addition to an Enterprise Risk Assessment report, contractor may be requested to provide support to implement all solutions to mitigate risks found within the enterprise.</p>
<p>Security Requirements</p>
<p>Vendor must meet all necessary Agency security requirements and policies to include but are not limited to: personnel security, residency requirements, suitability requirements, and privacy requirements.</p>
<p>Vendor staff participating in an Enterprise Risk Assessment for USAID must have valid and active SECRET clearances.</p>
<p>Contractor Suitability Requirement</p>
<p>Access to USAID facilities and information is subject to specific security and suitability requirements.  USAID reserves the right and prerogative to deny and/or restrict facility and information access of any contractor employee determined by USAID, at any time during performance, to be unsuitable for access and/or present a risk of compromising sensitive government information to which  he or she would have access to under this contract.  Contractors will be allotted a reasonable amount of time, determined by the government, to replace the employee found not suitable for continued contract performance.  Failure to replace the employee may result in a no cost termination for cause by the government.</p>
<p>Additional Considerations</p>
<p>Vendor must include estimated cost/pricing and timeline for completing an Enterprise Risk Assessment on-site in a government office.  Vendor may provide costs for performing 50% of the work on-site (assessment) and 50% of the work offsite (report/conclusions development).</p>
<p>In addition Vendors response must include description of capabilities and methodologies for completing an Enterprise Risk Assessment.</p>

<DESC>The Mission and Installation Contracting Command-Fort Bliss, intends to award on a sole-source basis to the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, a  contract for the acquisition of services for labor, supervision and required materials to train U. S. military in Counterinsurgency and Counter Improvised Explosive Device training in a hyper-realistic training environment.   In preparation for 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division's (1/AD) s (1/1AD) Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) Rotation and to properly certify these Companies/Troops, a realistic environment that accurately replicates the environment 1/1AD will operate in for OEF is required.  1/1AD requires facilities use for training such as an Afghan market, a mountain village, an adobe compound, two nomadic transient sites which are crucial to training, After Action Review (AAR) facilities, a white cell (exercise control) building, and classroom area for training and conference room for the white cell.  The only place that will adequately prepare 1/1AD in the time period required is the New Mexico Tech Playas Training and Research Center (PTRC); Fort Bliss currently does not have this capability.  The capabilities required are mock villages, role players, exercise controls,  AAR facilities, and biometric equipment.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a one-time sole source contract with Rescue Solutions International, Inc, 708 SW Umatilla Avenue, Redmond, OR 97756 for a Rope Launch System. The Government intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 332999 - All other miscellaneous Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing; the size standard is 750 employees.</p>
<p>The FBI is responsible for providing safety operations at high hazard crime scenes. The FBI frequently operates in locations where advanced techniques are required to gain access to and locate evidence and other items of interest. A critical need identified is the ability to utilize rope systems to gain access to remote, excessively high or distant sites that contain evidence. This work can be highly dangerous and requires personnel be provided with equipment to achieve the mission goals safely. Rescue Solutions International provides a rope launch system that does not use pyrotechnics to launch the rope which significantly improves the level of safety based on the FBI's potential platforms. Rescue Solutions International is the sole manufacturer of this system and is available only through Rescue Solutions International.</p>
<p>Based on market research conducted and contacts made with knowledgeable individuals within the government and related industry, it has been determined the FBI's requirement can only be provided by Rescue Solutions International, as no other vendor is capable of providing this system is in accordance with the FBI's safety requirements.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals to this office by 10:00 am, EST, by March 20, 2012, by email to the attention of Jerry Varnell, Contract Specialist, at Jerry.Varnell@ic.fbi.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone requests will not be considered.

The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) in Portland Oregon intends to award a contract for the acquisition of services survey and conditions assessment of 10 spots with rock art habitation, Lincoln County, Nevada, under the authority of the Lincoln County Land Act (LCLA).  The LCLA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to expend without further appropriation the revenue deposited in the LCLA Account for inventory, evaluation, protection, and management of unique archeological resources in Lincoln County.  The Secretary of the Interior has delegated the authority for expenditure of these funds to the Director of the BLM.  The acquisition was competed by the BLM under solicitation # L09PS00006 on 12/18/08. The Archaeological Resources Team (ART) (acting as the technical proposal evaluation committee) reviewed the proposals and selected 6 proposals to fund, two of which are on land under the FWS jurisdiction.  The Partner=BFs Working Group and the Executive Committee agreed with their recommendation and the Decision Memo was signed by the Director 10/21/09 giving authorization for the funds to be expended.  Because this procurement was competed by BLM, no solicitation or request for quote is available for this procurement.  Any questions or comments should be emailed to Josh Gordon ( josh_gordon@fws.gov) by 03/22/2012, 1500 PST.  The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services. The size standard is 7 M.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Material Measurement Laboratory (MML), intends to negotiate with Physik Instrumente (PI), Auburn, MA, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a Single Source , to acquire a Piezo XYZ Stage and Controller for Super Resolution CARS, to upgrade existing equipment ( a Polytec, PI XY Stage M-686.D64) currently in use at the NIST, which will enable the NIST/MML to make improvements in the technology and development of measurement tools which have been developed to accommodate the required systems and system elements. The award will be a firm fixed price purchase order.
<p>Must be 100 percent hardware and software compatible with the existing equipment.</p>
<p>The proprietary technology and patent protected instruments of PI are the only instruments capable of ensuring a fully operational system. No other manufacturers or distributers can meet the software or hardware pin-to-pin compatibility. If other manufacturer instruments were utilized, the system would not function properly. In addition, it would void the warranty of the PI Super Resolution CARS scanning system currently in operation at NIST.</p>
<p>The system must meet the minimum requirements of which PI is the sole provider:</p>
<p>1 ea: Super Resolution CARS Scanning System, PIMars XYZ Piezo-Nonopositioning System, 300x300x300 um, Parallel Metrology.</p>
<p>1 ea: Modular Digital Multi-Channel Piezo Controller 3 Channels, Capacitive Sensors; and</p>
<p>1 ea: 25x75mm Slide Holder.</p>
<p>Must be 100% pin-to-pin compatible so that it can be used with existing hardware to enable it to connect from one plug into another.</p>
<p>Deviation from any of this compatibility would result in a reduced level of performance and extensive costly reengineering and retrofitting.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>This is not a solicitation for competitive quotes. However, interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirement listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the resonse date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing via email to Cheryl Coxen at cheryl.coxen@nist.gov.<br />All responses to this notice of intent must be submitted so that they are received no later than noon, March 26, 2012.at 12:00 PM EST.</p>

OCLC Cataloging Subscription:

The OCLC WorldCat database has bibliographic records that will be available for use by VALNET to catalog titles added to their collections, output being either catalog cards, or electronic MARC records for import into local online access catalogs.   OCLC WorldCat also provides the capability for libraries to add bibliographic records for titles that are held by VALNET libraries, but for which corresponding records do not already exist in the database.  Unique library holdings will be attached to all records for which cataloging or set holdings is requested.

OCLC WorldCat Resource Sharing Subscription:

The Resource Sharing subscriptions will provide all VALNET libraries with database access for identifying holders of information materials from over 10,000 libraries in 40 countries, as well as the capability to manage interlibrary loan policies, establish constant work form data, join free-share groups, and track borrowed and loaned material efficiently.   Unique holdings codes for VALNET libraries will ensure that VA-owned material is consistently available across the network.

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>Subfactor 3 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: http://orca.bpn.gov/publicsearch.aspx.

<p>The following FAR, DFARS, and DLAD clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition. The full text version of these clauses and provisions may be viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.</p>
<p>FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offers-Commercial Items - Addenda to 52.212-1; the following paragraphs are hereby deleted from this provision: (e) multiple offers and (h) multiple awards.</p>
<p>NOTE: To receive an award resulting from this solicitation, offerors MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database IAW FAR 52.212-1(k) and DFARS 204.1104. Registration may be done on line at: www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9000 AGENCY PROTESTS (SEP 1999)</p>
<p>Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the Contracting Officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9001 DISPUTES: AGREEMENT TO USE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) (NOV 2011)</p>
<p>(a)The parties agree to negotiate with each other to try to resolve any disputes that may arise. If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.</p>

<p>Section 6 Evaluation Factors</p>
<p>The Government intends to use a technical/price tradeoff process to award a Firm Fixed Price type contract to the responsible Offeror whose quote represents the best value to the Government, evaluated cost/price and other factors considered. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest-cost/priced Offeror or to the Offeror with the highest technical rating if the Contracting Officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of quotes, the Contracting Officer will review them to determine if each Offeror followed all of the quotation preparation/submission instructions in this solicitation. A quotation that did not follow the submission instructions may be deemed unacceptable and may not be further evaluated.</p>
<p>Each quote will be evaluated against the factors described below. An Offeror's failure to address any factor may be considered indicative of the Offeror's lack of understanding of the Government's requirements and may result in the quote being determined unacceptable.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors for Award:</p>
<p>FACTOR A - TECHNICAL APPROACH <br />FACTOR B - EXPERIENCE <br />FACTOR C - PAST PERFORMANCE <br />FACTOR D - KEY PERSONNEL<br />FACTOR E - PRICE</p>
<p>In determining best value, non-price Factors A through D, when combined, are approximately equal in importance to evaluated cost/price. Factors A and B are the most important factors, and are slightly more important than Factors C and D. Factors C and D are approximately equal in importance.</p>
<p>Factor A - Technical Approach</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the requirements, MML's role, and the complexity of developing and maintaining the webbook; the extent to which its technical approach to the statement of work, demonstrate its ability to provide the required services; and the risks associated with its technical approach.<br /><br />Factor B - Experience</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's experience to determine the extent to which the general background, experience, and qualifications demonstrate its ability to perform similar services.</p>
<p>Factor C - Past Performance Information</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the Offeror's and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance information to determine its relevance to the current requirements and the extent to which it demonstrates that the Offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past three years.</p>
<p>In assessing the Offeror's past performance, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of past work to determine the quality of service, and the extent to which the Offeror has performed work of a similar type, magnitude, and complexity. The Government will assign a neutral rating to Offerors with no relevant past performance.</p>
<p>Factor D - Key Personnel Qualifications</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the extent to which the resumes submitted for the Offeror's proposed key personnel demonstrate they have satisfied the minimum requirements described in the SOW and have appropriate education, qualifications, and experience necessary to successfully perform the contract requirements.</p>
<p>Cost/Price Evaluation</p>
<p>The proposed cost will be evaluated but not scored.<br /><br />1. The Government will evaluate whether the quoted cost/price is fair and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements and consistent with the Offeror's proposed Technical Approach.</p>
<p>2. The Government may use the results of a cost realism analysis to adjust the offeror's proposal to a most probable cost to the Government, for example, price/cost may be adjusted for evaluation purposes if they are deemed to be unrealistically high or low. This may include information from a Government auditing agency, Government technical personnel, and other sources.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>National Fish Habitat Partnership Support Background</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is mandated by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to conserve and manage our nation&rsquo;s marine living resources. The NMFS Office of Science and Technology (ST) advocates for and ensures sound scientific basis for NMFS&rsquo; resource conservation and management decisions. The ST Assessment and Monitoring Division is home to the habitat science program and leads ongoing initiatives to increase support for habitat science and improve the quantity and quality of habitat science produced by the agency to support resource conservation and management efforts. Specifically, ST is responsible for working with the NMFS Office of Habitat Conservation to coordinate NOAA&rsquo;s work with the National Fish Habitat Partnership (NFHP). In particular, ST coordinates NOAA&rsquo;s scientific contributions to NFHP, working with the NFHP Science and Data Committee, other assessment teams, and the regional Fish Habitat Partnerships on the development of national habitat assessments every five years and other science-based habitat projects. ST is leading the ongoing development of the marine (estuarine, coastal, and offshore) components of the next national assessment, scheduled for completion in 2015. Contract support is required to assist in the development of the first phase of the 2015 NFHP marine assessment, specifically for initial data collection and processing efforts.</p>

This announcement will close at 4:00 PM (local time) on March 26, 2012.
  Contact Dennis Bilger who can be reached at 215-697-9626 or email dennis.bilger@navy.mil.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency.  
 
FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors - a combination of price and past performance.  The relative importance of the factors is as follows [past performance is more important than price.] 

The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms.
 Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.
  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoters past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.
  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ. The Government reserves the right to award the contract to other than the lowest priced quoter.

Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ . 

All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

<DESC>This specification outlines the minimum requirements necessary to meet ARM's science goals with the Ka-band ARM Zenith Radar (KAZR) and the associated infrastructure to install the KAZR at each of the identified ARM sites.
<p>The KAZR, now deployed at 5 ARM sites, is the latest version of a zenith-pointing cloud radar that has been in ARM's inventory since the mid-1990s. The radar began as the MilliMeter-wave Cloud Radar (MMCR) developed by NOAA's Environmental Technology Laboratory (ETL) in Boulder, CO. The MMCR went through three major revisions. In 2010, specifications and design for a totally new radar were established which is now termed the KAZR. Deployment of KAZR and retirement of MMCR happened throughout 2011.</p>
<p>The ARM Program has recently been funded to deploy two new sites. One will be at Oliktok Point, Alaska and the other will be on Graciosa Island in the Azores. This RFP is for the KAZRs that will be deployed at those sites.</p>

Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103.

Unreasonably low or high proposed prices may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition.<br> Total Evaluated Price - The total evaluated price to be used for the determination of reasonableness will be calculated as follows:  <br>(i).The evaluated price for each CLIN is the unit price proposed for the CLIN multiplied by the quantity specified in the Schedule for that CLIN.   <br>(ii).

See Statement of Work<BR><BR>Listed is some information regarding the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.  This is not the Act itself.  
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act protects migratory birds. The original 1918 statute implemented a 1916 Treaty between the U.S. and Great Britain (for Canada) for the protection of migratory birds. Later amendments implemented treaties between the U.S. and Mexico, the U.S. and Japan, and the U.S. and the Soviet Union (now Russia). Specific provisions in the statute include a Federal prohibition to "pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, attempt to take, capture or kill, possess, offer for sale, sell, offer to purchase, purchase, deliver for shipment, ship, cause to be shipped, deliver for transportation, transport, cause to be transported, carry, or cause to be carried by any means whatever, receive for shipment, transportation or carriage, or export, at any time, or in any manner, any migratory bird, included in the terms of this Convention . . . for the protection of migratory birds . . . or any part, nest, or egg of any such bird." (16 U.S.C. 703). This applies to birds included in international conventions between the U.S. and Great Britain, the U.S. and Mexico, the U.S. and Japan, and the U.S. and the Russia.
 The responsibilities of Federal agencies to protect migratory birds are set forth in Executive Order 13186. US Fish and Wildlife Service is the lead agency for migratory birds. FSA and NRCS are currently working with USFWS to establish an MOU on migratory birds in compliance with EO 13186. The birds protected under this statute are many of our most common species, as well as birds listed as threatened or endangered. View a list of birds protected by the MBTA and other related bird information.
To follow the U.S. Fish & Wildlife laws under the Migratroy Bird Treaty the Osprey birds cannon be disturbed during their breeding season from April 1 through September 1.For New Mexico, the nexting period for migratory birds is<BR><BR>Reclamation requires proof of certification for the use of any herbicides on Federal property.  Federal and states laws have to be followed.    EPA is in charge of these requirements currently, certification is required for any vendor who collects money for their services.  No restricted chemicals can be applied on Reclamation property unless permission is received from Washington DC.  Navajo Dam does not have permission to use restricted chemicals.<BR><BR>No protected species of vegetation have been located on these properties.   Our environmental group checks this out yearly, as well as other federal agencies and the public.  Navajo Dam employees are familiar with protected species.  If they are uncertain if any vegetation or bird or animal is protected, they check with our environmental group.<BR><BR>There is really no need to include a list.  No vegetation is allowed to grow on these sites.   They need to be kept as bare of vegetation, as possible.  Mainly for safety reasons, vegetation prevention is necessary because it can hide any water leaks which could cause damage to the dam.<BR><BR>If not familiar with the Navajo Dam site, a site visit is highly recommended. Site visits can be arranged by contacting Mr. Mike Velasquez at 505-632-3115.  Site visit expenses will be the responsibility of the potential contractor.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>AMENDMENT TWO:</p>
<p>The Request for proposal is hereby amended to address vendor questions.</p>
<p>Vendor Questions and Answers:</p>
<p>Question: Why does the RFP require manual switches when all the routines will control the cool down and warm up of the fridge?</p>
<p>Answer: We require manual switches in case the computer hardware or software malfunctions.</p>
<p>Question: Please can you give us the details of the computer you intend to use?<br />Answer: Dell PC with Windows.</p>
<p>Question: Why Maximum of 30 holes?</p>
<p>Answer: The government may require up to this number of holes for flexibility in mounting.</p>
<p>Question: Is there a required number of mounting holes by the experiment on each plate (or a minimum)?</p>
<p>Answer: The typical number will be less than thirty, and may be as small as zero.</p>
<p>Question: Why the request for government Consultation after the award? Is this to check there are no more than thirty holes? Or some other reason?</p>
<p>Answer: The reason is that, once the award has been made, and once the size and shape of each plate is determined, it will then be efficient to design the array of holes. <br />The Government , purely as an example, may ask for an array of 4-40 tapped holes on a square grid of 1" spacing. This example is NOT an additional requirement; we offer it as an example of what we might request in consultation after award.</p>
<p>Question: Will one system or two systems be purchased?</p>
<p>Answer: One.</p>
<p>QUESTION: 3He/4He gas mixture gas will be purchased from the vendor? Is this correct?</p>
<p>Answer: This is correct.</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>Computer: <br />The Contractor shall not provide a computer with the system. The Contractor shall install, and demonstrate all necessary software on a Government-supplied laboratory computer.</p>
<p>Despite specifying the computer requirements there could be some subtleties with an alternative computer supplier that could cause issues with the system. To minimise the costs and delays to either side we would like to explore the most efficient way forward:</p>
<p>&bull; Can NIST supply the computer to the vendor's site for us to integrate and use on test<br />Or<br />&bull; Can we install the system with our PC (offline) so the system is up and running quickly.</p>
<p><br />Answer: <br />1) The Government will not send a government-supplied computer to a test facility outside the United States. However, we do have the ability to send a government-supplied computer to a test facility inside the United States, and then have it returned to us. In order to do this, the contractor would have to assure us that the computer would stay inside the United States.</p>
<p><br />Question: Does the Principle investigator require a still shield in the magnet bore? <br />Answer: No, The still shield is not required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The AIT-2 system is used as a primary screening device to inspect a passenger's body for concealed weapons (metal and non-metal), explosives and other prohibited items. AIT takes into account passenger privacy considerations and employs safeguards to provide the maximum level of privacy protection to passengers. AIT is being upgraded to include Automated Target Recognition (ATR) capability which reduces privacy concerns and decreases passenger processing time. AIT-2 may also serve as a platform for potential integration of metal detection and/or shoe scanning capability.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

Further, the strategic decision is to establish a single process and standard of quality, for inspecting, repairing, and refurbishing all USAF Aerospace bearings. The capability will initially be established at Ogden and Oklahoma City Air Logistics Centers. The objectives of the initiative are as follows: expand the business base of aerospace bearing refurbishment within public-private partnerships; expand the pool of potentially reparable defense aerospace bearings, including other service and federal agency systems; improve item level cost, quality and/or schedule performance through aerospace bearing refurbishment; reduce Air Force total ownership cost through aerospace bearing refurbishment.

<DESC>16a. Description:
<p>The Defense Weather Systems Directorate (DWSD) Space Situational Awareness Environmental Monitoring (SSAEM) program office, on behalf of the United States Air Force, is seeking information from companies who could provide a production capability for Sixteen (12) space-based "TriG" Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Radio Occultation (RO) flight articles, providing total electron content (ionosphere), ionospheric scintillation , vertical refractivity, water vapor and temperature profiles in the troposphere. The companies should also provide options for the associated TriG-to-space vehicle integration and test support, and for commercially priced controlled storage facilities needed for the program. A flight article is defined as a fully functional sensor incorporating all the development efforts from Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The addition of the language "flight article" should not imply that we are requesting anything other than the standard GNSS RO sensor.</p>
<p>Data collected from the GNSS RO sensor can be used to measure ionospheric electron density characteristics and tropospheric weather information. A prototype of the TriG GNSS RO is currently in development by JPL and will be used to support the transition from an engineering model to flight quality sensors.</p>
<p>16b. Purpose:<br />This is a Sources Sought for market research purposes to identify potential organizations that can deliver the required products. Cost and schedule are major considerations; therefore, the Government is interested in estimated cost and schedule information based on independent organizations capability to deliver the TriG GNSS RO capability in a fully functional set of twelve sensors.</p>
<p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY. This sources sought is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotation) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This sources sought does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. We are not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this sources sought. All costs associated with responding to this sources sought will be solely at the responding party's expense.</p>
<p>All information received in response to this sources sought that is marked PROPRIETARY will be handled accordingly.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is issuing this Request for Proposal (RFP) to procure commercial services for secure transportation of detainees, medical escort, and facilities guard services to augment Agents and Officers performing law enforcement duties at and along the Southwest Border. In 2011, CBP apprehensions along the Southwest Border averaged 897 detainees per day that required transportation and guard services. CBP projects a continued requirement for approximately 450,000 hours of vehicle operational hours and 735,000 hours of labor operational hours over the course of each year to transport and guard the illegal aliens from their points of apprehension until they are either returned to their country of origin for repatriation or transferred to another agency for long-term detention. CBP lacks sufficient personnel and vehicular resources to support this requirement without impacting higher priority border security missions.
<p><br />CBP&nbsp;is utilizing Full and Open competition under NAICS code 561612&nbsp;in accordance with FAR Part 15 for a resulting performance-based single award indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) hybrid type contract for a term of 5 years (one 12 month Base Period and four 12 month Option Periods). The solicitation will include a mix of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Time and Material (T&amp;M) line items.</p>
<p><br />The scope of the requirement is for services of trained and certified security officers to operate vehicles along the Southwest Border in the transportation of detainees. Transportation services shall be provided by contractors (Transportation Officers) that have a Commercial Driver License (CDL) and can multi-task as both a driver on a detainee transport vehicle and as a facility or medical escort guard. When not driving, a Transportation Officer may be tasked to perform ad hoc guard functions at a facility or medical establishment. Facility/Medical escort services can also be performed by qualified contractor guards that do not require CDL; however, without a CDL, those contractors may not perform as a Transportation Officer. The government will not provide GFP. The contractor will be responsible for providing a full service solution. The resulting contract will provide efficient, flexible, responsive, safe and secure operations in a variety of circumstances, such as the following:</p>
<p>&bull; The gender, physical health, and risk associated with detainees will vary.<br />&bull; Apprehension locations and the number of illegal aliens apprehended per event and over time will vary.<br />&bull; Transports will frequently occur in a harsh and isolated environment.</p>
<p><br />An award will be made on a Best Value basis to the offeror who proposes a solution that is in the best interest of the Government. Performance requirements will be established that include but are not limited to the following areas:</p>
<p>- Operational Efficiency <br />- Operational Flexibility <br />- Operational Responsiveness <br />- Safety and Security</p>
<p><br />The operational area covers four states (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas) and nine (9) Southwest Border Sectors. Each CBP Sector is unique and has varying requirements, as follows:</p>
<p>- Del Rio<br />- El Centro<br />- El Paso<br />- Laredo<br />- Big Bend (Marfa)<br />- Rio Grande<br />- San Diego<br />- Tucson<br />- Yuma</p>

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract witha 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>NOTE:  Please note the change in the submission requirements.  Five copies of the SF 330 Parts I and II are now required instead of the original two copies requested originally.  Additionally, instructions have been added on how to access and post questions to ProjNet.  These directions can be found at the bottom of the synopsis.<br><br>1. Contract Information:  Transatlantic Division Middle East District (TAM) intends to award one contract to be procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  A firm will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  See Numbered Note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.  A-E services are required construction phase support services.  Additionally, as an option, the firm may be required to provide construction phase services needed to assist the Government in achieving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications for projects in accordance with the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED NC rating tool v2.2 and 2009/v3, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineering Construction Bulletin No 2014 issued 28 June 2010 and LEED requirements provided by TAM customers.  North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a size standard of $4.5 million in average annual receipts. This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  One indefinite delivery contract will be negotiated and awarded, each with one base year and four, 1-year option periods.  The amount of this contract will not exceed $90 million over the five year period (presuming the Government elects to exercise all option periods).  The total capacity may be used at any time throughout the life of the contract and the Government reserves the right to move the capacity forward as necessary to meet operational needs.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price, labor hour or cost reimbursable task orders.  Options will be exercised in accordance with FAR 52.217-9, Option to Extend the Term of the Contract.  The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under these contracts must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Services Contract Act, as determined relative to the employee's office location (not the location of the work).  Task orders awarded under the contract may occur throughout the US Central Command AOR, which includes the Middle East, the Arabian Gulf States, portions of Southwest and Central Asia, and portions of Africa.  Selected firms will be required to work in these areas, including Iraq and Afghanistan, and travel to these regions may be required.  FAR 52.232-18, Availability of Funds, is applicable to this contract, as funds are presently not available for this contract.  If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work that it intends to subcontract.  TAM Subcontracting goals are as follows: (a) 5% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with small business concerns; (b) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by HUBZones; (c) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by Service-Disabled Veterans; (d) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantage individuals; (e) 1% of the contract value subcontracted or performed with those small business concerns owned and controlled by women.  Contractor compliance with the Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be monitored through regular submission of reports into the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS).  This plan is not required with this submittal, but will be required with the fee proposal of the firm selected for negotiations.  To be eligible for contract award, a firm must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR).  Register via the CCR internet site at http://www.ccr.gov.  NOTE: All firms should be aware of the limitations of DFARS 236.602-70. This clause requires that A-E contracts funded by military construction appropriations that are estimated to exceed $500,000, and are to be performed in countries bordering the Arabian Gulf, can only be awarded to United States firms or to joint ventures of United States and host nation firms. TAM's AOR contains many countries that border on the Arabian Gulf such as Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman and Yemen. In fact, the majority of the countries where TAM has a current presence and construction work border the Arabian Gulf. Consequently, while this acquisition is to be issued as full and open to allow for the greatest amount of competition among qualified A-E firms, it is noted that at least 50%, if not more, of the task orders to be awarded (and, consequently, a majority of the total dollar value of task order awards) under the new A-E IDCs will be limited to U.S firms or joint ventures involving U.S. firms.  2. PROJECT INFORMATION: The firm will provide local national (LN), third country national (TCN), and/or US citizen subject matter experts to perform on-site construction phase support services for assigned projects in the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR).The positions for LN and TCN shall replicate typical foreign national service (FNS) employee positions obtained by U.S. Government Agencies to support overseas projects and locations.  TAM requires Construction Managers, Construction Schedulers, Data Managers, Office Managers, Project Engineers and Quality Assurance Representatives. These employees will gather information on contractor performance and report this information back to Government personnel. Government personnel will retain final decision-making authority on contractor performance. All work will be submitted in hardcopy format and/or through an automated system to Government personnel designed in each task order. As an option in this contract, the firm may be required to provide construction phase services needed to assist the Government in achieving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications.  3.
